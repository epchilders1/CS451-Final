But it has a really strong cast, strong production quality, and while the writing is the BEST, Keanu actually acts here... it isn't Shakespeare - he isn't a great actor - but this is one of his better outings.",

Keanu and Whitaker made the story really believable.\n\nThe backdrop of LA was perfect for this. Story screams attitude with a bit of over the top cop action but in a good way. Awesome flick for the guys.",

I cannot understand why this 2008 movie isn\u2019t rated higher?\nWatch the movie and judge it yourself. If you\u2019re looking for action and plot twists and more you\u2019ve found it.",

I was shocked when i came here and saw such a low rating so made an account here to review it myself. 10/10 for me I don't agree that it was predictable at all. I think it's a must watch movie.",

Yes, but his brutality is only directed at the bad of society. When he realizes those from his unit are worse than the bad guys he puts down, he seeks retribution.",

    "text": "Street Kings a predictable and sometimes boring action movie with a great cast of actors.\n\nThe characters are mostly stereotypical, Tom Ludlow is a good protagonist, but doesn't offer anything new or exciting. The dialogues are not bad, but there's nothing that stands out. The plot is predictable, but still enjoyable. A few characters' intentions were not clear by the end, that was confusing.\n\nThe cinematography was terrible. The slow motions were boring and some of the shots were really weird. The fight scenes were also badly-shot and edited, because I couldn't see anything. The pacing was okay, I wasn't bored because of it. The lack of excitement comes from the predictable story and the stereotypical characters.\n\nStreet Kings is not a movie I'll rewatch, but it was exactly the kind of goofy action movie I wanted to see.",

It deflates every suspenseful scene with its immaturity. It's like written by a 13 yo. \"You were a brother to me! I can't believe this is true. Was everything else a lie, too?\" It's \"The Room\" level dialogue paired with a decent attempt at a conspiracy movie.",
