    "text": "End of the Road is largely typical Netflix action fare, filled with clich\u00e9d moments and little else to set it apart. The acting isn't bad, and there are occasionally funny moments, but overall, the performances feel familiar and straightforward. This isn't a groundbreaking action-thriller or a fresh take on the genre, and it's not particularly worth watching. That said, I don't blame the actors; they did their best with a script that left much to be desired.",

Never pull the knife out till you have a tourniquet on or are at an Emergency Room. Even then the wound needs to be treated for possible infection. \n\nLudacris would be possible slowly dying at the end due to either bleeding out or infection and given that Queen Latifah was supposed to be an ER nurse, she would have known that.",

Queen Latifah goes from being an agreeable mom who will suffer for her kids to the momma bear who will do anything to protect them. She learns to stop accepting society as it is and takes justice into her owns hands. Lots of fun violent action and chase scenes. The twist is predictable but the action scenes are what make this movie so fun to watch.",

It tries, but 'End of the Road' isn't something I'd wanna revisit in a great hurry.\n\nQueen Latifah and Chris Bridges (aka Ludacris) are the film's only real positive, though I will say the change in directon of the story did fool me... so kudos for that. I actually think the twist makes the story weaker, but still. I found the pacing and dialogue to be off, it does attempt heart with the main characters but sadly it just doesn't come across as natural.\n\nYou could do worse, but this one fell unfortunately flat for me.",
