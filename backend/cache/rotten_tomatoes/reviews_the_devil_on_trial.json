    "text": "Enjoyable throughout, but definitely leaves way more questions than information (maybe that's the point though). Enjoyed some of the cinematography choices, shot framings, the reenacting, and real audio over actors voices, wish there was more of that. Not knowing this story before hand, I wish they had focused a little more on the character that is actually the one on trial per the namesake rather than the kid. The kid's story was important but I didn't expect it to be Arne and was just kinda like \"oh, that guy's who this is about?\" and felt like I didn't know almost anything about him.",

    "text": "A bad mix of b movie horror aspects and true crime case study. Save yourself the first 55 minutes, google who Ed and Lorraine Warren are, don't look at the articles yet keep it handy, then watch the final 20-30 minutes of ACTUALLY insightful details. It's literally all you need to know about this, avoid the trap of feeling sorry for this family(mostly the mother) and the two cons that had them play out this nightmare. A documentary on the Warren empire, and charlatans similar to them, would be much more enjoyable and appropriate in this day and age of over stuffed content and tired rhetorics. GIVE US FACTS AND AWFUL TRUTHS, we have enough side shows as it is.",

    "text": "\"The Devil on Trial\" certainly puts the 'mock' in mockumentary. While it promises to delve into the eerie world of demonic possession and a shocking murder, it falls flat on its face. The film seems more like a hastily assembled collection of reenactments and home videos rather than a true documentary.\n\nThe only thing truly possessed in this production is a lack of depth. I was hoping for some profound insights or new revelations, but it felt like a rehashed storyline we've seen in countless horror movies, including \"The Conjuring 3.\" In fact, it seems like \"The Devil on Trial\" could be a direct sequel to that film with its eerie reenactments.\n\nWhile the concept is intriguing, the execution is lacking, leaving you with the feeling that you've wasted your time. It's a devil of a disappointment, making you wonder if the devil made them do it, but it should be put on trial for masquerading as a documentary.",

    "text": "It was believable until the oldest brother, Carl, told his side of the story. At 23:35, when the Warren's were recording David, while his mother was telling him to Stop it, the father came out, slapped David and told him to \"get over there (pointing to the couch) and sit down\". And, guess what??? David walked over to the couch, and sat his \"possessed\" butt down. That was the debunking that it deserved.\nThen the book deal that the Warren's got from this...jeez, what a crock the story turned out to be. The family got 4500 dollars, while the Warren's collected over 80 thousand. Well, this wasn't the first time that they played a family like this.\nThe whole travesty of the film, and the story, is that Arne actually murdered a man and got away with it with a manslaughter charge that he was sentenced to 10 to 20 years, but only did three to four. He should have got the first degree murder and did 25 to life\nIt was a good scare in The Conjuring 3. But, it's about as true as Jason, Freddie, and Michael Myers. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

    "text": "The only reason I gave this 2.5 stars is I at least found it interesting. However, Ed and Lorraine Warren were in my opinion, complete fraudsters that took advantage of people. Listen to the recordings of the boy featured in the film, it's absolutely his voice, unaltered in any significant way whatsoever. The whole thing was BS and that family was led by the Warren's as to what to say, do, and how to act. And the guy who ends up committing the murder, doesn't remember anything because he was drunk, not possessed, but nice try. He got what he deserved, possibly not enough.",
