The acting was great built up expectations, but nothing really happened. That I could say was substantial, big fart movie. Don't recommend it. Don't waste your time.",

Bateman and Fey are wonderful and Drover lights up the screen (even though it\u2019s a little unbelievable that he\u2019s the \u2018baby\u2019 brother). The story is sad, funny, touching but not overly dramatic. true yo familial messy relationships.",

    "text": "I could listen to Jason Bateman and Tina Fey read a shopping list, but while the premise was interesting, it failed to follow through with it.  The actors did what they could, but the characters were simple and unconflicted.\n\nWhen characters too easily apologize for their own mistakes, I can only conclude that the character development in the book was left on the cutting room floor.  It's like telling just the punch line of a joke without the setup.\n\nOnce again, I'm reminded that I should look at reviews before spending my money on a Prime rental.",

    "text": "The raunchy humor is very hit-or-miss, half the characters are very unlikeable, and the dialogue can get awkward with exposition and borderline pretentious at times. However, the star-studded cast are doing the best they can with the so-so script and carry a lot of charm and chemistry with their scenes together. Despite my prior complaints, the movie can still be funny from time to time, usually whenever the main leads quit the raunchy one-liners and focus on more casual family moments like in the classroom scene. The story is kind of a mess, particularly with how the mother is framed more as a misguided quirky matriarch rather than the toxic emotional manipulator that she is. However, the rest of the story with the main siblings trying to find closure and meaning in their lives can be quite touching at times whenever it\u2019s not trying to be too melodramatic. Overall, it\u2019s a mixed bag, but I still had an okay time with it, and I\u2019m glad I finally got to watch it with my girlfriend after all these years of her hyping it up for me. I particularly like the ending symbolism with Jason Bateman\u2019s character venturing off to Maine on the highway to let loose and explore beyond on the horizon. Very relatable moment to conclude a messy but relatable movie.",

    "text": "Extraordinarily good ensemble film well-anchored by Jason Bateman as the thoughtful, world-weary straight man to his eccentric siblings and mother, played by a surprisingly sympathetic Jane Fonda.  The dialog ranges from good to crackling and I believed in all the characters and their life challenges.  Tina Fey, Adam Driver and Timothy Olyphant are at the tops of their respective games.  Highly recommended.",

It is difficult for me to NOT like something Bateman and Fey are in, but these screenwriter's were \"up\" to the task.  The ending is worthy of a teenage girl watching her dad try to dance at a wedding eye-roll.  Absolutely awful.",

It makes me want to have more kids and psychologically manipulate them so that they are guaranteed to turn into charming, yet self-destructive adults like the Altmans. I'll defend this movie to the death (but maybe I should really just read the book). Everyone's allowed to have a guilty pleasure.",
