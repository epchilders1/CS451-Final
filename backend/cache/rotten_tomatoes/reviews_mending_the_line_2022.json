I will likely introduce this movie to some family members who appreciate a soothing movie that moves along just as smoothly as the river that is fished upon, instead of one that hits you like a monsoon with non-stop action and special effects.",

It can feel impossible to break free from the circumstances we face, and it's extraordinarily difficult to find the elusive tools and methods to do so. We find ourselves hoping the dim light of hope won't disappear during the dark times, and temporary solutions that ultimately make everything worse. Absolute must see :) God bless our mess.",

The first fishing scene between the two main characters starts out mundane until they arrive at the river on foot, then stand still as the camera pans to sweeping long-range scenes of Montana mountains, and the music is a Lawrence of Arabia-style parody. Like they have never seen Montana before, when they live there. Then one turns to the other and says, \"wanna fish?\"",

The message of redemption and healing along with the beautiful Montana landscape is worth the time commitment.",

    "text": "This is an exceptional movie with Brian Cox and Wes Studi as stellar veteran actors who fit so easily into any storyline that they chose to perform in. Sinqua Walls, is a new actor to me and did a wonderful job as a marine with PTSD and all that the syndrome entails. Perry Mattefeld, who looks a bit like Jennifer Aniston, gives a sensitive, compelling performance in her role as well.\n\nThe storyline's pacing moved along well as the characters of Brian, Sinqua and Perry were explored more in-depth. The Montana skies and river scenes were beautiful and dynamic with the fishing lines floating through the air. I really appreciated the \"catch and release\" habit that this group of fly fishing people took to heart. \n\nThe musical score was brilliant and all encompassing. My Mom and I both thought we were listening to Alan Silvestri's magic and genius. We are now new and very admiring fans of Bill Brown's amazing musical composition talent and artistry. \n\n\"Mending the Line\" is a movie that will touch your heart and stay with you for a long time. The director, Joshua Caldwell, did not try to solve the key characters life issues but instead left them open to evolve and grow. The viewer is left with a sense of hope which is an excellent choice and movie ending. 5 Stars!",

How does every character look like they just had hair and makeup done, and all clothes ironed in EVERY scene. Looks like a movie that even Lifetime rejected. It needs (and has) flute and violin music to raise any emotion.  Was it directed by a grade school girl?",
