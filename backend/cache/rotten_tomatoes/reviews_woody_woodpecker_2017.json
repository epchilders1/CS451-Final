    "text": "Wacky and zany Woody Woodpecker combats a real estate developer lawyer and cartoonish forest poachers. However, the irritating and destructive CGI bird unintentionally plays villain to the audiences (all ages). He has his film crew and human actors to thank for this regrettable entertainment that's emotionally wooden, unfunny, and hyperactive. You may be watching in disbelief but not amusement. The film features cartoon violence, potty humor, naughty words, property destruction. Woody comically executes a construction worker, bird poops as a weapon, and pecks on heads.",

I support this film because it guides people not to cut trees and not to hunt animals to sell them. The woodpecker character represents people who like the environment and always try to save it, and it represents people who refuse bullying and try to help weak people. The film deserves more than five stars, and its rating isn't completely fair. I like this film and l recommend it.",
