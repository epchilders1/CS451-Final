No idea what the reason for ridiculously low rating is, perhaps everybody on the same bandwagon?, Anywhoooo, great cinematography, classic comic book style story, good visual effects and overall ambiance. Whole cast convincing in character and lots of action, mystery, twists and intrigue. One of my favorites, easy to watch",

    "text": "I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. I could say it is better than Daredevil, but that's not saying much. 2005's Elektra introduces some supernatural elements that it doesn't explain very well. Elektra somehow gained psychic abilities after being resurrected. There are multiple villains with supernatural powers as well, but I'm not sure if they were born with their abilities or gained them through training, etc. I'm also not sure what makes someone \"The Treasure\" or what \"The Treasure\" even is beyond being a MacGuffin. Most bewilderingly, though, is how that absolute flop of a movie Daredevil managed to get a spin-off. Between Ben Affleck's Daredevil and Jennifer Garner's Elektra she is definitely the superior of the two characters, but this movie feels unnecessary.",

    "text": "Maybe a couple of good things: Jennifer Gardner looks very hot and sexy throughout the film and some of the action wasn't too bad, however (onto the bad), too many things happened in the film that didn't make any sense at all. People die and people come back to life in ways that are either impossible or completely ridiculous and inconsistent. There were too many odd transitions, bad special effects, and the plot was way WAY too predictable! It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, I've seen much worse, but as far as superhero movies go this one is for sure a let down on many levels. They should've done a Daredevil 2 instead, I think even that would've been better!",

Otherwise, the movie is one of the worst Marvel movies ever made, but as a character, Jennifer Garner does a unique job in this role and I think she does well. She is much better than the one in Daredevil on NETFLIX. Naturally, Jennifer Garner in Daredevil with Ben Affleck does it even more uniquely, but unfortunately there is no sequel and there won't be. I'm going to see Deadpool & Wolverine on July 26th and I hope she's in, even if it's just a cameo!",

Now there were times where I had the slightest bit of entertainment value, but it gets ruined by cutting away to something else. It\u2019s not like the acting is terrible, but I didn\u2019t understand what was going on half the time, and the characters didn\u2019t help with that at all. Right from the get go this movie was a jumbled mess. This movie doesn\u2019t have any basic storytelling structure! There was no climax, there was no resolution, there wasn\u2019t even really a theme. I thought that the first Daredevil was pretty bad, but seeing how bad this is made me realize how fortunate I was when watching Daredevil, not having to sit through Elektra.",

    "text": "\"Elektra\" is a painfully flat and soulless film that falls laughably short of its comic book roots. Jennifer Garner\u2019s acting is shockingly bad; her performance as Elektra is wooden and emotionless, making it hard to root for her. Abby, the supposed victim, is incredibly annoying, to the point where I found myself disliking her more than the villains. The film is a dreary slog with underdeveloped characters and an absurd lack of action for an action movie. Terence Stamp as Stick is a rare highlight, delivering a performance that is both decent and comic-accurate. However, his efforts are wasted in this dull, uninspired spinoff that no one asked for. The storyline is boring and unengaging, leaving little to no impression. In short, \"Elektra\" is a misfire that fails to capture the essence of the comics and offers nothing but disappointment. Skip this one; it's not worth the time.",
