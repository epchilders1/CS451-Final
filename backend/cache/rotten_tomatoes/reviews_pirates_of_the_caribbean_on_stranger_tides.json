Blackbeard was a great villain. As much as I love Will and Elizabeth, it was great just not having to shoehorn them in for one film and let us see Jack and Barbosa banter.",

    "text": "Now the trilogy is finished, a reshuffle is needed to freshen things up and this really tries to do that.\nIt's better to free your mind of what's been before to truly settle into this but it's still a lovely looking movie with good performances from Ian McShane - brilliantly cast as Blackbeard - and Penelope Cruz who you feel should have been introduced before this such is her suitability.\nIt's not quite as epic as the previous and though it contains a lot of darkness, it's more light-hearted and has the reigns on it. Jack Sparrow feels like part of this movie rather than the heart of it but he's still very entertaining and Kevin McNally is given more to work with.\nIt's decent but not amazing",

    "text": "What a completely forgettable installment that is bland & boring with the spark of this franchise clearly not present. The overdone hijacks of Jack Sparrow is worn out & sadly he cannot carry this franchise alone. The sexual humor/tension doesn\u2019t fit at all & feels so forced & weird. The adventure tone is solid yet anything interesting plot wise happens offscreen & everything shown feels like a lazy spinoff for this world. A few cool moments that are filmed well but for how big the budget is, this film does not look great visually.",

The biggest issue the audience often had with Dead Man's Chest and At World's End (being the interwoven and very expansive plot line) just got completely dismantled and raggedly put together in some of the worst storyboarding I've seen in months, don't get me wrong, the gags are great and it's still a good film, it's definitely still \"Pirates\", it's just nowhere near the level the last 3 had us all stoked about.",
