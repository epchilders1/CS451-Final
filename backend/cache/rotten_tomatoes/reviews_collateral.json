    "text": "Excellent for this crime genre, as the screenplay is fresh, Foxx and Pinkett-Smith are great, and the big spread out LA  at night is wonderful.   \n\nCruise is a bit too decent at times to be a psychopathic hit man, and the ending is a bit thin and too conventional -- for a movie that built something special, in terms of existential struggles and questions of meaning.  However, the movie is so strong, these are not more than mildly off putting.",

    "text": "Collateral pairs two big names- Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, in a gripping and unexpected way. As a fan of Jamie Foxx (less so of Cruise), I was delighted to see him portray a softer, hopeful character trying to find his way, while Cruise plays an intense, relentless hitman who pushes Foxx\u2019s character to grow. \n\nBy the end, Foxx evolves into a confident hero, protecting the damsel in distress, played by Zoe Saldana (curiously, Jada Pinkett is mentioned in the cast, but she isn\u2019t in this film).\n\nWith plenty of twists and turns, and strong support from actors like Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, Collateral is a fun and engaging watch. A real treat!",

    "text": "All Time Classic. You know the cinematography is really good but it can be a bit dull looking and basic. It's all on location and looks great still. The action scenres are really good too. Everything else is just first rate and this has Mann's style all over it. The story takes twists and turns you'll never see coming and buids perfectly. The ending is on the edge of your seat thriller stuff of the highest order. Everyone should give this a try once.",

    "text": "3.5 stars; A good thriller. Michael Mann is certainly comfortable when he is in his niche. Jamie Foxx made an excellent transition from comedian to serious actor. In this case, he played a simple cab driver who gets caught up in a whirlwind of murder when he picks up a hitman for a fare. Tom Cruise did his usual professional job, giving a believable portrayal of a ruthless hitman, hired to eliminate witnesses for a crime boss. Foxx was able to create empathy for his character, who's a loner with big dreams, seeing them fly out the window when he falls victim to circumstances. I realize the plot is a little bit of a stretch in places, especially the ending... but hey, it's a movie. Enjoy the ride!",

    "text": "The main plot along with Cruise was great. Only three  stars as the character played by Fox was not real. I understood he initially wanted to escape, but for no believable reason, he morphs from a nobody cab driver dreamer into hero who believes he can take on a professional assassin an save the life of a woman who he briefly met, putting the life of his mother at risk. That was unforgivable. This morphing into an hero was ill-conceived and tragically pathetic, ruining what otherwise was an interesting thriller.",
