However despite this it brings another compelling story for the audience to love and a great new addition to the universe.",

I'll close this review by saying positive opinions for the 8th film but the saga has declined since Paul Walker no longer exists but it's still a good film, see you.",

    "text": "The story is so ludicrous that I dont know how this didnt get a worse rating overall.  So Dom's ex gf is kidnapped by Charliese and dragged around in a flying fortress (that never needs refueling ala agents of shield) until the kid is so old that it can say \"Dada\"??  And they give her fresh clothing, makeup, and she/they actually look relatively happy?  And Dom is willing to give up the world to save them without telling anyone what's up?  And then Charliese kills the mom with the kid in the same room, in front of Dom, to try and convince him to toe the line?  WHAT THE EF? Why go through all the trouble to just kill her?\n\nNot to mention the zombie car chase in NYC could never have happened with the old clunkers they used in the scene, even if you didnt consider the NYC traffic which would have stopped it in about 10 seconds. The cars jumping out of windows of old buildings (a la Cap-Civil War), guess what--- that's not how cars are stored in NYC.\n\nAlso, submarines dont launch themselves b/c you turn them on. Also, starting a sub in a dry-dock, without ocean water running through its heat exchangers, would kill it quickly. \n\nTechnology, Dom and other craziness aside, why did Charliese want Dom so badly as her henchman?  She took a \"no thanks\" from Statham but went all out to get Dom; a streetcar driver?  She couldnt find one more willing bad-guy, anywhere, with her endless resources?  \n\nAnd Dom was willing to put Letty in endless harms way? How in the world can she or anyone else EVER trust him again? No matter the reasons, his actions of betrayal and willful blindness to the effect of his assaults, batteries, and property destruction, were so outrageous that they absolutely cannot be forgivable, and you'd expect him to spend the next several hundred years, justifiably, in jail. \n\nProbably the saving grace to this otherwise ridiculous movie was Statham and Johnson, who are a blast to watch together. Statham was FINALLY allowed to use some of (hints of) his comedic talent in this one, thankfully. For those scenes alone, and really for nothing else, this gets 2 stars.",
