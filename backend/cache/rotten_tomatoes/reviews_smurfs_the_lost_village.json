    "text": "The reason why I watched Smurfs: The Lost Village when I was 11 because this is the best CGI animation ever, but some scenes are scared like Garagamel capturing Smurfs at Smurfy Grove. I love the voices and quotes such as Trust us, he's a goner or Well, I know 4 Smurfs who have some explaining to do. I love the movie ending called I'm a Lady after Smurfette revives. I can't stop listening to that until am out of high school.",

    "text": "Smurfs: The Lost Village wasn\u2019t that great for me. The animation looks good, sure, but the story feels way too simple and mostly for little kids. Everything happens super fast, and the jokes aren\u2019t that funny \u2014 kind of silly, actually. The characters don\u2019t really have depth, and the whole \u201cnew village\u201d idea seemed cool at first, but they didn\u2019t really do much with it. Honestly, it\u2019s a forgettable movie. If you\u2019ve seen the older ones, this one just feels like more of the same, but weaker.",
