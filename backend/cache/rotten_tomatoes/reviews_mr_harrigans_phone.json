    "text": "Many critics dismissed Mr. Harrigan\u2019s Phone because it has no monsters, no gore, no jump-scares. That\u2019s exactly why it deserves five stars. Horror is not about claws or fangs, it is about dread, temptation, and the uncanny slipping into everyday life. This film captures that perfectly.\n\nAt its heart, it is a chilling fable about the danger of \u201cif wishes came true.\u201d Craig discovers that with a single call, death arrives. The true horror is not a ghost in the shadows, but the seductive danger of power, justice on demand, at a terrible cost. The phone becomes a modern \u201cneedful thing,\u201d a trap disguised as a gift.\n\nThe film itself is beautifully restrained. Its pacing is deliberate, its atmosphere quiet but tense. Performances from Jaeden Martell and Donald Sutherland carry the story with subtlety, showing grief, mentorship, and temptation with remarkable depth. The lack of spectacle is a strength; it keeps the focus on character and morality rather than cheap thrills.\n\nWhat makes the story powerful is Craig\u2019s choice to walk away. He rejects the cursed phone before it owns him. That is survival, not triumph. It lingers because it is real horror: quiet, unsettling, and moral. For me, this stands alongside Eyes of the Dragon as one of King\u2019s most thoughtful tales.\n\nIf you want a scare, here you go:  Boo!",

    "text": "I loved this movie. I had went in expecting horror, but was instead pleasantly surprised by the absolute stunning story. I thought it would be a lot more of a supernatural thriller, but I\u2019m not disappointed with what I got, not at all. \n\nIt\u2019s beautiful. Acting was great, I thought the pacing of the story was well timed, cinematography was amazing, story itself was brilliant, and just everything about it was wonderful. I never really get this into movies, but I genuinely loved this one. I turned it on as background noise as I worked on a puzzle, but ending up almost only watching the movie.\n\nIt\u2019s just such a masterpiece and the only thing I have to say is I just wish they expanded Mr. Harrigan\u2019s story a little more. Felt like we spent so much time with him to know so little. Other than that, I honestly don\u2019t have any other big complaints. Go check it out. Totally recommend.\n\nPs. A lot of the lower reviews are talking about the pacing and lack of horror, so if you don\u2019t mind it being a little slow (at least to start with) and there being no actual jumpscares, don\u2019t worry about that",

Don't go in expecting horror! \n\nAs a huge King fan, I was pleasantly surprised how this movie turned out. It's not as good or deeply emotional as the written story, but rarely do his characters' intensities come through on screen. That said, the cast did well with the material.",

Donald Sutherland is the highlight but little else is worthy of praise - takes over 40 minutes to get to the heart of the story but the heart is more ponderous than the build up. What is this film? thriller? horror? Psychological drama? Whatever it's trying to be it does a poor job of it.",

In another scene where the boy reads the book whilst the old man seemingly ignores him whilst using his phone is priceless.

The plot could have driven a great horror story, instead it's just an adolescent coming of age melodrama, with one creepy idea and very little drama.",
