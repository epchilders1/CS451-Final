Battles ensue.\n\nAlthough this film was planned as a conclusion to the series long before the show was over, it still feels like a half season, if not a full season, crammed into two hours.  It has strong production values and enjoyable battle scenes.  I don't think anyone that hasn't watched the series would enjoy it.  I did but not as much as I'd hoped.",

The fight scenes are some of the weakest out there, with Uhtred constantly lost on the battlefield and searching for Aethelstan. For the greatest warrior of that era, it\u2019s quite disappointing. All in all, it\u2019s a film that tries to be epic but never rises above mediocrity.",

    "text": "Honestly, I wish I had never watched the final story of Uhtred. This movie was sloppily assembled as if rushed by writers sick of their job. They couldn't even find a one-liner for Finan. Scenes did not blend well. Lines were weak. Too many story to ines in too short of a time period. Even the cinematography was weak and immediately noticeable. A fictitious and current social storyline was added that ultimately only served to add one more piece to this dollar store puzzle. It was done without the time and writing to support and develop only to have the character dramatically realize the errors of his ways and be welcomed back with open arms then boom movie over.  Where is the bullshit*t flag, this play needs to be called for what it is bullshit*t.\n\nHalf of the actors did not join this film and of the ones that did a number of them met an untimely ending for which little time was spent allowing the characters to respond. Then they finished it all off with  nearly laughable CGI, were it not truly sad to see them ruining my wonderful memories of the show. I wish I could scrub my memory clean of this movie.",

    "text": "As a big fan of the series, which was done very well and wrapped up quite nicely at the end of season 5, the movie was disappointing. It really should have been a 6th season rather than a film because it felt incredibly rushed, a bit all-over-the-place, ruined/insulted a few characters that were built up over a long time in the show, and barely managed to cobble together a halfway satisfactory ending. In fact, looking through those doors at the end was the best moment of the film by far for me, despite even that scene omitting a couple of key people who really should have been present. Everything else felt hollow and rushed.\n\nAll in all, not even close to the ending you'd hope for for such a beloved, intricate and emotional series. I wish I hadn't watched it. If you read this before watching, please save yourself the disappointment and just stick with season 5's ending.",

How you spend years creating a character and think you can sell the fact that no matter how loyal that character is, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER he has sworn to protect betrays him is ridiculous.
