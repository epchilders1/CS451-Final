Although I liked Copy Cat just as much and the cast was fantastic!\n\nThis is the type of movie that I have missed seeing in movie theaters in recent years: strong ensemble casts(with movie stars), good quality across the board.\n\nThis movie could fall into the horror or scare category, as what is more scary than knowing these people exist in the world!",

The creators selected a cast that elevates the quality of the production, a score that renders it a feature that I consider to be a classic of its own genre enthralling, and sets that immerse you as a viewer in its universe. With fascinating characters, an astounding cinematography, and a compelling narrative, Copycat's producers provided us with an ambitious project that showcases that smartly combining aspects of visual storytelling can generate a production that is ambitious, unique, and that has the capacity to have spectators caught up in an experience that is entertaining, gripping, and appealing to most that enjoy cinema.",

    "text": "Though serial killer mysteries and thrillers often never seem to disappoint, Copycat does fail to deliver interesting protagonists despite featuring an unsettling villain. Directed by Jon Amiel, Copycat is a film that follows San Francisco homicide detectives that enlist the help of an agoraphobic criminal psychologist to find the disturbing serial killer whose victims are murdered in same way as previous victims of known serial killers. Starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter, Copycat spends majority of the film building the trauma of its protagonist rather than establishing depth. \n\nWhile I think that Sigourney Weaver is consistently fantastic in all of her films, the major flaw of Copycat is that the film does not deliver substantial a characterization for its protagonist. Personally, I think Holly Hunter was slightly miscast. Dermot Mulroney is unfortunately forgettable. Besides Sigourney Weaver, the cast of Copycat is rather dull with minimal risk-taking. Copycat does succeed in establishing some unsettling moments. When the film is portrayed from the point of view of its agoraphobic protagonist, the intensity and tension created is impressively high. \n\nOverall, Copycat is an entertaining mystery with some haunting moments, but the overall story is one that feels clich\u00e9. Sigourney Weaver commands the screen but her character is underdeveloped.",
