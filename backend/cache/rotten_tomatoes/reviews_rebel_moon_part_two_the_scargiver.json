I almost didn\u2019t watch these; as I don\u2019t like obvious mostly cgi movies that are basically constant shoot outs and fight scenes with no real story just the same old boring poor excuse to make a dumb movie purely to show the \u2018pow pow pow\u2019 and backflips on repeat or these days even unnecessarily disgusting scenes. But I was pleasantly surprised, the story actually has a lot of potential and I liked the depth of the worlds that have been set up and I\u2019m really interested to learn more about the worlds and universe. I liked it so much that I watched both movies back to back and I\u2019m the kind of person that sci-fi can bore me and not hold my attention to the point I zone out and miss most of the movie. This had me captivated throughout and feeling fortunate that I was able to watch them back to back and the story continued really seamlessly. I will say though that it felt like one movie and not two so the experience may have been different for those watching these separately. These movies set an interesting foundation, I would like the next movie to add depth to the story and tell us more about the mother world and the universe set up and its history. It\u2019s a very good start but feels like the first few chapters of a book and I want the rest!  I don\u2019t think this series of movies can be judged until they next one or two are made - the treatment of the next instalments will evidence the level of depth the story has and whether it is good overall.",

    "text": "Posting in the 2nd movie as well I just fully watched in un sitting both movies I don\u2019t get why people are hating it, yes it was more visual effects than character development however this has the potential of becoming a great universe, if they actually do create the 6 movies or more it will be awesome, people need to understand that now a days you first need to capture the eyes of the audience if you\u2019re doing something from scratch and then slowly develop it into a full universe, most movie universe that we have are based on books or comics but this is something new with inspiration of things that we have seen but still has its own uniqueness so I\u2019m excited to see what they bring next!",

I did watch both of the directors cuts of the film i think that its the way to go if you take time to watch part 1 and 2. Highly recommended especially if you are a sci-fi movie fan!",

If you like sci-fi movies and hero stories you'll absolute like the 2 Rebel Moon movies with a good and entertaining story although it's not original at all. It's Netflix streaming movies so they're not perfect and probably don't have a huge budget but they're absolutely much better than the latest Star Wars movies. Watch it!",

Once again the action sequences and scriptwriting were poorly done, but the movie had amazing visuals and some enjoyable moments. It was definitely fun to watch, and I would put it in the 'it's so bad it's good' movie category. While the Rebel Moon saga has its flaws, I am curious to see how the rest of the story unfolds, so I am fully on board with Rebel Moon: Part Three.",
