So, in order to watch the movie (waiting hopefully for her to drown which I doubt is going to happen), I have to not look at her because watching her pinning her shoulders back to an unnatural degree in order to make her breasts stick out even more makes me sick and watching an entire movie without looking at one of the characters is not easy.  There should be \"booby\" prizes for this sort of thing !",

    "text": "Watch this mainly for the shark attack footage, which is surprisingly well done for a low budget movie. The first half of the movie is slow, but the second half grabs your attention, especially when the villains arrive and the shark action picks up. As for the sentimental and human interest part of the plot, it\u2019s banal and uninteresting but doesn\u2019t take too much screen time, so you can ignore it. The female lead is more eye-candy than actress, but good acting is not the strong suit of this film anyway.",
