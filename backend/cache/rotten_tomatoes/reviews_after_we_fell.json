    "text": "After We Fell continues the After franchise by delivering new ways for our lovesick leads to fall apart. Though audiences have endured 2 full-length feature films, After We Fell remains consistent by mostly recycling old plot points. With some new 'surprises' popping up throughout, the After series is never short of convoluted drama at every turn.\n\nWhile reconnecting with her father, troubled Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) foolishly falls back into her relationship with the emotionally unstable Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). Now both dealing with daddy issues, the pair explore their past, while struggling with their future. Though every other character watches this embarrassing relationship progress, the leads inexplicitly cling to their toxic instability.\n\nShortly after watching this, I could not differentiate it from the past 2 installments and found myself struggling to remember which film had which arguments and which break-ups were caused by whose disloyalty/honesty. After We Fell holds a very rare honor by barely sticking with me and remaining indiscernible from the rest of the series. This truly belongs in the Sewers of Cinema.",

Unfortunately, this installment falls short, making it the weakest link in the trilogy.",

    "text": "The worst movie of the trilogy. Honestly, the movie has no head or tail. This incomplete, many issues were addressed that were not relevant in the end. The film takes place between Tessa and Hardin's fight over their long-distance relationship. But, other topics like Tessa's father were not important, perhaps as an influence for Hardin to leave Alcohol. Other than that most of the movie is just sex and toxic fights. Tessa's condition never develops even in conversation with her partner. Hardin is a person with many problems, we know that from the previous parts, that's why the ending was surprising and dramatic, but it destroys everything addressed and built in the previous movie. As far as I understand it is the basis for the last movie which makes sense; But as a movie, it leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "2 out of 5 stars. Third film in the series that has yet to develop the characters from the beginning of the first film. Which characters fail to grow and change. Hero Fiennes Tiffin still is the most annoying character with mood swings and whiny about everything. Josephine Langford is still flat with her character. No plot. No conflict besides Harin emotional about Tessa for doing her own thing or his family issues. The film is pointless and just giving or attempting steamy sex scenes and a story that goes nowhere again. Maybe the fourth film will break away from the terribleness.",
