They had some material to work with then either or both the director just went south, begins to develop here and there then the obligatory american movie cliches pop up, Connick can not act and the scene on the stage was horrible, so he is drunk after one cocktail? Angi was decent given the script. Not worth the time...",

    "text": "Loved this film and am surprised by so many bad reviews - it's not obvious - it has a presumably deliberate tounge-in-cheek quality yes, but it's not trying to be too serious. It's creative, refreshing and uplifting in a way so many movies fail to be these days. A new firm favourite film of mine. I love the slightly dry humour at points throughout - and the camerawork is a thing of beauty as is the scriptwriting - it delivers a serious message as well as a relaxed and creative vibe all at once. It\u2019s not perfectly delivered, nor perfectly written but we don\u2019t live in a perfect world. It\u2019s a bit rough around the edges but aren\u2019t we all? This movie brings great acting talent together with some beautiful songs, great comedy and thought-provoking moments. I love it!",

    "text": "Solid if predictable rom-com with an appealing performance from Harry Connick Jr as likeable has-been rock star John Allman, who has bought a clifftop house on the island of Cyprus to get away from it all and figure out the next steps in his ailing music career. The script doesn't break any new ground, and before you're halfway in you'll have already encountered many of the usual tropes of the genre. But the tropes are executed well, the characters are easy to care about, and if you're in the mood for some throwaway feelgood then you could do far worse.",

My Mom recently passed, so hearing them speak Cypriot made me smile. Its a romantic comedy and why does it have to be incredible to be good when it can simply be light?",

None of the actors struck me as very good, and none of the characters made you root for them. Things like the ridiculous \u201cfence\u201d storyline were just bad, and not at all believable. I predicted every significant event in the story.  Finally, HCJ\u2019s hair looks distractingly like a wig (maybe it is?). I couldn\u2019t stop staring - maybe because the story couldn\u2019t hold my attention for more than 30 seconds at a time. I can\u2019t believe the critic rating isn\u2019t worse.",

Ali Fumiko Whitney (Melina) was a welcome fresh face as the recently discovered daughter of Harry Connick Jr. (John) who assists with rekindling the long ago romance with Agni Scott (Sia).  Placed in Greece, the small town atmosphere was touching and added to the story.",
