Yet I feel that these supposed critics have decided to scrap all over this movie because they have had to do some thinking and reading of subtitles during Chinese speaking parts.",

It\u2019s an hour and 43 minutes of my life I\u2019ll never get back. The script is terrible, storyline is terrible and the effects can be done better on an iPhone with a few apps. \n\nThe budget must have been that of a college project. The main actors deserved better.",

The plot was poorly written, and the exploitation of resources by a private Chinese corporation that did not hire any locals, did not make them to be such a saintly group after all. It wasn't believable, and I had to stop watching.",

Cheesiest lines ever,  even worse than me after a couple drinks at the bar.  An 8 or 9 year old would likely enjoy this movie.  I would expect a fifth grader to have better taste however.",

Was some interesting camera work even though it was manipulated with not great CG it was still impactful however this mess of a film just dragged off and became something of a background movie, is much better martial art buddy films to watch.",
