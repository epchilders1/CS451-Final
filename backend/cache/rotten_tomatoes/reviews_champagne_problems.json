Ugh. \nSwitched off.",

Perhaps irrelevant to others, but when it occurs less than 10 minutes into the movie, I have to wonder just how ill-informed or just plain lousy the writer(s) are (sorry).  Sister says to leading lady that they promised each other they would \"see the world\" when they grew up and then she brags:\n\n\"I walked the Great Wall of China\" and....and....(wait for it)....\n\n\"I HIKED THE PYRAMIDS OF MACHU PICCHU\".   Pyramids?   seriously.  Pyramids?    no can hike the pyramids at Machu Picchu.  There ain't a single one at Machu Picchu.  It was the bucket list trip of my life so I can say w/o a doubt.  Ain't no pyramids.  You can hike for sure.  But you're hiking up a mountain trail.  (I didn't. I took the train.  I was 75 when I visited).  Writers!!  C'mon.  it's not hard to google about places.  \n\nSorry for the ramble.  But this one really bothered me.",

    "text": "Lovely scenery all around, sympathic and/or charming or funny characters, lots of humour. The mostly predictable story does not reduce the good feelings this movie gave me all around ! The makers also came up with a few anachronistic characters and even a few less expected twists that added to the overall entertainment.  \n\nI had never heard of the main actors before but really loved their performance. I do not want to go into developments here because of spoiling surprises, save for one: an Italian billionaire son turns up who is actually not at all serious about wine making or running a business, but just into having fun with all his money. The comic relief ? Or is that intended to be the very stiff and clumsy German... well, just go see it if you have not already and enjoy the anachronistic add-ons, the very charming very nice French Father with the equally charming accent (thank heaven for French speaking English and God forbid the English speaking French with a fat English accent !) and the chemistry between the very goodlooking (of course) main actors.",

    "text": "I just finished watching Champagne Problems on Netflix and I absolutely loved it. First of all, the setting was in Paris which felt so refreshing since most Christmas movies are always in New York or Chicago. It was beautiful to see a different city for once and the Paris backdrop made the whole film feel extra magical. My  favourite was Roberto played by Sean Amsing. I have always been an enormous fan of the actor John Lovitz and Roberto\u2019s hilarious personality gave me total John-Lovitz! He absolutely stole every scene he appeared in. One of my favourite quotes from the movie is when Roberto says, \"Doesn\u2019t matter if your glass of champagne is half full or half empty, as long as the glass is refillable.\" That line alone deserves an award. Overall this movie has the perfect mix of witty silliness, a bit of cheese (or should I say fromage), a sweet storyline and gorgeous scenery. Five stars from me. A must-watch for the holidays. Oh, and let\u2019s also give five stars to the dog bubbles \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd42",
