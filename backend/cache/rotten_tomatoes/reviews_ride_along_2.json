    "text": "A slapstick and horribly written movie, Ride Along 2 does not meet the standards for a sequel that it should. In addition to the film\u2019s atrocious storyline, Kevin Hart plays a terrible role in this movie, continuing to be as pathetic as he was in the first movie, along with Ken Jeong who makes the film worse with his overly eccentric character. The script was not well executed, it was not well written, and it, like the mighty Titanic, was doomed for failure. In conclusion, this movie deserves the low ratings that it has, and I do not recommend this for any person.",
