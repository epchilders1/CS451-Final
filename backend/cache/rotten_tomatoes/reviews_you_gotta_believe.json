    "text": "I wanted to believe, but found myself questioning- did I watch a different movie than the other audience reviews? I wanted to like this movie, however the editing was jarring, the cinematography was stylistically odd, and the baseball moments rushed. These elements would have been forgivable if the filmmaker had a clear vision of what he wanted this movie to be. Unfortunately, much like the ham-fisted dramatic vomit scenes, the themes were all over the place- so much so that none of it hit home. Even the title betrayed how the movie played out. You gotta give us a reason to believe.",

    "text": "As a movie, it\u2019s ok and follows the story line of many similar movies. If you know the actual story, there\u2019s just too much that doesn\u2019t seem accurate. I highly doubt the team wasn\u2019t how it was portrayed, with kids who couldn\u2019t hit or catch in the beginning. I remember watching them play in 2002, it was made up of talented baseball players and that\u2019s why they were so successful at the LLWS. Walker Kelly was also left handed and not at all like the goofy uncoordinated kid in the movie. He was a great pitcher, who I believe went on to play in college.",

The movie struggles to bring the depth needed to the characters to make us feel connected and really cheer them on.",
