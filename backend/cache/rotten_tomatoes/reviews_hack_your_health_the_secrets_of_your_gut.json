And I think an hour and a half long movie just to say that eat more veggies was waste of time so yes definitely could have explained the complexity of gut and body connection more.",

The use of the Muppets and animations certainly make it family friendly, but do nothing to help inform the audience on the science.  Consider this baby's first step into the world of the gut microbiome.",

The solution of eating fruits and vegetable was overly simplistic. I would have liked it better if they had left out the scene making the homemade poop pills.",

It is easy to watch and gives you a good understanding of how the gut works and the gut is not just mechanical but live bacteria that live off the types of food we feed them makes a difference. Eat great food and encourage beneficial bacteria.",
