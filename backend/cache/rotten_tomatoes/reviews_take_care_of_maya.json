    "text": "This documentary is extremely aggravating because we all know this is almost exactly how twisted the system is & cant do a thing about it. Theres good people & bad people with child protective services, you never know who youll be dealt. We have these mental institute belonging cat lady Karens like the one here, who either want a child & cant have one so they prey on other people\u2019s children or theyre just plain mentally ill and miserable and search desperately for reasons to be able to get satisfaction by tripping over their power in removing children from their homes. The system also sides with these people because they all work together & the system is overall complete trash. \n\nIn this situation there was absolutely zero ABUSE sensed from the mother, the ketamin was advised and prescribed by the doctors & the only thing that took the child\u2019s pain away. The mother was not opposed to them using any other method that ensured her child wasnt in pain, they just were mad at her tone which isnt a reason to destroy a child\u2019s life by removing them from their parents because youre weak minded and cant handle an argument with a worried parent, which by the way IS YOUR JOB TO DO.   They responses from sally smith and the other doctor after the mother died was absolutely desgusting. You guys are pigs. Pig is cleaner than you. \n\nThat all being said, it was absolutely  selfish of the mother to do that having two children who need her. No doubt there. Shes weak and selfish ahd wrong for that but had she abused her child by overmedicating?",

It does not merit the label \u201cdocumentary.\u201d None of the evidence pointing to Maya truly being a victim of medical child abuse was presented, and no education on what this form of abuse entails was presented. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves. They have put more children in harms way and have made the job of child protection much harder.",

    "text": "This is not unbiased journalism. How is it that in approximately a year, the child went from wheelchair bound and \"likely to die\" from CRPS, a non-fatal condition, to walking with crutches after receiving only physical therapy. What, loving, caring mother would kill herself at the time her child needed her most. If Beata was such a strong woman, why would she kill herself after being temporarily separated from one child  when she had another young child at home who needed her. Seems like there is a lot more to this story.",

    "text": "This documentary falls grossly short of the responsibility documentary filmmakers hold in presenting complex stories. Its one-sided portrayal risks perpetuating significant misconceptions about both this specific case and medical child abuse in general. The potential for this misinformation to negatively impact public understanding and, consequently, future victims, is deeply concerning. The film's apparent lack of care in its storytelling is troubling. Seeking additional, balanced information is crucial for those wanting a true understanding of the situation. A dialogue with the filmmakers about the film's impact, particularly on mandated reporters, would be valuable. The film's accuracy is seriously questionable, and the need for accountability should be considered.",

    "text": "The title of the documentary, \"Take Care of Maya\" is drawn from an email draft left by Maya's mother, Beata, to her husband Jack Kowalski. This Netflix documentary tells the story of the Kowalski family from Florida. Maya Kowalski, the daughter of Jack Kowalski and Beata Kowalski, who was rushed in emergency to John Hopkins All Children's Hospital in 2016, where hospital management deliberately and medically abducted Maya and blamed her mother, Beata, of child abuse.\n\nThe documentary sent shockwaves across the country and beyond for the distress and trauma experienced by the Kowalski family, who also lost Beata Kowalski, who committed suicide after being accused of child abuse and refused permission to visit her detained daughter for three months.\n\nThe Kowalski family is now resolved to sue John Hopkins All Children's Hospital for causing them trauma and to prevent other families from going through the same ordeal. Jack and Maya proclaim to be fighting for Beata Kowalski, a fighter who never caved in to bogus accusations.\n\nThe Kowalski family was awarded $261 million in punitive damages by the jury in early November 2023. However, as Maya Kowalski stated, no amount of money will bring her mother back.",

    "text": "\u201cTake Care of Maya\u201d is a deeply moving and thought-provoking documentary that sheds light on the harrowing experiences of the Kowalski family. The film follows the story of nine-year-old Maya Kowalski, who was admitted to Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s Hospital in 2016 with a rare illness. As the medical team struggled to understand her condition, they began to question the family\u2019s dynamics, leading to Maya being placed in state custody despite her parents\u2019 desperate attempts to bring her home.\n\nFor someone involved with the Department of Children and Families (DCF), this documentary is particularly impactful. It highlights the complexities and challenges faced by families and healthcare professionals when dealing with rare medical conditions and the child protection system. The film captures the frustration and agony of being caught in a system that sometimes prioritizes suspicion over compassion.\n\nThe documentary is both heart-wrenching and infuriating, as it exposes the flaws in the healthcare and child protection systems. It leaves viewers with a sense of urgency to advocate for better understanding and support for families in similar situations. While the film does not provide easy answers, it encourages viewers to reflect on the importance of empathy and the need for systemic change.\n\nOverall, \u201cTake Care of Maya\u201d is a powerful and essential watch for anyone involved in child welfare, as it underscores the importance of balancing medical investigation with compassion and understanding.",

    "text": "To call this a \"documentary\" is insulting to the genre. It is so manipulative, it leaves out a considerable amount of qualifying evidence, and it relies on a plethora of logical fallacies to promote its \"argument.\" I don't know if the filmmakers realize the damage they are doing to children and child welfare systems creating a film like this. This film is dangerous: it promotes the harming of children and sides with their abusers. They need to take an ethics course before they try making another \"documentary\".",

Not info on the medical side of things, I feel sorry for the health professionals if shite like this is legal to be produced. Please if you haven't already listen to the podcast about this form of child abuse. That said I wish my mum put me in a two week K-hole, YEW! Research people before you make judgement on the health system. If that was a parent beating up on their child your reviews would look very different.",

There is only so much to take before you have to hit pause. It is rare we can look into the eyes of pure evil, but it's important to see people lie with impunity just so you know what they are capable of. I would have like to know why these people were lying. What was on the back end for them? If they are evil wouldn't that also make them mentally ill or most certainly lying? Altering lives forever has to come with some consequence? This is all happening in a Florida hospital with the Johns Hopkins reputation. Mind numbing! FInal Score: 7/10",
