    "text": "This was an interesting movie. It used the basis of an actual true story. The director changed it up a bit. I think the acting was a bit lazy from the male lead. However, there wasn't a lot of dialog built up, either.\nCould they have used a younger looking cop for the story? Probably. The purpose of the story was to make you dislike him. He was supposed to come off scummy, so that worked to create a sense of unease from him. I really enjoyed the native folklore aspect and how it ended. It was more of what we wish would happen to the bad guy if this happened. The interviews were a bit unusual, but you get where it was going. For me, I understood it as a literal take on what normally happens in society when there is a fem victim where there isn't a good ending. All in all a decent movie. This is not a top dollar film but delivers a decent story line. It also does not give the ending away easily throughout the movie. The director appears to want the audience to be lured by the interviews. This is what happens in real life when there is a victim that is left for dead and the investigators seek to solve the mystery. However, there is no mystery as we see what happens with an unexpected ending. So, it is a little reality with a bit of vengeful fiction.",

    "text": "Poorly cast. Age difference kinda gross. The movie's pace is too fast to attach any sort of real suspense or attention to the plot. The guy literally screams \"If I can't have you, no one will.\" Ridiculous last-minute montage of some dream/story that somehow makes everyone wake up and realise the victim might be alive. Please. :( Ending was unsatisfying and a poor attempt to make the antagonist appear even more evil. The shock value twists wouldn't even be needed if the plot had moved effectively. Loosely based on a real life case, it was not given justice. Not great.",

    "text": "What a stupid film. True story yet ironic he stopped her from speeding yet that's how a year after the attack she died.. by speeding. Honestly a terrible film. It's flat and lacks any sort of energy and did I mention how bad the acting is? The lead girl clearly fancies herself and the others show such bottom level acting but you just don't get good points in the film it's just so boring. This script should have been so much better. Ah dear, shocker.",

He's still in jail thank God, however...sadly, 'Julie' , after a long hospital stay recovering from her gunshot wounds, was killed in a car accident a year later..I enjoyed the movie. I wish they had left the racial/bad white cop implications out. From my research. It has no bearing on the true story, and we truly don't need to throw gas on this fire.. plus the story didn't need it to be good.",
