There is no option here to give it a minus score. We kept thinking it'll get better and it never did. The finale was the most lack lustre, lazy, terrible ending to any film ever. Total RUBBISH!",

Dragged on forever waiting for some action. Acting was fine, plot was a complete let down. Hollywood pansies writing military mentality. The ending made absolutely no sense at all. Going within seconds from being hunted to the death by corrupt cops, to giving them escorts to the hospital. And that's where it ends. WTF!!!!",

    "text": "To be truthful i was very bored the entire movie.\nYou give it a chance and hope that somewhere in the middle there's gonna be a turn of events, a plot twist, something, but no. The movie is about a guy Terry who's trying to do the right thing by exposing the corrupted law enforcement in a small town. My thing is this, this is an action movie, but there was no action basically. Everything felt monotonish and like a drag. I liked the acting, the production was okay. Aaron Pierre was very impressively pulling out stunts and tricks during the fighting scenes, but it didn't saved the movie unfortunately. The movie was unnecessarily\nlong.",

I only hit play because it was recommended and Aaron Pierre\u2019s in it\u2014since he\u2019s gonna be Green Lantern soon, I was curious. Honestly, dude carries this movie. He\u2019s got that intensity and quiet strength that makes you go, yeah, this guy can be John Stewart. Also, super pleasant surprise seeing AnnaSophia Robb pop up\u2014she was one of my childhood crushes, so that was a little bonus.\n\nThe movie nails the \u201chate the cops from the jump\u201d vibe and really leans into the injustice theme. It\u2019s not the action-packed Netflix thrill ride they sold it as\u2014it\u2019s way more drama-thriller\u2014but the drama is so raw and believable it works. The acting across the board is excellent, and the impact is heavy. Only real knock? The pacing\u2019s a bit rough, could\u2019ve used tighter editing. Still, if they make a sequel, I\u2019m in.",

    "text": "Rebel Ridge is an intense Netflix thriller that delivers on action and spectacle. From the start, the film hooks the audience with sharp pacing and explosive sequences that rarely let up. The action scenes are executed with precision, creating the kind of pulse-pounding moments that keep viewers on the edge of their seat.\n\nWhile the story doesn\u2019t break new ground, the movie makes up for it with its sheer energy and captivating set pieces. The performances complement the high-octane tone, giving the audience someone to root for amid all the chaos.\n\nOverall, Rebel Ridge is an entertaining ride that proves Netflix can still churn out an adrenaline-filled crowd-pleaser. If you\u2019re in the mood for non-stop action and suspense, this film is worth the watch.",
