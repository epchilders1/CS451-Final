Good to see the non-LVMH side of France (athough there was one scene). Greatest day-off from prison. The French truly are America's best friend, odd friends at times. Maya was the true star of movie.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Matt Damon interpreta aqu\u00ed a un hombre rudo, de pocas palabras, que parece vivir a contracorriente del mundo que le rodea. Se embarca en un viaje hasta Francia para ayudar a su hija, implicada en un complicado proceso judicial. Podr\u00eda haber sido otro personaje plano, pero Damon le da peso, detalles y una contenci\u00f3n que lo hacen muy real.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula arranca como si fuera un thriller cl\u00e1sico, con un toque casi detectivesco, pero enseguida cambia el rumbo. Lo que parec\u00eda una investigaci\u00f3n termina convirti\u00e9ndose en un drama m\u00e1s \u00edntimo, centrado en las relaciones humanas y los silencios compartidos. Ese giro funciona a ratos, aunque tambi\u00e9n puede descolocar, porque el tono va dando bandazos y no siempre encaja todo con naturalidad.\n\nEl guion lanza temas potentes: la culpa, las barreras culturales, la necesidad de redenci\u00f3n, y c\u00f3mo los lazos familiares a veces se tensan hasta el l\u00edmite. El problema es que no siempre sabe manejar bien todo eso. Hay tramos que se alargan m\u00e1s de la cuenta y otros que se resuelven sin el desarrollo emocional que se espera.\n\nAun as\u00ed, hay momentos muy logrados, sobre todo cuando la historia se detiene en lo cotidiano. En esos fragmentos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os \u2014una conversaci\u00f3n, una mirada, un gesto\u2014 es donde la pel\u00edcula respira y convence. Camille Cottin brilla con sencillez, aportando naturalidad y ternura en su papel, y su relaci\u00f3n con Damon da lugar a algunas de las escenas m\u00e1s sinceras de la historia.\n\nA medida que avanza, la pel\u00edcula se aleja del thriller para volverse algo m\u00e1s personal. Quiere hablar de segundas oportunidades, de intentar entender al otro incluso cuando parece imposible. No todo funciona, pero hay una honestidad de fondo que se agradece. No ser\u00e1 perfecta, pero s\u00ed deja poso.\n\n(ENGLISH) Matt Damon plays a tough, quiet man who seems out of step with the world around him. He travels to France to help his daughter, who\u2019s caught up in a complicated legal case. This could\u2019ve been a flat, clich\u00e9 role, but Damon brings nuance, restraint, and realism to the character.\n\nThe film starts off like a straightforward thriller, almost like a procedural, but soon shifts direction. What begins as an investigation becomes a much more intimate story about human connections and unspoken pain. That change works in some scenes, but in others it feels jarring\u2014the tone wavers and not everything flows naturally.\n\nThe script brings up strong themes: guilt, cultural differences, the weight of family, the desire for redemption. But it doesn\u2019t always handle them well. Some parts drag, and others are rushed, leaving certain moments without the emotional impact they seem to aim for.\n\nStill, there are some really effective scenes, especially when the film slows down to focus on everyday life. It\u2019s in the quiet details\u2014a glance, a short exchange, a hesitant gesture\u2014where the story finds its emotional core. Camille Cottin brings warmth and honesty to her role, and her chemistry with Damon gives the film some of its most heartfelt moments.\n\nAs it moves forward, the movie steps away from being a thriller and turns into something more reflective. It\u2019s about second chances, about trying to understand people who feel completely foreign. It doesn\u2019t all land, but there\u2019s a sincerity running through it. Maybe it\u2019s not perfect\u2014but it does leave something behind.",

    "text": "Stillwater is an interesting character-driven story about a man searching for redemption in Marseilles, France. Matt Damon, being the excellent actor that he is, disappears into his role as  a homespun redneck from Oklahoma, and loses all of the trappings of his  elite background . I would have liked a deeper dive into Bill's psyche and  backstory ( more exposition, please) , but otherwise it is a solid story with a great cast. Recommended.",

Abigail's character is boring and so was her character in the Little Miss Sunshine \" movie. Trust me the \"thrill\" at the end is not worth your loss of 2 hours.  I had to Google the ending to see if I missed something....nope...those reviews are about like mine ... boring.",

As famous as Matt Damon is, all I kept seeing was a roughneck from Oklahoma, and thank goodness Damon did not overdo it. The little girl was superb. The daughter was almost too real.\n      The ending nicely tidied up things.",
