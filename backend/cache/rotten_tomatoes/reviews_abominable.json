    "text": "DreamWorks Animation steps outside the long shadow of its biggest competitors with Abominable, an unexpectedly charming and engaging adventure that proves animated storytelling doesn\u2019t need a Disney label to resonate. From its opening moments, the film pulls the audience into a story that mixes fantasy, warmth, and emotional sincerity, following a young girl who discovers a lost yeti and immediately forms a bond that becomes the heart of the entire narrative. What stands out is how naturally the film invests viewers in their journey, building characters and stakes without ever feeling forced or overly sentimental.\n\nThe premise is simple, even familiar, but DreamWorks elevates it with strong character work and visual inventiveness. Watching the friendship between the girl and the yeti develop not only adds heart but grounds the film\u2019s magical elements. The dynamic between them is consistently sweet and endearing, and the filmmakers lean into the theme of protecting what\u2019s vulnerable rather than exploiting it, giving the movie a sense of purpose that young audiences can appreciate.\n\nOne of the refreshing elements of Abominable is its approach to character design. Instead of defaulting to the typical animation mold\u2014where every human is impossibly slim, polished, and symmetrical\u2014the film presents characters with variety. Some are a little awkward, some are heavier, some lean into comedic quirks, and all of it contributes to the film feeling more human and relatable. It\u2019s a subtle but meaningful departure from the industry\u2019s usual standards and adds to its charm.\n\nWhat\u2019s unfortunate is that despite its strengths, Abominable has the kind of presence that slips from memory once the credits roll. The story works, the visuals impress, and the emotional beats land, yet the film occupies that odd space where it is wonderfully enjoyable in the moment but oddly easy to forget later. DreamWorks has classics permanently etched into the cultural landscape\u2014Shrek, Puss in Boots, How to Train Your Dragon\u2014and then there are titles like this one, where viewers find themselves saying, \"Oh yeah, that was DreamWorks too.\"\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t take away from how polished and lovingly crafted the movie is. The animation has a glowing softness to it, the world-building feels thoughtful, and the direction treats the story with genuine care. Action sequences, especially the chase moments, bring a surprising level of energy and imagination, making these scenes standouts that younger viewers will remember long after the story fades from their minds.\n\nIn the end, Abominable is a delightfully wholesome and visually enchanting family film that deserves more recognition than it gets. It may not carry the iconic status of DreamWorks\u2019 major franchises, but it offers sincere emotion, creativity, and a level of artistic quality that makes it well worth watching. Parents can feel confident putting it on for their kids, and even adults will find themselves swept up in its charm.",

    "text": "Abominable is a cute, safe playing animation. It has a good message and themes but keeps it at surface level. The animation is fluffy but there are a few beautiful visuals. The adventure is exciting without getting too harrowing and the characters are likeable enough with one or two being a tad grating. Definitely geared towards kids, but there is a bit adults can get out of it as well.",

Sure it may have some flaws like a bit of unoriginal side and some undeveloped characters (the villains), but despite those flaws, this is still a good film with a well crafted story, beautiful (and honestly some of the BEST animation I've seen and the best one from Dreamworks) and likeable characters (even if some of them took a long time to be likeable) Here's my rating:\nStory: 7/10\nAnimation: 10/10\nCharacters: 8/10\nOverall Score: 8/10 (Definitely Recommend It)",
