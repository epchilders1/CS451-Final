Even Deapool is just the Waiting character. I didnt believe him in character because I really see him as a  one note actor. I'd love to see him try and do a movie thats not that same character. Was a cute movie over all. Just disappointed in Reynolds.",

It's not doing anything new but the film has some exciting action scenes, some fun chemistry between Reynolds and Johnson and was just an all around good time. It's not gonna go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever and that's okay.",

    "text": "It's not bad. It's pretty solidly made all around. Reynolds & Johnson got good chemistry. Reminds me of Johnson with Statham in the F&F movies. The dialouge is pretty witty with some good jokes and very light hearted and self aware which helps. Gadot's even pretty good too and fun. It can still be a bit expose heavy at certain times with explaining things though. The fights ar fun, creative, and got a good mix of CGI & practical. Smetimes the CGI looks bad but it's used in creative ways. The directions pretty good and it's a colorful film to look at with lots of great locations to. It's filled with twists and turns and moves very fast the entire way. If there is one big strike here it's the plot. The plot makes perfect sense and isn't hard to follow. But it's so farfetched and reminds me of the Now You See Me movies where it really pushes the boundry of what is plausible and what isn't. So many plot twists that it almost takes you out of things unless you mindlessly just accept it. This is why it can be expose heavy because after every twist it has to stop and explain why the twist worked with either expose or Usual Suspects flashbacks. It's not easy to see it at all coming and there really isn't any signs. It's the only major strike that holds it back from being good. If they do do the sequel this baits than hopefully they streamline things a bit. It's a cool mix of adventure, action, and a heist thriller. It just needed to not get so convuluted and over the top with it's twists and turns. Anyone though who is a fan of any actors in this or the director may wanna check it out still. Or if want a unique heist adventure flick with some flaws.",

TheRock as a detective/policeman who can do everything and knows everything and who has contracts written in that he can't lose a fight kills everything that would matter in this movie if it were done right. Reyn Reynolds in his typical role as a pipsqueak is also incredibly obsolete.",

It\u2019s flashy, loud, and completely hollow. Sure, the sets are gorgeous and the stars are charming (and ridiculously attractive), but the plot? So predictable it hurts. I laughed, yes\u2014but more in disbelief than delight. It\u2019s the cinematic equivalent of junk food: mildly satisfying in the moment, instantly forgettable, and somehow still teasing a sequel. Disappointed, amused, and slightly annoyed\u2014I guess that\u2019s entertainment now.",
