Pamela\u2019s journey through public scandals, cruel punchlines, failed marriages and heartbreaks show a resilience that\u2019s rare in Hollywood. She remained kind, humble, and soft at heart. She\u2019s proof that grace can outshine gossip. I\u2019ve never been this happy to see someone finally get the win they truly deserve. My biggest takeaway? Her sons\u2019 deep respect and love for her. Proof that she\u2019s won in all the ways that truly matter.",

    "text": "\"Pamela, a Love Story\" sets the record straight on a plethora of misconceptions during an unforgiving and narrow-minded time via Pamela's own strength and voice. She openly offers the ins and outs of her life with a welcome sense of vulnerability yet lightness, following an individual who's been through a heck of a lot, is dealing with it and somehow comes out on top through her determination and drive. A real, genuine look into a misunderstood icon's story - teaching all of us to never judge a book by its cover.",

    "text": "Pamela is one of many bio-pic films or short series to come out this year. I get a vibe of truth and honesty to the narrative from Pamela. There is obviously a need to control the narrative, which we all feel. But we mostly just get Pamela, her story, from her perspective, and that is compelling. Tommy Lee would need to give his own perspective, and he seems contrite. I really respect Pamela's strength to hold to her own resolve. I wish she'd been strong enough as a youth - it's daunting to think of the people that sought to influence her as a teen to their own profit. \n\nShe has a positive soul that seeks love, and it's tragic to feel that her love belongs to someone who hurt her.\n\nBottom line, money doesn't solve emotional issues.",

    "text": "Pamela, A Love Story - 10/10. What a wonderful surprise of a documentary this was! Pamela, A Love Story chronicles the life of Pamela, told from her perspective. And it makes me think about how much this lovely and warm individual had to go through. She had dreams and wants in life, but sadly couldn't do all of what she wanted due to the caricaturing of her personal life. You can tell from her pain and stories that she has gone through so much. But even through that pain and sorrow, she still has a smile and jovial energy to her. She is such a great person, as you can tell by her activism, writing, love of love, and overall demeanour. She deserves the world, and I hope people watch this doc and change their view of her and see the great person she really is!",

I kept waiting (based on the ratings) for the show or Pamela to reveal something other than what I already knew. I guess that's 120 minutes I can't get back.",

It's so interesting hearing about her life and it's a very good watch. I feel so sorry for all she's been through. She's an inspiring, strong lady and should be proud of herself. Life has dealt her some blows, yet she carries on. Truly inspirational.",

    "text": "\"Pamela:  A Love Story\" is a well made documentary on the turbulent life of Pamela Anderson.  The interviews featured in the documentary are well done and are rather informative.  What I liked about the documentary is it gave the viewer a look at some of the major events in Pamela Anderson's life from her perspective.  The most prominent moment would the theft of the infamous sex tape and the consequences that caused.  As I am sure you know, once the tape became public rumors started to fly saying Pamela and her then husband Tommy Lee intentionally released the tape to the public for publicity reasons.  The documentary offers strong evidence to show that is false.  In my opinion the best evidence is the fact that the late Bob Guccione offered Pamela and Tommy $5 million in cash for the rights to the tape which they declined.  Another highlight for me is the footage of Pamela rehearsing for the role of Roxy Hart in the Broadway revival of \"Chicago\".   A very fitting way to end the documentary.  \"Pamela:  A Love Story\" is one of the better documentaries I have seen recently.  I highly recommend it.",
