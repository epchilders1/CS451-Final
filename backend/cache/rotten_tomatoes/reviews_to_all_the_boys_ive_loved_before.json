There were a few instances with good plot movement, but there were too many long drawn out scenes of casual conversation that do not move the plot along. Had high hopes with the good reviews but left disappointed. Would recommend avoiding.",

Honestly, It\u2019s one of the best films I\u2019ve ever seen,I found this movie funny and emotive,if you are someone who loves romance it\u2019s a perfect movie for you,there are many parts (To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before 1, To All the Boys I've Loved Before 2 and To All the Boys I've Loved Before 3) so if you liked the first part you can see the others ones.",

    "text": "To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a rom-com that has been hugely successful and watched by many teenagers all over the world. I watched it when I was fifteen years old and, sometimes, I still watch it in my free time. \n\nThe plot and the mood of the movie is extremely sweet and romantic. The acting from the principal actors is really touching. When you watch the movie, you will feel happy, sad, betrayed and romantic. \n\nThe feeling that the characters have will be felt by you too. If I can talk about my favorite character, it is Kitty, the little sister. She's really funny and maybe, somewhat overconfident. However, without her, Lara-Jean would not have been with her lover, so I think Kitty has an important place on the movie.\n\nIf you are a person who likes all the romantic stuff that we dream of, I highly recommended seeing this beautiful movie.",

It had a great soundtrack and I really like the Covey family dynamic (not a toxic family). Lana Condor and Anna Cathcart\u2019s delivery is so unique and great.",

It might bother some watchers, but I liked the fact that it is easy to realize the movie is a book adaptation by how much time characters spend just talking. Most book adaptations cut off the considerly boring part of converstation and leave just the action, which most of the time kills the whole plot and point of the story. As someone who usually watches only 2000s \nrom-coms, mostly classics, because Netflix kind of forgot how to make good shows, yet I fell in love with this movie. Definitely Worth watching!",
