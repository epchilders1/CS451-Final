I liked how they switched it up having all the victors play in the Hunger Games but I don't care about the campaigning.",

    "text": "\u201cThe Dark Knight of the Hunger Games franchise. This is some Empire Strikes Back level of film with so much underlying themes about grief/loss, struggles/survival all being presented as entertainment for those cheering on the ruthlessness of the games and for us at home, who want to see all the survivors win - in particular, Katniss Everdeen, a very convincing, Oscar-Worthy, career defining Jennifer Lawrence who channels every single human emotion on screen of someone who is completely emotionally and mentally distraught by the circumstances she found herself in but has no other choice then to stay and fight. \n\nFrom indifference to horror shock to helplessness - as her character navigates through stress, PTSD/survivor\u2019s guilt and grief - and finally the internal and external rage that courses through in her expressions and body movements. You are watching a professional. \n\nEverything is heightened here. The other supporting characters are at their A game even Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson are fleshing out their characters nicely. This is a film about trying and standing defiantly against all odds no matter how daunting it is or how high the climb may be.",
