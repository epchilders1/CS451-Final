I really enjoyed the game back then, and I'm very glad that David Sandberg's version isn't a direct adaptation of the game, but rather takes place in the same universe as (presumably) all the \"Dark Pictures\" games. Creative ideas, good effects, and a likeable cast make for entertaining viewing. However, the very shallow script and the lack of genuine horror for me unfortunately prevent \"Until Dawn\" from rising above mediocrity. It's watchable, but there are many far worse video game adaptations.",

    "text": "Having only played Until Dawn for the first time earlier this year, thoroughly loving it and still amazed I managed to keep everyone alive on my first playthrough, I was very reserved about what this adaptation in name only would bring to the table. While it attempts to blend multiple horror subgenres into a single blood-soaked narrative, the lack of inspiration in each new variation yields a spoil of diminishing returns, spinning its wheels and becoming more tired with each cycle, leaving a solid premise dead on its feet. Unlike the source material, the film doesn't successfully unite various flavours of onscreen terror as much as it haphazardly smashes them together through a cast of bland, hapless Gen Z mincemeat. I am glad that they at least kept Peter Stormare from the game, as he was a more than welcoming presence. What I can't abide by is the lack of any of the other game's cast of characters, including Emily, my beloved. The under-lit and depressingly flat photography combined with a weak and disposable script do not gel with David F. Sandberg's relatively ambitious direction, the impressive practical effects, a serviceable score by Benjamin Wallfisch and some occasional bursts of fun. All the potential Until Dawn might have had is frustratingly squandered, but, on its own, lower-stakes terms, it's a passable, if rather unfrightening, experience, dispensing clich\u00e9s that are as mouldy as the haunted house in which its characters are confined. Had it been called literally anything other than its namesake, maybe I would have been kinder to it; otherwise, it's a Wendi-no from me.",

Clover\u2019s sister Mel got lost, we see how she misses her but we don\u2019t get to feel it, there wasn\u2019t enough scenes when we truly get to see how close they were. Also, their mom has d*ed but we never get to know how. There\u2019s more, Clover and Max are ex lovers. If that wasn\u2019t mentioned that one time you couldn\u2019t tell that they were together. Nina & Abe are in the relationship, it wasn\u2019t believable. The movie and acting in general was flat. The biggest plot hole is that we don\u2019t know nothing about that evil doctor, like how we even discovered that magical hourglass and where did it came from\u2026 Questions that need answers.",

Overall, it\u2019s a shallow film that delivers a lackluster execution of what could have been an interesting concept.",

But all the good will it built in the first half hour goes to become surprising at first and pretty soon increasingly stupid and banal at the point that you feel that anything goes. As a result you just lose all interest, turning a promising start in the realization that this is just disposable youth entertainment at best.",
