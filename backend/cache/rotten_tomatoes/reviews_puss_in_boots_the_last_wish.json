Amazing themes. Amazing characters. Amazing story. Amazing comedy. Surprisingly deep. There are even some horror elements, with the whole Death thing - just chills! The better Puss in Boots movie, you can even skip 1 if you want, it won't hurt your experience.",

With Antonio Banderas back in top form, dazzling painterly animation, and a chilling villain in Death, the film mixes adventure and heart with rare finesse. Funny, moving, and gorgeous to look at, it\u2019s one of DreamWorks\u2019 very best.",

Awesome movie. Highly recommend!!!",
