    "text": "I can't understand that it took me such a long time to finally watch this movie.  I guess it just escaped me because the title in Portuguese is identical to another older movie which I simply didn't care to watch again. Thus said, I finally had the chance and I was flabbergasted. It's a masterpiece which leaves everything pretty open till very close to the end, and even then it has a surprise up its sleeves. Though it starts out like so many other court cases, it is in fact a thriller about how to manipulate one and illegally force the decision one way or the other. Gene and John are just perfect, and the ending is way better than one could ever imagine. 8/10 points!",

    "text": "Runaway Jury has a solid amount of courtroom suspense and the premise is interesting. The cast is great and there are some great performances across the board, particularly from John Cusack.\n\nThere were a lot of characters that seemed underutilized (i.e., the opposing attorney, the jury consultant for the plaintiff, etc.). The twist was strong and I enjoyed the end of the film, but there were a few loose ends I would have liked buttoned up (Marlee's mom).\n\nBest Character: Nicholas Easter\nBest Quote: \"If you're relying on testimony to win this case, you've already lost it.

Not bad to have a good screenplay writer adapt a good writer\u2019s book.\n\nCast was great, acting just ok.  Maybe just rushed, I\u2019m not sure.  Directing and producing not strong.",

    "text": "3.5 stars; I really love John Grisham's books (should have been a lawyer). For the most part, the movies captured the spirit of his books, as was the case with \"Runaway Jury.\" For its time, it introduced all the sophisticated technology that went into jury selection for most successful lawyers. Director Gary Fleder converted the story into an action-suspense movie, for the most part successfully. I guess the biggest complaint about the movie was that, for an all-star cast, the acting effort did not satisfy. Up to a point, I can agree with that. However, that did not detract from the suspense that was generated. The technology, while somewhat dated by today's standards, was pretty awesome for the early 2000s. I enjoyed it!",

I did like how the film was political. That was captured well. Overall, the film was good. The film could have been better had it focused more on Hoffman and Hackman characters.",

    "text": "I watched this movie in hearing about the passing of Gene Hackman.  I stopped watching John Grisham movies after being disappointed by the film version of The Firm.   This one has an all star cast and is very good.  Hackman is really good, as always.    John Cusack does a great job as the suave and manipulative juror with an agenda.   Dustin Hoffman is not his best, but good, as the honest, country lawyer seeking justice for a gun death client's family.  This one varies from the book, but I never read the book, so I am not jaded.   The story is unrealistic but it doesn't matter.   This is a good courtroom, and behind the scenes, drama.",
