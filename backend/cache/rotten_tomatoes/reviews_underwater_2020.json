    "text": "Derivative, but entertaining deep-sea ALIEN clone\nUnderwater (2020) ***1/2\n\nDeep-sea drilling rig workers must escape after an earthquake wrecks their facility, but soon find out they are not alone at the bottom of the ocean. UNDERWATER does not have an original bone in its body, but it\u2019s a pretty darn entertaining underwater version of ALIEN (and it\u2019s many subsequent knockoffs). LEVIATHAN and DEEP STAR SIX were two other underwater ALIEN knockoffs back in the day (I don\u2019t count THE ABYSS. That one is more CLOSE ENCOUNTERS than ALIEN), but UNDERWATER is superior to either of those underwater monster movies. The filmmakers here are pretty open in acknowledging their forebearers, right down to the opening credits font, to a fun chest-buster callback, and even Stewart and crew walking around in their underwear at the end of the film (though it\u2019s black underwear instead of white). I\u2019m also pretty sure I saw a Weyland Corporation logo pop up on a computer boot screen early on in the film. While the setup is pretty derivative, it does go to some unexpected places by the film's ending, which was fun, but I did find the ending too CGI-heavy and basically became a meh Marvel movie with the overuse of CGI, which took me out of the movie. The film worked much better when the CGI monsters were only fleetingly seen moving through the murky waters, compared to when you later clearly see them in their full CGI lameness. Just as with JAWS, less is more when it comes to how much you show the monster. There is one scene where there\u2019s a small practical effects puppet monster during a medical bay examination scene straight out of Ian Holm examining the facehugger in the original ALIEN, which is pretty fun. Also not so good is when the film does try to hit some emotional character beats, you can tell those scenes should have had an emotional resonance that was noticeably absent. I couldn\u2019t help but recall the far more effective scenes in James Cameron\u2019s THE ABYSS, a film that delivered both carefully drawn, fully developed characters and also some top-tier action and suspense. While this film is nowhere near up to those standards, with a threadbare story and characterization, the film is essentially wall-to-wall action, so you never really have time to get bored, making it easier to gloss over its deficits. The plot boils down to the deep-sea workers needing to cross the ocean floor for over a mile to some emergency escape pods. A particularly strong cast carries the bare-bones story, with Kristen Stewart, as the Ellen Ripley figure, doing the yeoman\u2019s work of most of the film\u2019s heavy lifting. Per usual, she\u2019s effortlessly cool, and the audience immediately goes along with her character\u2019s undersea survival horror journey. You also get Vincent Cassel (IRREVERSIBLE, BLACK SWAN) as the undersea captain working hard to keep his crew alive, but it\u2019s TJ Miller (SILICON VALLEY) who steals every scene he\u2019s in, including right off the bat when Stewart pulls him free from earthquake rubble and he thanks her by saying, \"You sweet, flat-chested elven creature!\" That sounds like a Miller, a former standup, ad lib. Overall, UNDERWATER is thin on characterization and story, and is wildly derivative, but the cast and the non-stop action and suspense are enough to keep fans of these sorts of films entertained. FUN FACT! The underwater scenes were actually shot on dry sets, and CGI water debris was added later. It works surprisingly well, especially compared to the lame CGI monsters.\u00a0\n\nAI CAPSULE REVIEW: \nUnderwater is a blatantly derivative but brisk and entertaining deep-sea riff on Alien, elevated by a strong cast\u2014especially Kristen Stewart\u2014and nearly nonstop tension. Its murky, restrained early monster work is far more effective than the CGI-heavy finale, which dulls the impact. Still, for fans of creature thrillers, it delivers solid, fast-paced fun.",

A hobby of mine is watching horror movies and trying to decipher what the monster is and study it but this movie deprived me of that pleasure, and the destruction of the \"queen\" and the death of the main character, Norah, leads me to believe that a sequel is unlikely leaving my questions unanswered.",

    "text": "A good monster movie with quality acting, action throughout and atmospheric cinematography. A few moments of really great suspense, creepy monsters, and a spooky underwater setting definitely make it worth watching. It is, unfortunately, bogged down by a way too on-the-nose script that doesn\u2019t seem to trust the viewer to make inferences or interpretations.",

Solid effort from Stewart and Cassel is great as always. A bit of anticlimactic ending but it's still an enjoyable ride if you're a fan of the genre.",

But she did a great job in this movie. She shined. And the movie itself was really good. When it ends and you want a sequel, that\u2019s a good movie. The script was excellent too: if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, any road will get you there. T.J. Hooker shined in this movie too.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Underwater no se sale del molde. Desde el primer minuto sabes exactamente lo que vas a ver: un grupo de personajes atrapados en una instalaci\u00f3n submarina, una amenaza que los va eliminando uno a uno y la lucha desesperada por sobrevivir. La pel\u00edcula no pierde el tiempo con introducciones innecesarias y va directo a la acci\u00f3n, pero esa misma prisa le juega en contra, porque los personajes apenas tienen desarrollo. Kristen Stewart hace lo que puede con su papel, aportando intensidad y presencia, pero la historia no le da mucho con qu\u00e9 trabajar.\n\nEl mayor problema es que todo resulta demasiado familiar. Underwater bebe sin disimulo de pel\u00edculas como Alien, Abyss o Leviathan, pero sin aportar nada nuevo. Hay tensi\u00f3n, s\u00ed, y algunas escenas funcionan gracias a su ambientaci\u00f3n claustrof\u00f3bica y los efectos especiales bien logrados, pero la sensaci\u00f3n de \"esto ya lo he visto\" pesa demasiado. Adem\u00e1s, la acci\u00f3n a veces es confusa, con secuencias oscuras y un montaje que dificulta seguir lo que est\u00e1 pasando.\n\nEn definitiva, Underwater es una pel\u00edcula entretenida, pero poco memorable. Si te gustan los thrillers de supervivencia con monstruos y no te importa que sigan la misma f\u00f3rmula de siempre, puede ofrecerte un rato de tensi\u00f3n y algunos buenos momentos visuales. Pero si buscas algo m\u00e1s original o con personajes que realmente importen, esta no es la inmersi\u00f3n que necesitas.\n\n(ENGLISH) Underwater doesn\u2019t break any new ground. From the very first minute, you know exactly what you\u2019re in for: a group of characters trapped in an underwater facility, a mysterious threat picking them off one by one, and a desperate fight for survival. The film wastes no time on unnecessary introductions and jumps straight into the action, but that same rush works against it\u2014there\u2019s barely any character development. Kristen Stewart does what she can with her role, bringing intensity and presence, but the story doesn\u2019t give her much to work with.\n\nThe biggest issue is how familiar everything feels. Underwater borrows shamelessly from films like Alien, The Abyss, and Leviathan without adding anything new. There\u2019s tension, sure, and some sequences work thanks to the claustrophobic setting and well-executed special effects, but the overwhelming sense of \"I\u2019ve seen this before\" is hard to ignore. The action can also be hard to follow at times, with dim lighting and frantic editing that make it difficult to see what\u2019s happening.\n\nIn the end, Underwater is an entertaining but forgettable experience. If you enjoy survival thrillers with sea monsters and don\u2019t mind a formulaic approach, it delivers some tension and solid visuals. But if you\u2019re looking for something more original or characters that truly matter, this might not be the deep dive you\u2019re looking for.",
