Everything about the movie is one huge clich\u00e9 after another - from the plot, characters and fight scenes to the very end. This feels like a movie from IKEA, they got the parts and used a well-known blueprint to put it together and yeah, now it exists but it looks like every other movie you've seen.",

    "text": "Rebel moon won an admirable Skidmark award for the most clich\u00e9s ever compressed into a single movie, and the 3.5 hour Director's Cut wowed audiences with an award-winning 342,048 clich\u00e9s and totally implausible scenes. Charlie Hunnam's frankly rectal impersonation of an Irish accent won him a Barfta award for Most Implausible Accent, and the scriptwriters were sent straight to hell where they are suffering eternal torture and damnation at the hands of all that is holy and good. If anyone suggests watching Rebel Moon for a fun night in, run immediately out to the desert, remove your eyeballs with a rusty spoon and fornicate your eye sockets with a cactus. It will be considerably more fun than watching literally every Hollywood clich\u00e9 of all time jammed into this total mess of a movie.",

Just borrowed trope after borrowed trope. Charlie Hunnam and Sofia Boutella\u2019s exchange after he captures them felt like a high school kid wrote it. V painful.",

I can see that a heavily edited version might not work.  Perhaps this may be one of those films that becomes more favored with time but as long as it was, I did not feel like I wasted my time watching it.  Indeed, I'm glad I gave it a try before reading all the negative reviews.",

The background worldbuilding is genuinely interesting... and also totally unexplored. In all other respects, it is an incoherent, hollow, poorly paced and poorly edited mess.\n\nThe dialogue and character writing is atrocious and there is zero chemistry between ay of the characters. They are all one-note, shallow, derivative caricatures. And the film *drags* with so many excruciatingly, unnecessarily long scenes where absolutely nothing happens. Things frequently happen for no reason other than to drive the plot, even where they make no sense. \n\nRedeeming factors are Atticus Noble as the bad guy, & Anthony Hopkins as the robot. The spaceships looks amazing, the sci-fi elements are genuinely interesting - unfortunately, the entire film takes place in the countryside, so we don't really get to explore any of that. \n\nGenuinely one of the worst films I have ever seen, and part 2 is even worse.",
