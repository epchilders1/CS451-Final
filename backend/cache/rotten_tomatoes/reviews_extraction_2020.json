Who watches an action movie for plot??? I want fun, death and spectacle. This movie has all 3 in spades. Hemsworth could be the next Stallone (Yes that's a compliment) if he wasn't busy spending more time with family and being a great guy in general.",

Golshifteh Farahani leads the team and puts in work and is a total badass. Rudhraksh Jaiswal was very good as well, he performed better then alot of the mainstream actors today. \n\nBody count is high, and you have to take it like a good ol shoot em up movie. Fight seens are great and the car chase seens were great.",

This action thriller is a categorical guarantee on entertaining proportions with enough adrenaline to boost past the genre\u2019s decent genericities through agreeably spectacular sequences and Hemsworth at his probable peaked form, persuasively imprinting anticipation for more after lingering with an impressive note to further deviate from the genre\u2019s troublesome repetition.

Tyler struggles and sacrifices a lot to make sure his goals are met, which can\u2019t be said for a lot of action movies, where the protagonist is overpowered and indestructible. The only thing that takes away from Extraction is the CGI, which probably would have fit seamlessly into the movie if it just had a bit more work done to it. Nevertheless, this film is worth a watch.",
