The action scenes that are supposed to feel climactic often feel quite cheap instead, this film is very much a victim of a low budget. Now that I've watched this film once I won't watch it a second time.",

    "text": "Agree with comments of reviewers 2 star or less who articulate fairly well my thoughts. Mediocre action movie with predictable plot.  Ridiculous gunplay.  Protagonist with a pistol takes out dozens with automatic rifles, who stand out in the open (as does the protagonist).  Action scenes predictable, as was the script, although some of the fight choreography was athletic.",

Matt Goss should be good, but I cannot take him seriously in this and the dialogue is embarrassing. Badly written, some terrible acting and poor direction.",

Bartender born and raised in Slovakia then moved to Romania but has no accent. An American spy driving around Romania in a Mustang with New York plates? Whatever happened with attention to details\u2026certainly not the director or the writers. Did the actors need a payday or something?",

Then it just enters the first curve too hot, blasts through the guardrail and tumbles 1000 yards down a rocky embankment. 15 minutes in, I deemed it unwatchable. DNF\n\nAnd in that first 15 min you'll get treated to terrible acting/directing, wearisome dialogue and musical score choices that make zero sense. Production quality is third-rate. MJW deserves better vehicles.",

I mean for gosh sakes Arnold made his mark doing this kind of stuff, although admittedly in better vehicles.  And the fight scenes are pretty good.  But otherwise, this thing is like a mid tier Adkins flick.",

    "text": "Michael Jai White and Luke Gross star in the straight-to-video action-thriller The Hard Way.  When his brother is killed in Romania investigating a local crime boss, John Payne picks up where he left off, intent on getting revenge.  Both White and Gross do an excellent job handling the fight choreography, delivering some great moves.  However, the plot is extremely formulaic and is full of the usually tropes and clich\u00e9s; stripper girlfriends, hidden USB drives, secret identities, etc.  And the low-budget shows in the scaled down cast and limited locations.  Still, for what it is, The Hard way is an entertaining action film that delivers some thrills.",

    "text": "This movie definitely has a leading duo that can really do stunts and fight scenes, but that's pretty much it. The acting is really clanky and the plot is very generic and predictable, and the CGI, when shown, is absolutely horrible. This movie is the same January action movie you've seen 10 million times over and over again. As I mentioned before, the cast can very well perform stunts, but the action sequences are sometimes filmed with hand held cam, which really takes away from the stunt work and choreography, which can be laughable at times. I laughed a lot while watching this movie, of course, where I wasn't supposed to. The opening 20 mintues are badass enough to make me sit through this entire thing. That's the one of the few redeeming qualities of this movie.",

It had a promising start, and a solid ending, but not a lot worthwhile in between. Still, a lot better than the past few things I've seen Luke Goss in.",

Some of the shots don\u2019t even make sense, the action was mildly entertaining but I must reiterate how bad the acting actually is. The only was this movie can be considered good is if it\u2019s a parade of some other action move I\u2019ve never seen.",

Characters sucked, plot sucked, nothing was real and the only decent factor was Michael Jai Whites powerful asskicking. It was so unrealistic and lopsided that he did not take even one punch until the end of the film in the last scene. How was this film made? Why? Why Netflix? Why?",
