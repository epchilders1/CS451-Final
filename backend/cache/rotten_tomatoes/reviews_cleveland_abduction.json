This true story about the abduction of Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus, and Amanda Berry was dark, dramatic, and traumatizing. What Ariel Castro did to these women was just downright evil. These women didn't deserve to have their lives taken away. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",

I would recommend it to anyone. \nand PS- for him to hang himself one month into his life sentence really shows that he couldn't handle the life he gave those girls. Locked in a cell and tormented was too much for him; but im happy all 3 of those girls came out alive and strong.",

I did not like how it was only based on Michelle's perspective. It would of been a million times better if they told all three girls stories not just one of them. I also thought the movie was way too short, they suffered for 11-10 years the movie should have been longer in order to fully tell their tragic story.  Seriously disappointed!",
