    "text": "Jaw dropping, literally. \n\nThis is more than the documentation of a massive tornado.  It brings all the elements of small town simplicity, a religious prophecy met with shocking accuracy, and young people filled with hope of the future/juxtapose a tragedy on par with the actual prediction of their town\u2019s Armageddon. I love that the film focuses on the youth\u2019s experience of it, as it portraits all the hope and innocence of that time in life, and how profoundly it shapes them, after enduring it.  \n\nAlso I thought the actual real time footage and the created content, seemed to blend seamlessly, and the backdrop music added the perfect element of awesome, and eerie.  \n\nTruly surprised by this one. Don\u2019t overthink it. Just enjoy, and be glad it\u2019s not you.",

    "text": "The visual effects led my right brain to enjoy the cinema. Like the original Twister, the storms and their effects were excellently portrayed. But the perforated plot and overall storyline left me unsatiated. Tragedy during the first act was predictable, based on the original Twiser. But the obligatory romance between the lead characters was both too rapidly initiated and ultimately unfulfilled in the final act. Bologna was sandwiched between the two and seasoned with schmalz and hollow altruism. For those reasons, I nominate the storm as the best actor in the film.",

I hoped to see more footage of the tornado, more on the aftermath of the destruction, some aerial footage before and after, maybe a couple survivor stories. It was difficult to tell what was actual footage and what wasn't. I was disappointed.",

If this is the result of climate change, make a documentary that has information to support that viewpoint.  Intellectually lazy.  And dishonest seeing as though it\u2019s not part of the advertisement, I was part of a captured audience at that point.",

Seeing those first hand accounts and the devastating after effects really leaves an impression. It was tough to see some of the footage due to my own fear of tornadoes. The only thing I can say critically is I wish there were more eyewitness accounts thrown in. Regardless it was a fantastic documentary and my heart goes out to everyone in Joplin and all of those to assisted in the recovery and clean up. \ud83d\ude4f",

    "text": "The Twister: Caught In The Storm - 10/10. Netflix docs are really hit and miss these days, but this is a reminder that Netflix was (and still is in a sense) a good source for incredible content. The Twister is a perfect example of a documentary that shows the impact of a natural disaster on regular folk. Its easy for us to glance over the impact or magnitude of something due to the popularity of a movie or series that involves natural disasters. Heck, I\u2019m a huge fan of the Twister films and natural disaster movies in general, and this doc reminded me that the entertainment we get from those visuals are nightmares for others. This is based around a category 5 twister that hit in 2011, and the impact it had on the graduating class of Joplin. Through interviews, retrospective news, and live footage from the scenes, this doc shows you that the \u201cend of days\u201d situation that these people went through is no joke whatsoever. The doc does an amazing job of showing how scary and how frightening it might have been if you were there at the time. Its scary to see how big and how damaging this twister is. You see all these people who look back at the event and tell it with grief and pain. And when you see the storm chasing footage, it really gives a shiver down your spine as to how huge the twister is. This felt really impactful from the start to finish, and it makes you remember that nature is nothing to be messed with.",
