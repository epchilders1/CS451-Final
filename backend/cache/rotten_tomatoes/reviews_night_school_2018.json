    "text": "One thing that is left in my mind after watching this movie is that there's nothing like I'm too old for anything. You can pursue your dreams even after you retired. The movie is mainly about a man who dropped out of school due to the difficulties he has when studying. However, he have a successful career of selling barbecue grills and a hot girlfriend. Even so, an explosion from the grill when he proposed his girlfriend lead him to the lost of his shop. He found a new job which is perfect for him. Since the company wouldn't accept him if he didn't pass the GED, he had no choice but to go to school and take the GED test. He joined the night school and his study partners were all the people who decided to retake the GED exam at certain ages. The movie continues to show how they passed the exam and how the lead actor didn't give up till he passed. This movie contains different kind of genres like comedy, drama and romance. It would have been a family movie without the sexual related jokes. Definitely a great movie but not much a fan of it.",

    "text": "Night School movie is a pretty good comedy movie but there is a lot of sexual talks. So it will not be able to watch kids under 14. Kevin is a successful worker at BBQ restaurant. He get a good amount of salary because of his marketing skills. At the start of the movie, an unfortunate accident happened at Kevin while he was proposing his girlfriend megalyn. As Kevin lose his job, he had to attend the school to get GED. He attended at the Night School class that was teached by Tiffany. The movie got comedy, romance, hardworking. Kevin knew that he has dyslexia while he was attending night school. Tiffany and Kevin try so hard to get Kevin GED. At the last Kevin got GED and he was having a happily life again. This is a pretty nice movie for people who is trying to give up. I recommend to watch this movie while you are chilling but not recommend for kids who are under 14. You can see how Kevin try to get GED and you all wish to have a teacher like Tiffany.",
