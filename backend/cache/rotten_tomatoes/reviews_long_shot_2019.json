    "text": "Starts as a very simple rom com , meet cute and developing relationship, but descends into a drug fuelled farce , not sure exactly what message it\u2019s trying to get out there but it\u2019s not a message I endorse . An intelligent female Secretary of State descends into the state of an adolescent idiocy when she hooks up with an old friend and starts living the misspent youth she never had , thereby jeopardising her chances of becoming the next president , not sure exactly what the audience is meant to extrapolate from that , but this audience member didn\u2019t like it at all , is the message women will do anything for a relationship, they are so desperate for affection ? Because that\u2019s the only \u201c meaning \u201c I could find , oh and by the way it gets pretty gross at times too . No wonder this bombed , despite an excellent cast .",

    "text": "\"Long Shot\" is the perfect mix of humour and heart making it an ideal way to wind down your Thursday. Theron is effortlessly classy and gorgeous as the Secretary of State, while Rogen, in his usual hilariously unfiltered style, delivers a performance that's both relatable and genuinely funny. His humor feels natural, making every scene he's in a thrill to watch.\n\nWhile the story doesn't reinvent the genre, its charm lies in depicting two wildly different characters, one polished - the other chaotic, finding common ground.\n\nThe film has beautiful visuals that take you around the world and brisk pacing that keeps it engaging. An unexpected action sequence midway adds an energetic twist, while the nostalgic tone brings heart to the comedy, grounding the film in genuine emotions. \"Long Shot\" is sweet, witty, and effortlessly entertaining.",

Chalk full of grown up 90s humor and subtle jokes that never warrant an outloud laugh but still make you feel like you are a fly on the wall of a blossoming relationship and in that sense, are perfect.  There are some parts that are absolutely hilarious and well delivered and other parts that are ridiculously unrealistic that it lets us know that this film doesn't take itself too seriously and the writers and actors aren't afraid to have fun.",

A few laughs but overall a movie that disappointed, and proved that movies are still made without reason and we walk like lambs towards them. This lamb is very disappointed. Go watch Dave.  A great movie with a similar ridiculous plot set up that aims high.",
