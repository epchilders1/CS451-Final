    "text": "In the history of cinema, a sequel must feel as genuine as the first film. Else this would cause huge complications. Well, I feel sad for DreamWorks because the Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate is a sequel that was entirely ruined. This is likely due to the choppy animation style and the rushed planning, leading to a direct-to-video television animated film. Strange name right?\nLet's just say DreamWorks wanted to keep the budget silent enough, because they knew it was not going to work. So they distributed the film primarily through Peacock, which supports the direct-to-video television production. This is a red flag that tells you the movie is not worth it. But anyways, the visual style looks like DreamWorks evolved backwards for a bit. The first Megamind had clear visuals, realistic textures, professional rendering and sound creation, and supported the stereoscopic 3D viewing format to push the limits of cinema. The animation had feeling, just like Pixar, and wasn't a cashgrab. The second one, once the trailer was seen, felt choppy, cringe, full of animation glitches, unrealistic like it was a decade ago, and was rigged by streaming platforms. This is what happens when the direction isn't interested in the movie, leading DreamWorks employees to disrupt the entire project. I feel dissapointed about one of my animation companies when they fumble a sequel to a successful movie.\nP. S. You should've brung Metroman to do the arm swings too",
