Very touching.",

Bill Paxton did an awesome job narrating the film. James Cameron also did a great job directing the movie. I enjoyed it because of my interest in this magnificent ship.",

    "text": "Ghosts of The Abyss is an interesting continuation of James Cameron's exploration of the Titanic wreckage. Complete with Bill Paxton, this documentary feels like it would have been better suited as a special feature to compliment the 1997 movie. Although it's a bit lackluster for a feature film, it is a fascinating viewing experience. Many of the shots are breathtaking, especially when superimposed with CGI images of the original ship and passengers. There's a surreal feeling to this film, as the dates of this exploration overlapped with the events of September 11th, 2001. As the crew was focused on this historic tragedy, another one was taking place. I enjoyed this for what it is, but I can't give it a very high rating. Sadly, there's just not a whole lot to it.",

    "text": "The emotional effects of the tragedy still remains like the wreck, but Cameron's journey to the real setting of his so-called masterpiece managed to be better than \"Titanic\" (as I expected it to be) because of the amazing (and sometimes somewhat creepy) underwater visuals and adding scenes of the ship's old days, serving as a prequel, sequel and remake.

Es interesante la verdad, pero en ciertas partes llega aburrir, ya que aveces en vez de enfocarse en el barco, se pierde el tiempo en otra cosa. Pero es, o bueno fue un buen documental ya que Cameron lo hizo con \"Titanic: Los \u00daltimos Misterios\"- Discovery Channel (2005) y \"Titanic: la Ultima Palabra\"- NATGEO (2012). Aun as\u00ed, la forma en como Bill Paxton y el resto del equipo narran la historia del barco, compensan ciertos fallos. Aunque claro, con los nuevos descubrimientos, el documental ya no estas exacto en la forma de como se muestra el hundimiento del Titanic.",

In IMAX 3D it was quite a sight and though it still packs a punch in 2D it loses something.\n\nI find that on repeat viewings it still carries an emotional edge, if only slight but still something to note. It's certainly worth a watch if only to make up your mind.",

    "text": "\"Ghosts of the Abyss\" is a sci-fi type documentary.  James Cameron and Bill Paxton along with a group of scientists, historians, and deep sea explorers head down to explore the remains of Titanic.  It's visually stunning to see the ship at the ocean floor.  The way it has deteriorated, yet parts like stain glass windows remain beautiful and intact.  Runs only at 64 minutes, which is a good run time as the movie does become a little boring mid way through.  This was designed for 3D Imax, so watching it on DVD on a 55 inch tv, really doesn't seem to do it the justice is deserves.  At home it's kind of just a boring exploration of a fascinating subject.  But, I'm sure on a 3D Imax screen this is a real experience.",

I don't understand why they had to go ahead an create new documentary-style scenes when it would have been better to just use scenes from the movie.  What I liked the most was probably the underwater footage of the actual wreck.",
