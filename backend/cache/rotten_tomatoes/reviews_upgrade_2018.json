The hardware STEM physical appearance was archaic but the idea, could exist by 2050 or 2100? Part of what gives away the budget is the cars which for what '70s to 2010s. The essence of the plot with a consideration of self-driving cars and the future according to Musk, who knows?",

    "text": "Basically the entire movie is about the way how technology & robots will take over the world. Production & directory were decent but writing was poor. Movie shows us the future & how ppl will make huge steps into technology development. You can tell by watching that the movie wasn't filmed for breaking profit records in cinematography, so... I think it's fair to give em a 6.",

    "text": "Logan Marshall-Green does a nice job here. The acting chops are solid, even if the writing and directing seems a bit campy. For a movie that seems to immerse itself in cutting edge science, you would think that there'd be a better understanding of how bio-integration would actually work. The reason robots move like robots is because they're made of metal and plastic. There is just no believable way that human physiology would make the same movements simply from a computer implant. The human body would still move with fluidity, and would not be able to just \"plank\"-rise from a prone position on the ground! I chuckled at the car chase where the detective shouts, \"lights\" in her car, and the cruiser's lights and siren come on. Then, when STEM is asked if it can shut down the car it responds, \"I can't, her car is not electronic\". Hmmm. These are nit-picky criticisms, however, for a movie that is overall pretty decent with above-average acting. NBNMF",

    "text": "Upgrade is one of those movies that I think far too many people missed when it first came out. It was overshadowed by bigger blockbusters in its release year, and because of that, it slipped under the radar for a lot of viewers. But let me tell you\u2014this is a film that deserves your attention.\n\nFrom start to finish, Upgrade feels fresh, creative, and unlike anything else in its lane. The direction is razor sharp, with camera movements and shot choices that almost become their own character. The way the film follows Logan Marshall-Green\u2019s performance with such precision makes the action sequences feel both intimate and explosive at the same time. It\u2019s the kind of technical filmmaking that sticks with you long after the credits roll.\n\nThe writing is another strength. The story is tight, engaging, and constantly pulls you forward. Even when you think you know where it\u2019s headed, the twists catch you off guard. It balances sci-fi, action, and even some horror elements seamlessly, all while asking deeper questions about technology and control without ever slowing the pace.\n\nPerformance-wise, this isn\u2019t a film filled with household-name actors, but don\u2019t let that fool you. The cast delivers in every scene. Logan Marshall-Green in particular gives a standout performance that grounds the wild concept in genuine emotion, making you root for him even as the story takes darker turns.\n\nFor me, Upgrade is one of those rare films that rewards rewatching. I saw it in theaters when it first came out and was blown away, and every revisit has reminded me why I love it so much. It\u2019s inventive, it\u2019s gripping, and it feels like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of original story that Hollywood doesn\u2019t often take risks on anymore.\n\nIf you\u2019ve skipped over Upgrade in the past, do yourself a favor\u2014watch it. This isn\u2019t just another sci-fi thriller. It\u2019s an experience, and I guarantee it\u2019ll surprise you. Don\u2019t be shocked if it becomes one of those films you keep in constant rotation.",
