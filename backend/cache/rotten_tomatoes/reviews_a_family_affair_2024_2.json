Shitty mom and grandma, shitty boss, shitty friend: it seems that everything was the main character fall, even if she was bullied from the boss, cheated from the mom, the grandma and the friend, and she also said \"sorry\" for it.",

It's like Nicole Kidman got a facelift and started staring in all these weird sexualized movies. Maybe her version of a midlife crises? Regardless, wouldn't recommend it.",

I am 35 years old I\u2019m not married, I don\u2019t have children, however I wish I would have focused more on family but in this movie everyone I feel is going to take something from it good or bad when it comes to age, love, and relationships! But I enjoyed it and everyone played their roles perfectly as far as I\u2019m concerned and I\u2019m the audience.. I believe that\u2019s what movies and/or films are all about I felt like I knew them lol but that\u2019s what we are looking for!! Wether relatable or not like a fairy tale at the end of some Disney movies I feel like a princess or and fairy and that is what the Director wants. Ending in success!!!!",

It's a silly comedy with a lot of unrealistic moments, but it's a fantasy, so who cares. Love Joey King in this and Zac Efron is fun. This is along the lines of many underdeveloped movies cranked out for Netflix slapped with big name stars to try to get viewers, but it's more fun to watch then most of the others.",

    "text": "At times it definitely felt like the mom's character (and thus the romance) was taking a back seat to Joey King's role, which was an odd characteristic for a rom-com. It was probably the only way this movie could be said to stand out. Not the best performances by any of the actors, and for Efron it was straight-up disappointing. Only if your expectations are already low will this movie slide by, otherwise it'll be a little worse of a rom-com than you're used to.",

    "text": "Despite being predictable, \u3008A family affair\u3009did bring up something that Hollywood doesn't touch or portray very often. The legendary Emma Thompson said that it's always about younger female falling for the older men, and now \u3008A family affair\u3009proved that female being the mature one can still make the magic work. Watching a loving mother who's also a very successful woman falling in love with a \"A-little douche but still nice\" guy after a ten-year long sorrow and heartbreak is something I personally love to see. \n\nNicole Kidman is just as good as always, Joey King is surprisingly good playing this role (Her acting skill was already pretty good), and Zac Afron proved he's more than a hot guy, he can do this and a little beyond my expectation.",
