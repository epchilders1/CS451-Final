The Wild Robot isn't afraid to discuss the darker aspects of isolation, separation, acceptance, the environment, loss, and societal expectations. The strongest aspect of this film is its character dynamics. Lupita Nyong'o as Roz offers a brand new perspective for her career, which shines through as her most unique performance yet.",
