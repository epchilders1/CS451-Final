    "text": "This one\u2019s just a tad bit better than the first one now murder mystery wise, The first one is better because more characters and more harder to pinpoint who it is, but even though it\u2019s name (mm2), it doesn\u2019t have to be a great mystery. It gets the jobs done while being fun. Found some of the characters to be really funny. I didn\u2019t like how how all the side characters who survived in the first one were in it because you knew they weren\u2019t going to be the murderer and if they were that wouldn\u2019t make sense I think if they brought them in, they should\u2019ve at least killed one of them.",

I myself enjoyed this one more. I laughed for most of the movie, as I saw that the friendly rom-com chemistry between the actors and their body language or words not only effected the viewer, but also the events to come. I totally recommend it and advise any film makers out there for more works like this.",

It\u2019s a simple comedic delight that doesn\u2019t require excessive attention to detail or a desire for a more refined, golden-written script.\n\nGrading: C",

    "text": "In short, not a good movie. The cast is made up of a lot of the same annoying characters from the first movie, with the new additions, being even more annoying. The plot is pretty typical, but they make no connection between the main villain and the crime that took place. It\u2019s just a person that randomly shows up and then we\u2019re allowed to believe that they had a part and everything. Not a ton of laughs and an ending that supremely drawn out with no upside whatsoever. I\u2019m sure tons of people watch this and while I funded it with my Netflix subscription I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t pay money to see this in theaters.",

    "text": "You need to go into the movie with the right expectations. This is a straight to Netflix Adam Sandler action comedy. If you aren't a fan of Adam Sandler comedies, this isn't going to be the movie that wins you over. This follows the same tired tropes that Happy Madison Productions are known for. The movie does come across as an excuse for Sandler to go on vacation with some friends. Most of the humor comes from Sandler and crew riffing on each other and then reacting to the action movie events pointing out how absurd the circumstances are. If that type of humor is not for you, this film isn't going to work.\n\nI enjoyed this one more than the previous \"Murder Mystery\" movie. I thought the story was paced much better, the story was less convoluted, and the two leads bickering did not get on my nerves as much. The movie had a great action comedy sequence in the middle that was quite good. And, sans one glaring plot hole, the final action scene is surprisingly clever and suspenseful.\n\nI will say I didn't hate the film, but I acknowledge that it is not a good movie. The movie relies too heavily on the same jokes. All characters introduced are definitively one note. Sandler and Aniston spend the vast majority of the runtime being the one couple you do not want to hang out with at the party. Also, from a murder mystery standpoint, the movie does not give a compelling mystery or reveal.\n\nIf you are looking for something like \"Knives Out\" but dumber, this may be the movie for you.",

It\u2019s a problem when the co-leads have better chemistry with each other than everyone else in the cast does with them or anyone else.  Abbot & Costello or Laurel & Hardy they are not.  The bulk of the conclusion is seen a mile away which negates most of the mystery and surprise.",
