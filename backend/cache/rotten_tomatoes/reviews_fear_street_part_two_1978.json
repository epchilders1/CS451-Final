I highly highly recommend fear Street part two.",

    "text": "This second Fear Street movie was great. Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, Ryan Simpkins, Gillian Jacobs, McCabe Slye, Ted Sutherland, Jordana Spiro, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot of the movie was insane and thrilling. It's about what happened at a summer camp in Shadyside and how it's connected to the first movie. If you haven't seen Part 2 of this trilogy yet, check it out sometime, but see them in order. It'll all make sense.",

    "text": "I absolutely couldn't wait to watch this after getting through Part One this afternoon, and it more than lived up to my expectations. \n\nWhereas the first film was a decent but very flawed love letter to 90s horror, this movie is a more clear reference to 80s slashers, especially Friday the 13th. But it's so much more than that. I genuinely cared about these characters (a standout performance by Sadie Sink, who between this and Stranger Things is one of my favorite young actresses, helped a lot there), and was tearing up during the ending. Add to that great expansions to the lore, a darker, gorier story, and an intriguing twist to perfectly set up the next film, and you have a rare middle chapter that stands out. I'm unbelievably hyped to watch Part Three.",
