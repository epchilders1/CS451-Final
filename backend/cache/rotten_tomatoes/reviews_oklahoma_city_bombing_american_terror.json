These right-wing domestic terrorists wanted retribution and completed the OKC bombing on the same date 2 years later. Luckily they found these guys pretty quickly. Sad story. 2/5 rewatch - not much need to",

    "text": "The documentary \"Oklahoma City Bombing: An American Terror,\" released in 2025 on Netflix, delves into the tragic events surrounding the bombing and examines the motivations behind Timothy McVeigh's actions. It explores how he orchestrated this devastating attack and discusses the possibility that he could have evaded capture. Additionally, the film provides context by touching on the events in Waco and their implications.\n\nFeaturing live footage from April 24, 1995, just two days after the bombing, the documentary presents a comprehensive look at the coverage from various news networks. \n\nI found the documentary to be exceptionally well-crafted; it not only recounts the harrowing events but also includes authentic documentation and live recordings, making it an invaluable resource for those unfamiliar with the subject. Overall, I thought it was an outstanding production.",
