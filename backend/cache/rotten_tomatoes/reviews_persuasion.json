    "text": "At first I thought parody, then caricature, but the final stroke of this film\u2019s message lands on blatant disavowal of what makes Austen\u2019s stories so effective. Nobody, not even the central roles, come across as anything more than roles being played. The wooden writing, the cheeky efforts toward subversive modernity, and the lazy inconclusions of this retelling combine to make for a disappointing watch.",

    "text": "Not the worst adaptation/loose adaptation of Persuasion, despite the licence it takes with the original text. The plot is surprisingly intact given negative comments elsewhere, all the usual set pieces and characters come and go and given what this is, skillfully done with humour and passion. The script additions help to turn up the emotional dial and embellish the characters and drama even if Austen would have seen the interactions as inappropriate. Johnson portrays Anne actually as a female lead worth falling for unlike some of the other adaptations, and the cast are well suited and provide well understood comedy. Not for the purists but for Austen 'feels' and a decent film I enjoyed it.",

    "text": "It\u2019s a Jane Austen movie by people who hate Jane Austen.  The entire movie is characters being as annoying as possible, winking at the camera, and constantly breaking of forth wall, and actors whose ages and background make no sense.  It\u2019s not modern, but postmodern, in a sense that it wants to completely rip up the source material and stitch it back in a way that is supposed to be cool. \n\nThe recent Emma adaptation from 2020 is modern and much better. It\u2019s snappy, witty and colorful without being annoying.",

One good thing that may come out of it is that more people will be encouraged to pick up the book and read it and realize how much better it is than this \"adaptation\" of the book. Like Meghan Markle's Netflix Special, some may want to watch it in disbelief that it is \"that bad.\".",

A fundamental misunderstanding of the narrative tension that makes the original so compelling. \nThe makers obviously had no intention of showcasing what the book does well, but instead needed some story to shove all the things they thought the public liked about period dramas.\n\nMy disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.",

Ich weis nicht, was immer diese Kritiken sollen, dass etwas nicht exakt wie das Original ist. Wenn es gut gemacht ist, finde ich, kann man Geschichten auch anpassen. Ich liebe die Mischung der Tragik der Geschichte und dem Witz. Ich finde auch die Idee super, dass Anne die 4. Wand durchbricht. Viele Momente, in denen sie einem direkt anspricht, bringen mich jedes mal zum lachen oder mitf\u00fchlen. Ich liebe auch Dakota Johnson als Anne Elliot. F\u00fcr mich die perfekte Besetzung. Jeder hat seine eigene Meinung aber schlechte Kritiken, kann ich einfach nicht nachvollziehen. Man kann auch immer noch Filme und B\u00fccher, auf deren Geschichte die Filme beruhen, als jeweiliges gutes Individuum betrachten und genie\u00dfen.",

Instead after about the first 20 minutes I found myself fascinated by it.  It gave me an insight into the characaters and feelings I had not seen before.\n\nFor example, when they are on the beach and re-establish \"frienship\", her words cut to the heart....That things were worse.  They were no longer exes, but then friends.\n\nThis may not have been the classic Jane Austen, but I loved it.  I would definitely watch it again.",

    "text": "I read the criticism and I get this an unconventional adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s story. But isn\u2019t this the point? It can\u2019t be another standard run through of the story because there are already 4 adaptations on Amazon. \nRight so my opinion on the positives. The scenes, outfits cinema graphics lovely! On to the actors Dakota wouldn\u2019t have been my choice given there are so many prime British actresses but she does do a good job of playing Anne and the accent is convincing. Cosmo, Henry and Richard E Grant also do a good job. Critics have panned cosmos portrayal as wooden and stiff but I think he\u2019s done an honest job of playing Wentworth and my god he\u2019s good looking. How did I not see him whilst I was living in Leyton in 2012??? Sigh. Anyway enough with the positives here are the negatives. I\u2019ve watched the 1995 adaptation and I have to reward this film with 2-3 points only. This is because this film has gutted the original jane Austen book which had plot lines all tied up nicely and used beautiful language. Instead of harnessing the strengths of the original script Cracknell has deviated to such an extent that the plot line has changed to the point that it\u2019s unbelievable/ odd and has damaged the fabric of the story itself making it nonsensical. Changes have been made for the sake of being made. We lose threads of the story itself and it\u2019s replaced by unecessary summaries and poorly written and immature script writing, which don\u2019t enhance the storyline they serve to divert treating the audience that they are too dumb to understand Jane Austen\u2019s work. \n\n Example 1: In the book Henrietta explains to a startled Wentworth that Anne rejected a proposal from her brother and thats why he married mary. In the film the audience is given a substituted scene where Anne gets drunk and awkwardly states at she rejected her brother in law's proposal to a full table of guests including mary her brother in law's parents and Wentworth?? What - this never happened in Georgian society and it feels like a badly put together scene you would find during an episode of Eastenders or Corrie! \n\nExample 2: The 2022 film decides to introduce Hayter in the final scene, but in the book hayter was present from the start. He showed an interest in Henrietta, often stopping by. Henrietta firstly interested in Wentworth making Hayter jealous so Wentworths attention is turned to Louisa. His presence in the book is important as he marries Henrietta so I have no idea why Cracknell would casually exclude him.\n\nExample 3: In the book Anne finds out from a widow what William Elliot\u2019s intentions are with her  and why he is in Bath; He intends to stop Anne\u2019s father marrying Mrs Clay. In the book Anne finds out about his true nature through this widow that he\u2019s deceitful and not to be trusted as he has withheld money from the widow putting her into poverty. This information is really imp[ortant as it stops Anne from taking an interest in William Elliot. However, in the 2022 film William Elliott tells Anne himself he\u2019s in bath to stop the marriage and the widow doesn't make an appearence nor is her plight mentioned at all. This just doesn\u2019t make any sense to the plot line - the point of the story is that Anne finds out he\u2019s a bad apple through others and what incentive would William Elliott have for disclosing his true intentions when he is courting Anne???. In the 2022 film he marries Mrs Clay but again this makes no sense in Georgian society - the book more sensibly makes note that he takes her as his mistress not wife.  \n\nAlso in the 1995 adaptation Wentworth is less rigid more suave but arguably Cosmo is still better looking\u2026swoon. Cosmo could have easily have done this but I think this was bad directing that he appears quite stiff. \n\nWe also have other deviations with poor founded replacements - in the 1995 adaptation Anne twists her foot and gets a carriage ride home. In this carriage Anne and the audience gain important information that builds the plot. In the film it\u2019s ignored and replaced by a scene she hugs her nephew. \n\nI personally think that Cracknell had made too many changes to the point that the film became non sensical. Replacing dialogue with scenes of scenary and wide angles just made this bad job of a film even worse and it was correctly panned. \n\nHad this 2022 adaptation stuck to the script and taken it would have packed more content into the film and retained the plot which was already perfect to begin with. If Cracknell's aim was to modernise the film then a better way to do this would have to taken the basic premise of the book and set it in modern day UK. For example, Wentworth could hve been someone who was born into a working class family, left school at 18 and joined the British navy. He could have returned from a tour of Afghanistan and at 30 years old was looking at settling down or taking a position overseas to work in the merchant shipping business. \n\nAnne could have been a young socialite from old money and was persuaded by her family to end the relationship. She could have ended up as a single woman in her early thirties working as a vet or a teacher. All I am saying is that there were many ways this film could have been modernised, which would have allowed alterations of the script to this magnitude to be more accepted. Instead Cracknell just went down the route of shooting in the same locations, same period but it doesnt work as society and behaviour was different in that period.",

Dakota Johnson played the role with an ease and playfulness that requires tact. She eloquently portrayed every single one of those emotions from playful to heartbroken. 3. It was relatable. Period. As a woman, who has experienced the full range of human emotions, it\u2019s easy to wrap yourself in this expansive blanket of emotions. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me squeal, and it made me cry again. The comedic timing was spot on. The varied personalities all fit well together, and created a story that was engaging. Enjoy the ride as it is.",

    "text": "This film wasn't so much a wink to Jane Austen as it was a smirk. In terms of costumes, characterizations, dialogues and accents, it didn't seem to know what century it was in. You can't have a willing suspension of disbelief if you can't immerse yourself into a work of art. But if you're going to get into an 18th century mindset, where women have little social worth unless and until they are married (the number one preoccupation of all Jane Austen's protagonists), then it's just distracting to have characters use modern slang, espouse contemporary social mores and pretend that the very real class and racial divisions of the time didn't exist.",

Them simplifying the dialogs and scenes made it much more palatable to a newer audience but it also made it look like a cheap version of regency writtings (very much like a digestible choice for US watchers). It would've been great as an original concept for a movie, but as a reinterpretation of Austen's book it just felt too silly, despite their idea being making it more alluring to younger audiences",

They're generally excellent actors. \n\nThere is no need to import Americans into British productions to portray British people, especially legacy Hollywood showbiz kids who seem to be trying hard at acting because their mom and dad were movie and tv actors. \n\nSo why, oh WHY did the producers of this turkey give a central role to DAKOTA JOHNSON? Do they think anyone is going to rush to watch this because they're a fan of hers? Won't those fans be disappointed when there aren't any of Dakota Johnson's signature bondage sex scenes in Persuasion? \n\nDakota's shortcomings are only enhanced by surrounding her with prime British actors such as Richard Grant.
