Antonio is an amazing actor and was probably the best part about this.\n\nStory wise, it was far too generic and wasn't even done that well. For one, magically all communication, reception, etc gets cut when these guys are around. No real explanation, just \"giggle giggle we can't reach anyone!\"\n\nSecond, I appreciate attempts at humor, but in a way, it felt very forced. Like when the \"head\" security guard is making jokes and being stupid. Granted, I could see a security guard being like that irl, but it was such a boring, overdone cliche.\n\nThird, there's all this gun fire, even explosions, yet no one around seems to notice. What's the excuse for this? \"dis mall is in middle of nowhere!\"? In almost every city where there is a mall, that mall is either in the center of everything, or close enough that there is always traffic/people around.\n\nFourth, so this girl is a witness, yet the Marshals have very basic security for her. Really? And it takes them ages to even find out something is wrong?\n\nAgain, action wise it's a great movie, but the story is meh.",

Slow to start and with a weak premise, the cast of clich\u00e9 support characters and incompetent mercenaries only stand out due to the lead actors and even then, their performances aren't great.  It's got elements of Die Hard or Home Alone but with twenty-somethings, set in a mall and severely lacking in humour, gore, suspense, or thrilling action scenes.  There's a few good moments towards the end but nothing truly exciting or engaging.",

Overall, the plot, acting, and script are below average. Despite that, it is still entertaining and watchable, only because Banderas is the lead actor. He singlehandedly carries the whole movie.",

Could have been a hoot rather than a DOA stink bomb...maybe, but probably no way to salvage a mess like this.",
