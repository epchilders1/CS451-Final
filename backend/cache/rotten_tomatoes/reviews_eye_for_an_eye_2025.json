The theme of the movie unpacked the potency and psychological effects of everyday violence and bullying, dipping into some interesting backstories. I thought Whitney Peak shined, and the dream sequences were my favorite \u2013 scary, weird and filmed in unexpected ways.",

If you like psychological thrillers with more substance than usualI I highly recommend this film",

With the unforgettable performances of Whitney Peak (Gossip Girl) and Golda Rosheuvel (Bridgerton) driving the film, Eye for an Eye is one of the most unexpectedly rewarding indie offerings 2025 has seen so far. Don't miss out on this riveting gut-punch of a movie...just make sure you have someone to snuggle up while you watch, as it gets SPOOKY! 10/10, amazing film!",
