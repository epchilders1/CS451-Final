It is informative, showing the viewer what the telescope was intended to do and the difficulties it faced in its development and deployment, but most importantly, it created that sense of wonder that such programs should instill in all of us.",

    "text": "A truly insightful and exciting look at the creation, development, and mission of the James Webb telescope.   This is a story of space and time exploration, but more importantly, it is the story of the tenacity and passion of the people who worked on this project for more than a decade.  The story explains for the laypeople how these great telescopes tell the story of time over 13.5 billion years.  There were so many opportunities for this to fail, and it's so miraculous that this did not fail-that it ever made it to space at all.   Worth seeing whether you are a science geek or not.",
