    "text": "This based on a tv series spin from the same name is very funny, stick with the same series humor like you expect too and even has same Hispanic legends and lore plus heritage you learn form it like the tv series which also nice. Do like that end the series with movie cause gives a Ronnie Anne a good arc and she is with her Mom which didn\u2019t get enough of in tv series. Even the movie is about Ronnie Anne and growing up but it does give you a two subplot to tie it together with Bobby and his flat paper Mache of his Dad taking selfie for his father cause of have to stay there and which would more explanation but if u paying attention and know the show and then you why he his there. Second subplot the two brothers try a practice a game for the \u201cFestive Of Lights\u201d in the small town in Mexico and of course they use that to defeat the bad guy and later of course you see it play out. The movie does good job for its running time setting up the plot and moving forward pretty well and the animation looks really great and that her turning 12 like Lincoln Loud but only difference you him growing up in his small town but this works cause when you see her again in the original you get good understanding what has been going with her. I would like a season 4 but the movie makes me proud that we get a good ending and experience more of everyone personality especially Ronnie Anne\u2019s Mom Mar\u00eda and got know her better. All in all definitely recommend if like show like I did then go watch it now! I give a A+\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
