This gives additional inspiration.\nCast fits perfectly on their roles. Soundtracks help feel all emotions more strong.\nI recomend this film if you need inspiration for make dreams true.",

    "text": "The Devil Wears Prada is not only an interesting glimpse into the fashion industry it is a true masterpiece in novel to film adaptation. \n\nWhere the novel has the character of Andy just being upset at her rude boss, the film makes the smart design to balance Miranda's perfectionism with the people around her (including Andy) actually understanding why what Miranda does is so important. \n\nOne of the best movies of the 2000's.",

    "text": "Okay. I was so skeptical before watching the movie because I knew it was a cultural phenomenon but I was like will I enjoy it like is it my type of movie and I can say it was one of the best films I have ever watched ever.\n\nFirstly let's start with the overall astethic of the movie. Abosuelty gorgeous and fantastic. I loved the feel and vibe of the setting and time period. Definetly elevated the movie.\n\nThe overall story. Oh my gosh. It was PERFECT. like no notes. I was engaged the full way like I was hooked and I was obsessing over it. Like there's so much I can say but god it was so good to get a feel and flavor of what's it like inside the fashion industry and thats why I loved it so much cause I really have dreamed of a movie like this. I enjoyed seeing the rush of what's it like to be personal assistants for somebody and dare I say, this is literally a dream of mine like doing this type of job. Like i was watching the movie and I was like boy I hope this is me in the future even if not involved in the fashion industry. \n\nThe acting. Emily Blunt. Oh she SLAYED the role as Emily so bad like she was my favourite acting performance in the movie but boy were Meryl and Anne incredible. Meryl WAS Miranda Priestly like I can see the hype now surrounding her performance. Her nuanced way of putting up a front but you could tell what she was truly thinking inside. Anne Hathaway a star. I think she absolutely suited the role of Andrea/Andy. I think you could tell they enjoyed filming the movie. \n\nThe songs I think were perfectly suited to the movie. No notes there.\n\nOverall, it ATE. I can't belive I've gone do long without watching the movie. The only thing I'd say is I wish we saw more of Paris Week like more behind the scenes or whatever. That's just me though. \n\nOh you bet ill be eagerly anticipating that sequel.",

    "text": "What The Devil Wears Prada has to offer is quite unusual for the era of romantic comedies in which it premiered, but rejecting the tired clich\u00e9 romance and embracing the idea of fashion and the formula of sharp comedy not only seems fantastic, it is. Streep and Hathaway, united, deliver one of the most acclaimed rivalry duos in cinema history, shaking up the entire industry with bold dialogue and memorable characters. The phenomenon is right here.",

    "text": "I am here reviewing this movie because I want to see the sequel.\n\nIt is an amusing story but with serious things. The title tells the story about how insufferable working behind fashion can be. Although, David Frankel may not be the goat of film directing.\n\nAnne Hathaway portrays Andrea \"Andy\", the main focus who is suffering from her boss, Miranda (Meryl Streep), especially that her twins want things a certain way like they wanted to read \"Harry Potter\" through a manuscript instead of a book.\n\nAndy acts so troubled that Nate (Adrian Grenier) did not want to be with her anymore. Does that mean it is best not to gain ones you love if you are too busy focused on work? Do not worry, Miranda was troubled too.\n\nWhen I heard of the name, \"The Devil Wears Prada\", I thought this was a song by Madonna like \"Papa Don't Preach\". And that is OK, because there are many Madonna songs in the movie.",

Meryl Streep, as always is the start of the show, Anne Hathaway brings to life complex, but likable character.

Emily Blunt was a big part of this film yet sadly doesn't get enough credit for her contribution.  A great story, a great title, and some terrific filming in both NYC and Paris.",

    "text": "The first time I watched this film when I was a child in the late 2000's. I was impressed with this glamours world of high-fashion. I didn't understand Andy's decision to leave the role of Miranda Priestlys assistant, because I was sure that everyone wants to be on the top and have luxurious clothes. \n\nLately I rewatched this film with a fresh eyes. I totally agree that Miranda is vicious, arrogant, notorious sadist. I think todays gen Z and Alpha wouldn't allow to be treated like that. I was happy when Andy decided to quit. In pursuit of success and Mirandas approval she lost herself, because Andy is kind inside and don't want to walk over people. \n\nBut at the same time I can understand why Miranda became herself. The world of  show business is wild and if you want to survive, you should have a strong character. \n\nThe film kept me interested. I like all this little quips, funny scenes and cheesy moments. Highly recommend this film because of engaging storyline, important topics and memorable characters.",

It's fun to see her start to care about her job and slowly winning Miranda's respect. Good cast with Emily Blunt and Adriene Grenier also. Had a few chuckles. 3/5 rewatch",

    "text": "The Devil Wears Prada is more than just a movie; it is a cinematic experience that has earned its place as a modern classic. From the opening scenes, the film immerses viewers in the high-stakes world of fashion journalism, blending sharp wit, biting commentary, and compelling character development. It is a rare film that feels entirely crafted for its audience while maintaining broad appeal.\n\nThe performances are extraordinary. Anne Hathaway embodies Andy Sachs with a perfect balance of vulnerability, determination, and understated charm. Watching her navigate the ruthless, glamorous world of Runway magazine is both relatable and inspiring. Meryl Streep\u2019s portrayal of Miranda Priestly is iconic, combining icy authority with subtle gestures that make her one of the most memorable \u201cboss\u201d figures in modern cinema. The dynamic between Hathaway and Streep is electric, creating tension, humor, and emotional resonance that carries the film from beginning to end.\n\nDirector David Frankel deserves considerable credit for balancing these performances with a visually stunning presentation. The cinematography, wardrobe, and set design are meticulously curated, reflecting the luxury and intensity of the fashion world while supporting the narrative. Each frame feels intentional, whether capturing the bustling office environment, the sleek runways, or the glamorous streets of New York. The editing enhances the film\u2019s pacing, ensuring that comedic moments land effectively without undercutting the story\u2019s emotional stakes.\n\nOne of the film\u2019s greatest strengths lies in its character development. Andy\u2019s transformation from an unsure, naive assistant to a confident, self-aware professional is compelling and satisfying. Unlike many coming-of-age stories, her growth is gradual and earned through challenges, mistakes, and moments of reflection. Miranda, meanwhile, is revealed to be far more complex than a one-dimensional antagonist. Her exacting standards, sacrifices, and personal motivations make her both feared and fascinating.\n\nThe screenplay is sharp and memorable, filled with witty dialogue, clever observations, and moments of pure comedic genius. Beneath the humor, however, lies genuine insight into ambition, mentorship, and the costs of success. The film manages to explore the pressures of a demanding industry while remaining deeply human, offering moments of tenderness and reflection alongside its high-fashion spectacle.\n\nEven years after its release, The Devil Wears Prada remains relevant. Its combination of powerhouse performances, intelligent writing, and visually striking production ensures that it continues to resonate with audiences, whether they are seeing it for the first time or revisiting it decades later. It is a film that rewards multiple viewings, revealing new details in its performances, dialogue, and design with each experience.\n\nFor anyone who has not yet seen it, this film is essential viewing. And for those familiar with it, it is worth revisiting. The performances, humor, and fashion remain timeless, confirming The Devil Wears Prada as a masterclass in storytelling, character work, and cinematic craft. It is a film that endures not only as entertainment but as a cultural touchstone that will continue to be admired for years to come.",
