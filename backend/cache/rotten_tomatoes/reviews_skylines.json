    "text": "I don\u2019t know why the scores are so low on this movie because I became big fan of these movies after I saw the 1st movie & I love all the sequels Beyond Skyline (2017), and Skylines (2020) & a 4th skyline movie is coming out. It\u2019s called Skyline: Warpath & it is in development so that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get all the low scorers. The movies obviously did well enough to make 3 movies and working on a fourth movie.\n\nEvery movie is connected to each movie so you have to watch them in order for it to make sense and if you did watch them in order and you still think the movie was bad then I don\u2019t know what to tell people because it is really good and I know other people that I\u2019ve seen them and think the same thing I can\u2019t wait for part 4",

    "text": "Overall, Skylines, as a third instalment, delivers what I generally expected.\u00a0 It is a brainless sci-fi film with cheesy characters, cheesy dialogue, and predictable outcomes. Having seen all three films, this is undoubtedly a pleasing instalment thanks to the new and expanded plot and story. Sci-fi effects and visuals are positive, and I am confident that many fans of sci-fi will enjoy this feature. The plot is quite different when compared to the other two movies, and I am also thankful that the director was able to aim for something different to make this film stand out from the rest, along with continuing the story. Naturally, this is recommended for those who enjoyed the Skyline series and other B-grade sci-fi films.",
