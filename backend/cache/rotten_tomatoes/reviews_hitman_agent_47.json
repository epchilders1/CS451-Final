Rupert is the best part of this movie and he brings a very different air to Olyphant did to the character. I wouldn't call this a reboot at all and I think that's where people are expecting too much.  The actions scenes are methodical, much like the video game itself.  Worth a watch.",

    "text": "One comment on Chris Stuckmann's review of this film called Agent 47 an accurate adaptation of somebody who's really bad at playing Hitman and I can certainly see where this is coming from. The action is fine but when you think of the Hitman IP, you think getting in and out without causing a scene and seeing 47 engaging in shootouts in wide-open spaces suggests that the executives were skeptical of a stealth-focused narrative believing that audiences would find that boring. Then again, the most recent game at the time the film came out was the polarising, action-focused Hitman: Absolution so what do I know? The best sequence doesn't even involve 47, it just has the female character, who's arguably the true protagonist, making her way out of an airport without getting caught by security cameras. But on the other hand, I did not see this film as remarkably awful. There are ludicrous elements such as something I'll generously call a glorified bulletproof vest and that handcuff thing 47 did that was in the trailer which, if it were in a Fast & Furious movie, I'd consider it more ludicrous than the outlandish stunts we see throughout those films but not really bad enough to warrant being called a cinematic disaster. Rupert Friend does do a good job in the role and the action scenes are okay but overall, this is a clich\u00e9d movie that fails to appeal to fans of the game due to being too action-heavy for their tastes whilst action movie fans will complain that it feels too much like a video game. True, it's not as bad as Taken 3, which was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding the Bourne style of action filmmaking, but it's hard not to suspect that this was an attempt to cash in on the surprise hit that was John Wick as quickly as possible because of concerns that it might end up being a flash in the pan. Makes me wish the film dealt more with the idea the first trailer was selling that 47 might be a villain, due to focusing on the victim's POV. Also, Zachary Quinto doesn't show up for Heroes Reborn to play a character who turns out to be Sylar reimagined in the context of a more grounded action movie. The 2007 film was better but I can't say either one of these video game movies had much to talk about compared to others I've seen, both fundamentally stronger and fundamentally inferior, even without Uwe Boll's name attached to them. The 2007 film is a standard spy film gunning for the 24/Bourne crowd whilst this version is a very by-the-numbers action film that has arguably fewer people involved that actually gave a damn about the IP they're adapting.",

The action sequences are passable apart from some extremely jarring cgi, characters are pretty bland and the story is paper thin.

Bloody critics. \n\nI thought the director did a very decent job with some subtle scenes that were great to watch, he did a really good job and the story was actually really good. They kind of used the plots of terminator 1 and 2 in one movie which was a really cool thing to do in my opinion. \n\nI mean who the hell wouldn\u2019t dig that in an action movie?\n\nThe acting was perfectly fine too, nothing wrong with it at all. I loved the leading lady and definitely would want to see more of her. \n\nI really think that this director and these actors could collaborate again and do some really great work.",

I understand how some \u201ccritics\u201d could rate it so low, but this is probably one of the best movie adaptation of a video game I\u2019ve seen or can think of. There are nice touches of the game\u2019s mechanics and the point of the games (at least back in 2015 since the story/game has changed over the years) being to kill the target and be unseen. I would almost consider this a nice origin story for 47 since Friend look very much like a younger version of the character. \n\nOverall, this movie is a nice watch for fans of the video games. I am glad it is faithful to the franchise while still being \u201cgrounded\u201d.",
