Toilet humor, none of the charm or heart of 1-2, feels like Illumination before Illumination. The animation is blander than ever. The new characters are completely forgettable, trash villain.",

    "text": "Shrek The Third?, More like Shrek The Turd!!!!\n\nWhen i started watching this movie i didn't think that is going to be a hellhole but now that i finished it.\n\nHear me out\n\nThis movie is super godawful and now i understand why nobody talks about it.\n\nI can't believe that dreamworks decided to ruin the and entire franchise that was so important for both childhood and adulthood\n\nIt's a babies movie. And they knew it beacuse of the vomit fetish humor\n\nThe first two Shrek films were clever, satirical fairy-tale adventures with a surprising amount of emotional depth. They balanced crude humor with sharp writing, layered characters, and heartfelt moments.\n\nShrek the Third abandons that balance entirely.\n\nThe animation isn't as impresive like the past movies the fact that the production of this movie started somewhere in 2006 makes you think it was rushed made with no love.\n\nThe jokes are incredibly boring, dull, stupid and worst of all, it's not funny. the only good joke was probably that one where donkey went to college but even with being saud i didn't even laugh, chuckle or even smile at that joke\n\nEvery single characters was somehow unlikeble \nThe welsh wizard, the princesses, shrek, puss and even donkey aren't good writing like they should\nESPECCIALY PRINCE CHARMING AND ARTHUR they are so beyond abysmal characters PRINCE CHARMING is an annoying selfish spoiled idiot that im glad he died during the end and ARTHUR does not deverve to be the king of far far away\n\nThe plot is pretty predictable at every point the fact that prince charming is the villian AGAIN and also throws a entire musical like sequense makes it one of the worst IF NOT THE WORST VILLIAN AND THE WORST SCENE IN DREAMWORKS'S FILMOGRAPHY \n\nThe story revolves around Shrek trying to avoid being king by finding Arthur to take the throne \u2014 meanwhile, Prince Charming leads a coup.\nProblems:\n\nThe stakes feel incredibly low. There\u2019s no urgency or believable danger.\n\nThe \u201croad trip to find Arthur\u201d takes up most of the runtime and barely develops anyone\u2019s character.\n\nCharming\u2019s villain plot should\u2019ve been tense and dramatic, but it\u2019s treated like a side quest until the last 15 minutes.\n\nThe final resolution (Arthur giving a speech to bad guys) is anticlimactic to the point of absurdity.\n\n(Jesus Christ, they can't even write a good speech the live up the mood correctly)\n\nShrek the Third has\u2026 a few forgettable pop covers slapped into montages. Nothing that sticks in your memory or feels tied to the narrative.\n(They can't be compared to the golden musical masterpiece like All Star)\n\nShrek the third ads nothing to the shrek franchise and now i understand why people sticken it from the shrek saga\n\nDreamworks deliverd a movie that's terrible that the only \"OKAY\" thing is prince charming's death scene its kinda satisfactory\n\nThe pacing is very slow it's 90 minutes but stuff like bad jokes, pointless scenes drags a lot\n\nAnimation: 3/10\nHumor: 1/10\nCharacters: 0.5/10\nPlot: 0/10\nMusic: 2/10\nPacing: 1/10\n\nI want everyone to avoid this movie at all cost. But it's still better than Youtube rewind 2018\n\nIt's a simple, horrible cashgrab that doesn't deserve your time.\n\n0.5/10\n\n\nA",
