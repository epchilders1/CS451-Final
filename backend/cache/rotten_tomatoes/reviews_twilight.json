    "text": "This was meant for teens to watch, and in that way, it's sort of enjoyable. My daughters made me watch the whole series over Thanksgiving, and this was the best one. Story is okay. Acting is pretty atrocious. Kristen Stewart makes the same face throughout the film, looking like she's going to vomit. The thing I dislike most is the character of Bella. She is so vanilla boring, and her only personality trait is to be clumsy. It's hard to believe all these creatures are so in love with her. It would be so much more interesting if they portrayed her as more of an outcast or something. And she's really dumb. When Edward tells her he's killed people in the past, she just says \"I don't care\". Nice. \ni didn't like the direction either, some of the disorienting camera shots for no reason, the flashbacks that were unneccasary. \nBut, it's an okay movie. But there is no need to watch all the sequels. They suck, except maybe the last one.",

I\u2019ve been watching it since I was little, and from the very first time I saw it, I created a kind of love that just stayed with me. honestly, every \"chill\" moment I remember from my life somehow includes me watching this movie. it feels like it became part of my story, you know? it marked me in such a special way, like a movie that just hugs you.\n\nthe vibe, the rain, the town, the whole atmosphere\u2026 everything pulled me in, and even today I feel the same affection when I watch it. it\u2019s a movie that follows me, that gives me that warm nostalgia, that makes me feel like I\u2019m going back in time for a second.\n\nand like\u2026 I love the story, I love the romance, but I\u2019ll be honest: the only thing I\u2019d change is that, in my opinion, it would\u2019ve been SO much better if Bella ended up with Jacob. I always felt like they matched more. but even with that, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Twilight will forever be one of my favorite movies.",

    "text": "Rating: 6.4/10\n\nTwilight is a moody, awkward, and era-defining supernatural romance that's more effective as a cultural time capsule than a great film.\n\nHighlights\n- Faithful Adaptation: The film is an exceptionally faithful adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel.\n- Central Romance: The romance created a global phenomenon, launching Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson into superstardom.\n- Indie Aesthetic: Director Catherine Hardwicke brought a unique, indie-film aesthetic to the project.\n\nCriticisms\n- Structural Issues: The plot relies heavily on Bella's internal dialogue, which can feel clunky.\n- Mixed Reviews: The film received mixed reviews, with some criticizing the performances and pacing.\n- Dated Effects: The special effects and stunt work are unconvincing and dated.\n\nVerdict\nTwilight is a fascinating cultural artifact that succeeded in creating a cinematic phenomenon, defining a generation of young adult romance despite its technical flaws and critical divisiveness.",

The sparkling skin, the shock and allure of vampirism as Bella is exposed to Edward and his family. \n\nA few things just don\u2019t work like Jasper\u2019s angst coming across as constipation. The makeup for vampire milk white skin is odd and distracting. Overall it\u2019s interesting as its own story but it\u2019s definitely not as impactful as the book. I wanted a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d type interpretation but this fell short.",
