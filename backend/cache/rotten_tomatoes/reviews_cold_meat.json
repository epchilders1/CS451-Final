    "text": "In a sea of movies, we often hit hidden gems, most of them pleasant to the eyes. It is common, likewise, that the gem turns out to be just glass after care polishing. Cold Meat starts strong with a great opening scene but lost itself in the long run. \n\nThis movie is also a great example of false advertising. I had to rewatch the trailer to see if I was not going insane; is it that I completely misinterpreted the trailer altogether? \n\nNope. The trailer advertising and the final cut are completely different stories. That would be fine if the final cut was at least interesting, but it isn\u2019t. \n\nCold Meat starts with a voiceover telling of a legend about bad people and Nature\u2019s justice. Pay close attention to this info because you will only get to see it again by the end of the movie. \n\nThen we get to a great opening scene showing huge traits of characters David and Ana, our main characters in this mess of a story. I will give it that the acting is at least good and commendable. This scene is the only good thing about this story, like chewing a sweet gum that ends up spilling spicy pepper sauce all over your taste buds. \n\nThe rest of the movie takes place in one setting without much happening, which would turn out interesting if the psychological aspect had better details. The dialogue is just plain and boring, not enough to keep us hooked. \n\nAnd yet, I persevered. I endured because I\u2019m that person, I wanted to see the end of the tunnel. \n\nTurns out the light was a freight train coming my way. \n\n90 minutes of downhill uninteresting plot points until a huge, unexpected Ex Machina, one that, although kinda foreshadowed, just comes out of nowhere, a cheating player or a breaking bug in a software. \n\nHad the movie used its own advertised premise as the main theme for the story, I think Cold Meat would have better chances. As it is, I can\u2019t see a valid redeeming factor about this story.",
