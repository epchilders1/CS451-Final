    "text": "While I do lament the tradeoff of coherent storyline for a higher bodycount that occurs with each entry in this series, John Wick movies have never claimed to be or tried to be anything more than what they are: An adrenaline fueled wild ride at the side of Keanu with a pile of corpses at the end. And they are oh so good at doing just that. They always come up with something new and exciting to give us action wise, one-upping the previous film. Which from a filmaking perspective deserves praise. And Keanu always delivers a performance worthy of the name John Wick.",

Nesses crit\u00e9rios, \"John Wick 3: Parabellum\" se encaixa no meu preferido. Narrativamente, esse n\u00e3o \u00e9 o melhor filme da saga \"John Wick\" (2014-2025) \u2014 embora n\u00e3o seja, de forma alguma, um filme ruim, apenas n\u00e3o supera o primeiro \u2014, mas \u00e9, sem d\u00favidas, o meu preferido. Por qu\u00ea? A a\u00e7\u00e3o. Esse filme cont\u00e9m algumas das melhores cenas de luta que eu j\u00e1 vi, com destaque especial \u00e0 espetacular cena do corredor das facas. Para um f\u00e3 de ac\u00e3o como eu, aquilo n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas uma cena. \u00c9 uma sinfonia.",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\nAs a pure action film, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" (2019) is a 10/10 experience. But the story in here unfortunately does not hold up to the action. Surely it follows the storyline set in a first film, but that was some time already ago and they kinda need to start moving in some other direction with plot. That said, as an action film purely, \"John Wick 3\" is a blast. Fight scenes, action, choreography is a Hollywood at its best. This movie is also very brutal, like in a knife scene in museum - you won't see this kinda stuff in your average flick. But it is not a gore fest, thankfully. Mark Dacascos is in this movie and he was a pleasant watch. Halle Berry has a short but spectacular scenes - the fight involving dogs is completely something new. \n\nOverall, \"John Wick: Chapter 3\" is a spectacular action movie that start to loose its steam a bit because of the story. I know its for a dog, not a simple dog but common.",

    "text": "I just watched a grown man use 3 horses as a weapon. \n\nAs I go through this rewatch one thing is clear, these movies are getting better as they make them. More creative action sequences, new weapons, and a universe that continues to expand. \n\nThe knife fight in the history museum is one of my favorite scenes in all of these films. Not to mention the use of dogs in this one. You would think that they would lag the action scenes behind a little bit but they don\u2019t. They fit into the scenes like water. \n\nOne thing I did notice in Parabellum is that the last few assassins that fought John Wick actually had a chance to kill him. They were just so obsessed with fighting the legend that they wanted to keep it going. In the end, that saved some of their lives.. others not so much.",

What I like about this film is just a great action film rather than just shooting  it focuses more on action without shooting and more of character and world building. First film where John Wick got my attention and made the watch worth it.",

Much like the Elder in John Wick 4, I was not a huge fan of the Casablanca part, while I did love how they explained the marker and coin origin, but the accents... But the book killing, the countdown, the Continental showdown, it was all pretty cool.",
