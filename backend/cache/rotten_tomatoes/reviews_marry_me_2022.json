    "text": "One burning question: Owen Wilson, why? I love him, but this is not the right project for him, IMO. The sript is flat and predictable with meh dialog; there is no room behind the subpar performances of his costars for him to shine. Not sure, but maybe better editing could have helped. Pacing was way off. The stage performance sequences were too long and interrupted the story development. Much of it should never have made final cut. The best thing about the movie is that it is streaming on Netflix so you can simply fast forward past the boring parts. However after a few times, even the most die-hard movie watcher like me finally had to click out way before the end. It just never got better. It lacked entertainment value and gave you no one to root for.",

But it goes along with all the disgusting photos that have been posted by or about her lately stating she is showing off her figure which by the way isn't that great and doesn't  need to be  seen by everyone.  Your image is just flushed deeper down the toilet every time your do these immature things.  So sad.deeper",

    "text": "Cute, catchy movie but predictable. Jennifer Lopez is a famous singer in this movie (as she is in real life). She plans to get married to her boyfriend, who is also a famous singer, during a concert after they sing their song \"marry me\" together. But right as she is going on stage, she notices that everyone around her is looking at their phone. She takes her manager's phone and reads the news: her singer bf is caught in a video cheating with her assistant. She doesn't marry him on stage anymore. Instead, she says she wants to do something different and points to a man in the audience who is holding a \"marry me\" sign that his friend gave to him. Jennifer Lopez said she will marry him. He is a math teacher who is divorced and has a daughter. He actually only came to the concert so that his daughter would think he is fun (as fun as her stepdad). He ends up saying yes to help the singer out. The singer extends their time together and they end up going on dates. And falling in love. And they stay together, even though they're very different people. She is surrounded by cameras always, which he has to get used to but she also turns away the cameras sometimes to get quality time with him. She supports him in his math classes and math-alon.",

The characters who were the leads had a lot of reasons to behave and talk in a certain way throughout the course of the film. Owen Wilson was really good though you felt maybe the director could have added some more depth to his character. It was slightly more real than most of the rom coms coming out of Hollywood.",
