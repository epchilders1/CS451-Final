Nonexistent. The characters? Emotionally hollow. The jokes? So bad they made me question the concept of humor itself. \ud83d\ude10\n\nGene the \u201cmeh\u201d emoji was the perfect metaphor \u2014 not because he was relatable, but because I was also meh for 86 agonizing minutes. \ud83d\ude29\nThe pacing felt like watching a buffering YouTube video on 1% battery. \ud83d\udd0b\ud83d\udc22\n\nEvery frame whispered: \u201cThis was made by a marketing team, not artists.\u201d \ud83d\udc94\nBy the time the credits rolled, I was staring into the void, wondering how a film could make Pixels look like Citizen Kane. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nFinal Verdict: \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9 out of \u2b50\ufe0f\nThis wasn\u2019t a movie.

    "text": "The Emoji Movie is a disappointing attempt to cash in on smartphone culture without offering any real heart, humor, or originality. The story feels forced and predictable, the jokes rarely land, and the constant product placement makes it feel more like a long commercial than a film. Even the talented voice cast can\u2019t save the shallow script or the lifeless animation. Overall, it\u2019s a soulless, emoji-filled mess that fails to connect with kids or adults \u2014 a movie that should have stayed in the drafts folder.",
