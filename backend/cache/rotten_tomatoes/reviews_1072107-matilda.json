    "text": "Matilda becomes a disturbingly effective tale of a child battling a world ruled by monstrous adults. The film\u2019s cheerful colours only deepen the unease, turning every scene into something slightly uncanny.\n\nMiss Trunchbull is a genuine horror villain\u2014towering, sadistic, and atmosphere-warping in every appearance. Matilda\u2019s telekinesis, instead of feeling whimsical, plays like a quiet haunting: objects moving with eerie calm, hinting at power born from neglect and fear.\n\nWhat elevates it is the contrast between darkness and hope. Matilda\u2019s final victory feels like a classic horror triumph, where the smallest, quietest character outlasts the monster.\n\nStrange, unsettling, and unexpectedly powerful\u2014Matilda works shockingly well as a child-centered horror tale.",

    "text": "All Time Classic. It's a shame this wasn't well received in 96'. It's difficult looking back to really understand why but sometimes gems like this fall through the cracks. It's a shame because man it would've been amazing too see what DeVito could do more of behind the camera. This is easily is crowning acheivement as a director. Fantastic direction in this. I love all the wide shots, how we see things from the view of a child, and how it changes as Matilda stands up for what's right representing her arc. Just first rate all around. Amazing cinematography and incredible practical effects that hold up remarkably well. Matilda is easily the best thing about this and is so charming, quirky, likeable, and good person beyond her years. Miss Honey is awesome too. Everyone else is really good too. This is basically if someone literally took the idea of Carrie and made it into a fantasy family comedy. It weaves effortlessly between being comedic, wholesome, and scary at times too. Just enough where it should'nt terrify little ones. DeVitos narration is excellent too and gives it more of a fairy tale feel as well. Wholesome, charming, and very original this is something everyone should give a watch once.",

I also believe it teaches parents to pay more attention to their children\nDanna reina 1001",

I don't have much left to say. this movie is definitely worth watching. the only flaw I have with this movie is I really wished the film could be a bit longer. but still, this is a very good movie in my opinion. overall, 9/10.",

    "text": "I first watched this movie in preschool and barely remembered it so I now wanted to rewatch it as an adult. This is a very creative and unique movie that is very good for kids, particularly for younger girls. Pam Ferris gives and incredible performance and Danny Devito as the director gave the movie a different and artistic flavor as well. This movie teaches pretty decent values to children overall, and who would\u2019ve thought that a hiding and running sequence throughout a big home could\u2019ve been shot, edited, and executed so tense yet so rich with entertainment?! Sure some parts of the movie are silly and ridiculous, but it can\u2019t beat out its charm!",
