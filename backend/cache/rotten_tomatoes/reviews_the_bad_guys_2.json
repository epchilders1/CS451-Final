    "text": "The Bad Guys 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish.\nThis sequel doesn\u2019t just match the energy of the first film\u2014it elevates it. The animation is slicker, the jokes land harder, and the characters feel even more confident in their chaos.\n\nThe story is fast-paced without ever feeling rushed, blending heist-level tension with that signature charm that makes the whole crew impossible not to love. Every set-piece is bigger, bolder, and more inventive, and the film somehow manages to deliver heart without slowing the momentum.\n\nWhat really makes it shine is how effortlessly it balances humour, action, and genuine character growth. It\u2019s one of those rare sequels that understands exactly what made the original great\u2014and doubles down on it.\n\nIf you loved the first movie, this one will feel like a gift.\nFun, stylish, and wildly entertaining\u2014The Bad Guys 2 is pure joy.",

Sometimes I wish the movie had a different animation style or different animals because it reminds me of Zootopia. The comedy was chef kisses  Snake was my favorite character in this movie. I would definitely recommend giving it a watch.",

While there are a few moments where side plot tangents continue for a little too long, the action is always plentiful when its moments come.",

DreamWorks really needs to make a third one! \n\nThe blend of comedy, action and some romance was really great! The post-credit scene shows that there is a high chance for a third movie and hopefully it is going to happen! \nOtherwise, great movie!",
