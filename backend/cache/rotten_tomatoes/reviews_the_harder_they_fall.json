The actors trying to come off as tough, weren't, because the dialogue wasn't great. No one had a \"grill\" back then, nor did they talk like modern day \"thugs\", or dance around with blue body paint, and almost naked except some jewels strategically placed. There was some good action in spots, and a couple good actors, so I gave an extra star for that.",

At its core, the film suggests a brutal truth: blood is thicker than water, and in this world, water\u2014symbolized by faith, community, and redemption\u2014is often powerless to cleanse the stains left by blood.\n\nThe church, a traditional symbol of sanctuary, appears repeatedly in the backdrop of shootouts and confessions. But it doesn\u2019t save anyone. It doesn\u2019t intervene. It\u2019s just another building in a town built by Black hands, now torn apart by Black pain. In this narrative, the church is water\u2014present, but unable to quench the fire of generational trauma.\n\nNat Love\u2019s final act of killing Rufus Buck, his own brother, is the ultimate proof that blood ties don\u2019t always bind\u2014they can suffocate. Rufus spared Nat as a child, branded him with pain, and built a town that could\u2019ve been a haven. But the sins of the past were too heavy. Nat\u2019s bullet wasn\u2019t just revenge\u2014it was a rejection of a legacy too twisted to redeem.\n\nThis film doesn\u2019t offer clean morality or triumphant justice. It offers a lament. A warning. A mirror. It asks: What happens when blood becomes the only truth we honor, and water\u2014the institutions meant to heal\u2014is left to evaporate in the heat of our rage?",

    "text": "Wonderful cinematography with a masterful score. Charming and witty characters with some memorable performances, especially from the lead. However, that being said, there were some fairly cringey scenes of singing that hardly lived up to their intended mark and some dialog that should have been left on the paper screenplays instead of making it through to the script. You could sence that the actors felt uncomfortable. Thus making us viewers uncomfortable as well.",

It is overly stylistic at times and is 30 minutes too long, sections you just want to fast forward through. The action is pretty good.  It was \nok and I fear the movie will not age well.",

More like modern day Black people trying to make a point. There is nothing that is truthful about this western movie concerning American in the 1880s. As I said, Horrible acting and everything is FSF that,",
