    "text": "SPOILERS. Megan Fox's absence was immensely felt throughout the entire movie, and her character was written off in the laziest way possible. There were a lot of inconsistencies throughout the movie, and a lot of stupid moments that felt completely detached from the story (even though they were really funny and enjoyable to watch). Despite this movie's shortcomings, it was still an amazing movie, and I had a lot of fun watching it. The action and visuals were incredible, and I will never get tired of hearing Peter Cullen's voice as Optimus Prime. I definitely recommend it for action, sci-fi, and combat fans, and of course for fans of the Transformers franchise!",

    "text": "while ins't as great as the first film , it's an improvement of revenge of the fallen and it has many iconic and memorable moments like the dreads , the Chicago battle and Sentinel prime before TFOne's version of him and this easily has the best of Steve Jablonsky's musical score",

    "text": "After rewatching this movie, the lazy writing is frustrating. Sentinel Prime using the rust cannon, obviously a powerful weapon, only once in the movie is insanely bad writing, and to kill off Ironhide in a way that he can't return is ridiculous, everyone else in the franchise can be resurrected, why can't he? Oh it's because he rust melted..lazy writing, we need better.",

    "text": "Rating: 5.9/10\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon is a grim, self-serious, and punishingly long blockbuster with impressive visual effects, but a soulless and exhausting experience.\n\nHighlights\n- Visual Effects: The visual effects are a monumental technical achievement, with a breathtaking final battle.\n- Action Sequences: The \"Driller\" Decepticon sequence and wingsuit action are spectacular.\n\nCriticisms\n- Poor Screenplay: The plot is convoluted, self-serious, and incoherent, with a plodding pace.\n- Unlikable Characters: The human characters are at their worst, with Sam Witwicky being angry and entitled.\n- Cynical Direction: Michael Bay's direction is grim, nihilistic, and devoid of wonder.\n\nVerdict\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon is a technical showcase serving a terrible movie. Its impressive visuals are overshadowed by a joyless, punishing, and forgettable experience.",

    "text": "Transformers: Dark of the Moon is perhaps the best Transformers movie besides Bumblebee (2018). The story is much better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, with three subplots that lead up to the main plot with one of the most unexpected betrayals in cinema. Shia LaBeouf's character is developed significantly better than the last two films. Sentinel Prime is a well written villain since he has actual motives than the previous villains, and he raises the stakes higher for the Autobots. The ending is a bit messy, but led to what could've been the ending of the trilogy. Overall, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is definitely worth watching with your friends and family, it has its dumb moments, but it is thrilling for all audiences with it's ship of stunning CGI.",

    "text": "Absolutely absurd seeing people complain about these movies. If these reviews were posted pre-2015 then OK, I get it. People didn't know what was coming. But typing this crap in 2020-25? You kidding me. These movies are a friggin master class in popcorn movie making compared to the soulless AI generated garbage we have now. One thing though - screw Steven Spielberg for getting Megan fox fired for violating his alien taboo standards, and screw Michael Bay for listening to that jumped-up prick.",

    "text": "Though I happen to be bored, the film is still a great movie the CGI hold up today. This film just gets hate for no reason this is one of the best 3-D films ever made plot twist, revealing sentinel prime to be the antagonist was shocking since despite not reading all the movie comics with me only having one that being defiant the rest I read online. I still understand the story. Of foundation \nThe criticisms are exactly the same as the prequel trilogy. Those criticisms about bad dialogue could suck my dick because this trilogy is an absolute must see unless you hate the prequel trilogy or are too attached to G1 to the point where you weren\u2019t ready for a new take on the Transformers franchise if you happen to not like those films, then they\u2019re not for you\n\nSure, the film is more boring than revenge of the fallen but but it still has its redeeming factors \nThis despite being the least enjoyable from my experience, everyone else could enjoy this film unless it\u2019s not for you",

This is my I guess 2nd watch, though I have to say, I hate, really hate how are they hiring so called \"good looking\" girls to literally make some fan service. First 2 movies Megan Fox, and this movie with Rosie. \nThroughout the WHOLE movie, where they had a literal war, dirt everywhere and they went through hell, she still had her make up perfected, hair done and no dirt at her face AT ALL. Not only that, 2nd movie Megan Fox was same too... she never got any wounds, nothing at her face she was perfect.. I hate that how they use women in their movies as literal baits. But the fighting part of the whole movie is just as amazing as it is.",
