The film starts with a sad bank teller named Stanley Ipkiss that find a mask that gives powers to him, his life sucks so when he finds this mask, his life changed completely, the police tries to get him and some bandits try to get the mask because of the powers to get revenge on your boss.",

    "text": "3.5 stars;   I was really stuck on Jim Carrey movies back when he was funny: \"Ace Ventura\" series, \"Dumb and Dumber\", \"Liar Liar\", and of course, \"The Mask.\" This was a clever spoof of the popular superhero movies of the 90s. What made this a completely out-of-the-ordinary comedy film was the hilarious physical humor of Carrey. A gold star assist goes to the CGI special effects, ala \"Roger Rabbit\", and the sexiness of Cameron Diaz.",

    "text": "The Mask is one of the quintessential \u201990s films. I watched it endlessly growing up, and every time felt just as fun as the last. Even though it shows its age now, it still stands as one of Jim Carrey\u2019s best performances.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t work: the villain. He\u2019s dull, his plans are uninspired, and his motivations are scattered \u2014 revenge, rage, stealing the mask, winning over Cameron Diaz (which, sure, I get). It\u2019s as if his character description only said \u201cbe villainous.\u201d It feels like the idea was to make him a serious counterbalance to the Mask\u2019s chaotic energy, but Carrey could have created that contrast with almost anyone opposite him. The story drags whenever the villain is on screen, especially after he finally gets the mask.\n\nWhat does work: Jim Carrey. No one else could have played this role the way he did. Lines that would sound cringey in anyone else\u2019s delivery unfortunately became my personal catchphrases as a kid. The CGI \u2014 especially for the time \u2014 was phenomenal, blending cartoon animation and physics into live action in a way that still looks good. And, of course, that dance scene. I could write an entire review on that moment alone.\n\nWith its dark comedy tone, Carrey\u2019s unforgettable performance, and impressive use of CGI, The Mask remains an endearing and lasting piece of \u201990s pop culture \u2014 even with its weaker antagonist and uneven story. The mask is one movie I\u2019m happy to say represents the 90\u2019s in the best way.",

Whole cast excels in character, nobody could have portrayed Stanley better than Jim Carrey. Absolutely bonkers, very fast paced and filled with witty one liners I still use to this day. Highly entertaining",

Trish does barely anything but looks pretty and needs a man to save her. The best character was Milo; he had the funnier moments with the mask on than Stanley.",
