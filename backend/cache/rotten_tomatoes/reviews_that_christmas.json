The bible is God's inspired word, not inspiration for your women's equal representation crap. This has got to stop, you will not instill your lack of respect for the bible in our children.",

Coloca a est\u00f3ria de crian\u00e7as alguns dias antes do Natal, fazendo uma constru\u00e7\u00e3o de cada personagens, cada um com suas qualidades e limita\u00e7\u00f5es. Colocam os adultos em um segundo plano. Conta a est\u00f3ria da professora que todos tem medo, mas tem seus traumas e o garoto que tem seus pais divorciaram e se sente s\u00f3 no dia do Natal, depois que o pai havia prometido estar junto, mas n\u00e3o veio. E de duas irm\u00e3s g\u00eameas que uma \u00e9 vista como toda certinha e outra ovelha negra. At\u00e9 que chega o dia do Natal o PApai Noel tem v\u00e1rios desafios. A coloca\u00e7\u00e3o do Papai Noel se torna em segundo plano aqui. MAs de forma muito inteligente. Onde temos a est\u00f3ria do garoto sozinho e sua professora, das duas irm\u00e3s g\u00eameas e do grupo de crian\u00e7as que est\u00e3o em uma casa sem adultos que est\u00e3o presos na Kombi, depois do acidente. Desde a supera\u00e7\u00e3o do garoto e entender o amor a sua m\u00e3e. Da irm\u00e3 e os pais compreender a inten\u00e7\u00e3o da outra filha, que sempre foi de prote\u00e7\u00e3o. E de as crian\u00e7as poderem extravasar a criatividade e transformar do lim\u00e3o uma limonada. E ao final fechar com desaparecimento da irm\u00e3zinha e toda a cidade se unir para encontra-la. E ter um final feliz.\nVale apena assistir?: Parab\u00e9ns!!!!!! Chorei de emo\u00e7\u00e3o, v\u00e1rias vezes. Tocante. Simples e perfeito. \nTraz o Espirito Natalino na ess\u00eancia.\nNota: 10",

I\u2019m surprised who people would\u2019ve thought this was intended for. That Christmas was an incredibly enjoyable movie. It had several stories going on because it was imitating Love Actually style. Whatever, it was great and I want more movies I can watch like this with my kids that don\u2019t have obnoxious characters with bad attitudes.",
