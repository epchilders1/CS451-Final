For what it could have been I would expect to be completely gripped by such a movie but I thought it only scratched the surface of what it could have been. It should have focussed solely on the boy and showed almost every intricate detail of his daily journey. We don't get that, we get a surface level insight into his journey and a surface level insight into their family life. It's actually boring and didn't commit to either. The documentary footage was the most compelling which makes you wonder that probably a documentary would have been better",

    "text": "A inspiring tale that provokes a conversation on boyhood, masculinity, and the intimate nuance between fathers and sons. While at times predictable and likely because of the source material, Director Andrew Kightlinger fuses adventure, myth, and a rocky (pun intended) father son dynamic to tell a compelling, touching story that pits innocent angst against patriarchal pride that\u2019s timely today to remind us just how important the balance between work and family truly is. \n\nMoreover, the film is worth a watch for its technical elements as well, which prove that $5M indie dramas still have a place against the saturated visual effect spectacle. Cinematography feels real, especially at the treacherous summit, which effectively highlights that you don\u2019t need high budget VFX to create emotional anchoring. \n\nLastly, the indigenous elements while interesting and certainly central to the film\u2019s catalyst moment could have been further explored throughout the film a bit more to build more suspense and heighten the stakes even further. Despite this, Kightlinger proves his empathic and collaborative approach to filmmaking that\u2019s so badly needed for our American film industry. \n\nSave this one for Father\u2019s Day.",

So much of life seems sensationalized these days, but Mr. Kightlinger resisted the obvious with this event and allowed us to experience it up close, so we could go beyond the overt.",

    "text": "\u201cLost on a Mountain in Maine\u201d tells the remarkable true story and deserves to be among the classic American coming-of-age films, right alongside \u201cStand By Me.\u201d  Luke David Blumm does a fantastic job portraying the complex experience of 12 year-old Donn Fendler lost alone in the deep wilderness of Mount Katahdin.  Donn emerges nine days later a different person, and no longer the boy he was. It is to the director\u2019s great credit that Donn\u2019s growth feels organic and unforced; the transformation is subtle, believable, and beautifully embodied by Blumm, whose performance is riveting.  And it is not only young Donn who is changed; the adults in his life, and his relationships with them, are also transformed.  In particular, Donn\u2019s father\u2019s (Paul Sparks) love for his sons mellows from a tough-love inspired by life during the Great Depression, to an unconditional love and appreciation of both his child\u2019s vulnerability, and undeniable grit.  This will be a great movie to watch over and over as a family, as a holiday tradition, and as a reminder of the strength of children and of love.",

    "text": "I'm a Mainer, so I've heard this story many times as it is a part of most kids' school curriculum growing up. But this film isn't primarily interested in the survival aspect of Donn's story. What it seems to truly be after is painting a wonderful and complicated image of a father and son relationship. While this means that, in the end, you will be drawn to tears, it also means that this movie feels much slower that it should have been. Better pacing with a greater urgency would have propelled this movie into five star status. However, it is absolutely beautifully shot, well acted, and has a very moving, if subdued score. In the end, Donn's story is done a tremendous amount of justice, and I am glad to know that his tale put to film will inspire millions of kids outside of our great state. Read the book!",
