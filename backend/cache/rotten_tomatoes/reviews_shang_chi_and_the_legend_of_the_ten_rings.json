The cliffhanger was also a bit predictable. The movie was full of action but it was also humorous because they made jokes while being in a serious situation. I don\u2019t particularly like action movies but this really changed my perspective. I do like movies that feel adventurous and the movie was just that.",

Unfortunately there was just too much back & forth in timelines which, of course, makes for a fragmented story and one that spends a bit too much time on family drama.  After an hour or so, it becomes a story about a dysfunctional family infighting that just got worse as it progressed. It\u2019s basically the Star Wars trilogy crammed into one movie... which makes it\u2019s story just a 1/3 of what Star Wars story was.  Ultimately, there\u2019s just too much that disengaged me; from the back & forth storytelling, to the subtitles, to a proxy villain until the final minutes when the final boss shows up with no build or purpose.",

The cast is strong, the pacing flows well, the CGI and fight choreography look fantastic, and the humor strikes a solid balance without undercutting the drama. The characters are engaging, and the plot delivers exactly what you\u2019d want from a superhero introduction.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the genre, but it doesn\u2019t need to. Instead, it executes the formula with confidence, wrapped in a beautiful blend of Chinese folklore, striking visuals, and a standout score.\n\nA stylish, well-crafted film \u2014 and absolutely worth watching.",

The main character is interesting, but lacks any grounded action or compelling narrative. Wait, what? Why is Awkwafina a sniper now? Great ingredients that don't quite stick the landing.",
