It's a must see, critics are sometimes crazy, don't listen to them, this movie is badly underrated. Perhaps the only critic I can make is the unnecessary use of poor CGI at the end of the movie.",

None of the Tarzan movies ever showed the apes as being different like they are in the book, this is the first movie I\u2019ve ever seen where they actually showed that they were not Gorillas in the conventional sense. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and thought Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd did an amazing job of bringing Tarzan to life in a way that haven\u2019t been done before. I don\u2019t like that people seem to criticize this movie more than they just enjoy it for being fun.",

    "text": "While I found Skarsgard and Robbie to deliver a real-feel take on Jane and Tarzan, this film clung to its colonialist history more than it explored the wild fantasy of Tarzan, leaving more to be desired as it came to a close. All in all, an enjoyable movie for its cast and shots, but these aspects were not enough to supplant its mediocrity in novelty and innovation of an age-old character.",

The scenery is gorgeous and the technical effects impressive from stampedes to 1800 european cities. It's been a while since I saw a movie this great. It is full of action so it never gets boring.",
