Gary Gray\u2019s latest project, Lift, is a complete scam of a movie and just continues Netflix\u2019s trajectory of over-budgeted action thrillers with no personality and zero rewatchability. Red Notice and The Gray Man have set the standard, and Lift has come in and lowered the ante.\n\n\nFull review on my Substack: https://benpatten.substack.com/",

The heist in itself is embarrassingly dumb. Despite a couple of cute characters in the crew, the movie is a forgettable affair, that lacks the wit, the charisma and the inventiveness necessary to the genre. Charmless.",

    "text": "Of its type, top flight. Think Oceans 11 or The Italian Job with a hint of Mission Impossible. It's not art & it isn't Mission Impossible, but it's very well done. Lots of drama, a little romance, a touch of humor. A somewhat implausible plot but that IS the type.\nActing is competent, the script & dialogue are fine. Great scenery, locations, feel-good vibes. Pure entertainment. No hint there'll be a sequel, but it's plenty reprise-capable, so good odds there'll be a Lift2. Netflix is producing some very good content.",

With most action movies you can predict the ending but i did find it entertaining from start to end.\nI actually think it got better as it went on.. but still a standard action film.\nId recommend it to anyone.\nIt's a perfect light watch.\n\nOh I just realized people are mentioning it's a comedy. \n\nIt is not. It's a standard action film.",

    "text": "First I determine what I enjoy, half of movies made in Hollywood that receive Oscar's are boring and I would never watch them.  When I watch tv or a film  I want to be entertaining, full of mystery, intrigue, comedy, drama.  Critics have no idea what people enjoy watching.  Their opinions mean absolutely zero, nothing, everyone has to decide for theirselves.  Do not go by what others say when it comes to music, tv or a movie. You decide.  How would you feel if someone said I do not like your team.  If you didn't like this film you must have a very boring existence.  Break away from the real world and enjoy being entertained.",

Most of Kevin Hart's fans love him enough to hate that his acting skills were being hidden behind the desire of everyone else to have the \"funny guy,\" the guy that people want to laugh with or at but never seeing his serious side.  His fans have been waiting for a combination of whit and seriousness that shows another angle.  If you are a true sleuth/action/humor fan, your senses were activated from beginning to end.    To Kevin Hart, this is one of the best choices for switching it up.  Perfect! Five Stars.  Many of the fans favorite actors or mine: Batalon, Reno, Mbatha-Raw, D'Onofrio Gorman.  Added favorites are Magnussen, Proud, Corbero, and Kim.  I am going to call it.  Lift II, III, IV.  Waiting for the next Trailer.",
