    "text": "The critics are so wrong about this movie. Sure the cgi birds are a little janky but the acting is phenomenal. This movie is sad and emotional but not heavy. I cried and laughed. That is what a movie is supposed to do, make us feel, immerse us in the character\u2019s experience.  Melissa McCarthy is such an amazing actor, her performance has such depth. It is a bit melodramatic but not overly so. I loved it \ud83e\udd70",

    "text": "This is a movie about how couples can process grief so differently. Mostly it\u2019s typical of men to be selfish just like jack was and never thought to consider how lily was feeling and handling the loss of her baby . The movie had its deep emotional moments and funny moments mostly of course because Mellisa McArthy is a great comedian and actress . I recommend to watch , but just be aware it\u2019s a movie about sensitive subject of losing a child and I thought the bird part was funny and enlightening. I actually had a similar situation with those birds in my backyard . So it really hits home to see it\u2019s a common occurrence with those birds lol",

    "text": "This film is a hidden gem\u2014layered with poignant drama, moments of quiet introspection, and a depth that resonates with anyone who has faced loss. While it carries a steady emotional weight, its message unfolds with clarity, sometimes in the most unexpected ways. Tears are inevitable, woven into a story brought to life by a cast delivering performances on par with some of the finest in the genre. Melissa McCarthy balances her signature charm with raw vulnerability and just the right touch of eccentricity, while Chris O\u2019Dowd takes viewers on a deeply somber yet profoundly human journey through the complexities of grief. By the time the credits roll, there\u2019s a sense of healing\u2014but only for those willing to fully grasp the sacrifices this couple endures in the name of love.",

    "text": "I lost my husband suddenly and tragically a little over a year ago. I have been a lot like Lily's character. I appreciate that the movie brought out the fact that the main characters were already the way they were when faced with the loss of their child. I also liked that they didn't say there were \"answers\" to grief. Mental fog is a real thing too. That was one of the scariest things to deal with, especially returning to my job just one week after my husband's death. Thankfully, my errors were not as significant as some of Lily's. I liked how the vet continued to use his therapeutic skills to help his clients. So needed. I appreciated the interactions between all the different characters that showed the complexity of human experiences. It's a really good film to cause one to think, feel, and develop a heart of understanding and compassion for others.",
