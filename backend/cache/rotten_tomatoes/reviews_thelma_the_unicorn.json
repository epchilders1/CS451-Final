If you want an animated movie with animals, just watch Zootopia, or the bad guys, or even Over the hedge! Yeah this movie is straight up trash. 1/10 trash movie never watch it.",

It\u2019s one of those films that the closer you pay attention the better it is. Oh, and the music ROCKS!!\nLoved this movie!",

    "text": "Looking at the surface, there should be no reason to have high expectations for this movie. But it was the behind-the-scenes talent that got me intrigued. It is directed by Jared Hess, the man who brought us \"Nacho Libre\" and the Oscar nominated Animated Short \"95 Senses\". The movie is based off the same author of \"The Bad Guys\", which was a surprisingly good time. And even has a writer from the hit and miss show \"Teen Titans Go!\". So, I actually went into this film with optimism. Too much hope for what this movie deserves.\n\nThis movie is the very definition of a (5/10). It is a completely average animated film. At the 5-minute mark of the story, you can guess EXACTLY what's going to happen. It is one of the most tired and clich\u00e9d kids' movie story you can imagine.\n\nWhat's ironic about it is that the same writer already did a spoof of this exact same premise in \"Teen Titans Go\". The writer goes from making fun of the tropes, to making a sincere version of the same story with no variation or twist on the formula.\n\nIt's nothing offensive, it has a few good jokes. The world of talking animals and people living together leads to some fun possibilities. Even the flies in this world can talk, that's something.\n\nThe music in this is just fine. Not great, not bad... you may have noticed that as a common theme for this review.\n\nBut it's also nothing special. It is not a rarity, it does not sparkle or glimmer, it just...is.",
