I am a fan of the originals, it pleases me, it's not a hard watch, but it's too much. But i give extra credit for the Harold Ramis homage. It was really beautiful.",

Also much more heart and development of the main cast. For me this is the real reboot of ghostbuster and I look forward foe the next installment to complete this really good reboot trilogy.",

    "text": "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire sacrifices plot for fan service. Yes, it\u2019s fun to see the cameos and to hear the characters say the thing, but the filmmakers should have spent more time developing a good story. The script makes people act out of character, just so the plot can advance, and requires that the audience turn a blind eye to logic and reason. I can\u2019t hate this movie, though, because it\u2019s still a love letter to the Ghostbuster franchise, there is fun to be had, and there are some impressive visual effects. However, much like Ghostbusters II, this lackluster sequel falls short of its predecessor.",

And while it certainly isn\u2019t better than the original two it doesn\u2019t do anything bad enough to make it horrible. Though the big bad villain concept is getting boring and the final confrontation felt boring. Afterlife also didn\u2019t need a sequel it felt like it wrapped up the holes left from Ghostbusters 2 not having a sequel.",

It wasn\u2019t eerie or scary at all, Ghostbusters works when it\u2019s creepy and scary and the crew cracks jokes, not when you have day time ghosts and silly CGI, and no storyline.  They gave us a wizard? Who cares. They gave us OG busters that didn\u2019t do anything\u2026 they gave us a storyline about committing suicide to be a ghost and have a relationship with another ghost?!?!?  My kids didn\u2019t care for it, they liked afterlife but this one was so dumb.  They could have nailed it\u2026 who reviews these movies?!?",

Mostly, it feels like a live action episode of The Real Ghostbusters. Right up that alley. Phoebe gets into more trouble due to her inability to connect with the living. Callie and Gary are a more solid couple with Gary experiencing the ups and downs of parenthood. Trevor is in that awkward late teen phase. Not quite an adult, but not a child anymore. Winston has expanded the research of Ghostbusters into several branches. Ray, with the help of Podcast, now has a YouTube channel. Everything gets weirder when a brass orb is brought into Ray's book shop. See it for more.",
