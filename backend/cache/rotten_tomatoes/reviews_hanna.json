THE MOVIE ITSELF IS ABOUT AS IF \"LUCY\" (2014) IS LOOKING FOR X-MEN TO JOIN THEM BUT THEY'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND SHE HAS NO SUPERPOWERS... IT WAS COOL THAT HANNA (SAOIRSE) HAS SUPER STRENGTH AND SUPER INTELLECT BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MUCH INTERESTING TO WATCH IF SHE HAD TELEKINESIS OR IDK IF SHE WAS ABLE TO SUMMON FIRE FROM THE PALM OF HER HANDS. SAOIRSE THROUGHT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS SO GRACEFUL AND CONVINCING! OVERALL THE MOVIE WASN'T BAD.\nBUT IT WAS MISSING SOME DETAILS, LIKE IT WAS UNFINISHED... THEY COULD'VE SPICE THINGS UP A BIT BUT THEY KEPT IT OLD FASHIONED...",

    "text": "Best known for period pieces like Atonement and Pride & Prejudice, Hanna feels like a bit of a departure for director Joe Wright.  Raised in isolation by her father (Eric Bana) in a remote area of Finland, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been raised to be a lethal assassin, her purpose in life to kill the woman who murdered her mother.  On a journey that takes her from Morocco to Germany, the young girl tries to adapt to a world she doesn\u2019t understand while maintaining focus on her ultimate goal of revenge.  While Ronan\u2019s performance is the main reason to watch, it\u2019s also impressive how Wright manages to transition from sedate, deliberately paced drama in his previous efforts to wildly unhinged action set pieces in a thriller that manages to hold the viewer\u2019s attention throughout.",

Frustrating and ridiculous at times but no doubt very enjoyable if you can somehow just turn off your brain and not be annoyed by the continuous flow of point to point leaping around and coincidences. The directing tries WAY too hard to be nouveau. Accents aren't great either.",
