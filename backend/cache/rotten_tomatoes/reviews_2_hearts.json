I loved the narrative and the shocing twist of events. I highly recommend it. RT 17% vs audience score of 87% that is all you need to support my review and to enjoy a beautiful film.",

I initially thought Jorge would be the one passing away. \n  I could see life as a young man in Chris having fun with your buddies and brother\u2019s being the jokester. Later having the Steve\u2019s of your Father wanting for you to do better in the interest of you being able to support yourself later in life. \nI enjoyed seeing both Jorge and Chris falling in Love and building their relationships. \n  I was blind sided by the real results which brought me to weep as I thought what if something this tragic ever happened to my boy\u2019s. \n  This movie definitely reopens the Thanks we should give to God for this shot period of time we have here with each other. To be able to Love our spouses, kids, and friends as if tomorrow is not promised. \n   Geez, this movie was hard to watch\u2026painful at the same time Beautiful \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Thank You God for everything, my wife, my Family and this time here on earth.",

    "text": "What if I started this review telling you how I liked the main characters in this movie. How they were likable and easy on the eyes.\nBut then jumped to the Gabriel House in Jacksonville, and how it was created by the real-life Jorge Bacardi after he received life-saving surgery?\nYou'd probably get annoyed because you'd wonder what one story has to do with the other. \n2 HEARTS is a lot like that: 2 seemingly unrelated stories that jump back and forth without any reason as to why they're connected. Is she the daughter of Jorge who's now in college? Is he the illegitimate son of the Bacardi fortune. Did they get killed by Jorge's limo?\nThe ending will probably cause lots of tears... that is if you get to it. And it's there that you'll learn why the writers & director are telling you these vacuous romantic tales. \nFor me, the ends didn't justify the means. This is poor storytelling with underdeveloped characters, no goals/motivations/desires explored and I'll be d@mned if I could ever find a theme because, well, the characters have no arc. \nI don't know if the story is more powerful if you know the real true story behind the movie's inspiration. I didn't until the end and I still find this story unsatisfying. Just because it's base on a true story doesn't mean that you can be boring. Not really worth your time.",

    "text": "This movie appears in its beginnings to be a lightweight nearly Hallmark style romcom, until it takes a serious turn in its final third, and this third act redeems the project. And at its conclusion, it makes a compelling and useful statement. The directing and script are is choppy but the movie has, per its title, plenty of heart.",
