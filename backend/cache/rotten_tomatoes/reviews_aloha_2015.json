A LOT of effort (4 years worth in fact) was spent just rewriting the script specifically for Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, among others. Great directing by Cameron Crowe, not an easy movie to bring to screen. Good cinematography and visually quite pleasing. Enjoyed it",

I keep asking my wife if she understands what's going on and she kept saying no until she just fell asleep watching it. Congratulations, Cameron Crowe, you made me hate all the actors in this movie that I like, especially John Krasinski and Rachel McAdams. It never got better and then it just ended. What a convoluted mess.",

    "text": "Alright, so it was \"meandering\" and a bit wacky. I liked it much more than I thought I would. I resonated with the spiritual air of the film. I enjoyed how it portrayed that mystical undertone in all of the scenes. I thought the family dynamics and tension were handled with care; finally there's a moral ending that didn't involve infidelity. The acting was wonderful though Stone came off a little strong. I imagine some of the film's messages may be closer to home now than when the movie came out. Possibly my favorite aspect, though, was the mannerisms of every character. You could feel the atmosphere change with each person and all of them had a spark of something deep. It feels like their world is one without \"supporting roles\" and \"extras.\"",

Overall the plot was rushed - it felt disconnected and as if the feeling of the scenes was being shoved into your face. A miss for me dispite many reasons to want to like it.\n\nThis felt like a parody of a Crowe film, to the point it reminded me of a Wes Anderson flick, and not the best ones either.",
