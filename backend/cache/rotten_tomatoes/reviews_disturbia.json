He watches his neighbor and becomes obsessed with him.\nThe film was made in 2007. It has a little romance between Kale and Ashley. It is more a thriller than a comedy.\nThe movie catches your attention and gives you butterflies in your stomach.\nI like the characters and the story. It is interesting and a bit funny. I recommend it because it is shocking and crazy!",

He is stuck at home because Turner (the protagonist) punched his Spanish teacher. In my opinion, this film is a five-star movie and good for people who like thriller movies because it makes you feel nervous. The actors are good, and the story is interesting.",

    "text": "Spoilers: go watch this before reading. OK, so to start, there was not enough ambiguity in the plot. It would have been nice if the story kept you guessing until later on as to whether he is a bad guy or not. I guess you could argue that the deer was the red herring, but come on.  Yes, the neighbor is a serial killer. That's basically the whole movie, plus some \"making out\" between shia boof and no-name actress number 1. I gotta say that this straight up rip off of Hitchcock's Rear Window left much to be desired. I suppose you could call it a \"remake\" or something, but it was very unoriginal either way. I guess maybe I'm just not that into high school love interest stories, and don't really like bs non-suspenseful suspense thrillers. This one just wasn't for me. If you want a better rear window remake with kids, try Fright Night (either version). Pass on this one.",

It's an early success for writer and eventual director Christopher Landon, as well as the talented young cast. At just about 1.5 hours the film could certainly have been extended a bit, but is impressively economical and entertaining.",

    "text": "\u201cDisturbia\u201d ultimately falls short of its potential, delivering a thriller that feels both shallow and underdeveloped. The characters lack meaningful growth, leaving little room for the audience to form any real connection with the leads. The narrative itself suffers from thin plotting and minimal world-building, offering tension without the necessary emotional stakes. Ironically, the supposed antagonist ends up being the most engaging presence on screen, which undermines the intended suspense. In the end, the film\u2019s lack of depth and uneven execution make it more frustrating than thrilling\u2014a misfire not worth the time.",

But, of course, it has its flaws here and there, like its slow pace in delivering suspense, which is its main genre, and its rushed and unremarkable resolution. Other than that, it's a good film for a movie night.",

    "text": "Disturbia is a suspenseful horror-thriller starring \u2b50\ufe0f Shia LaBeouf, and honestly, I think it\u2019s one of his most impressive performances. The story follows a teenager under house arrest who begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer. The twist? He can\u2019t leave his house, so he\u2019s forced to witness terrifying events unfold from his windows.\n\nI found the film to be incredibly engaging from start to finish. The suspense was constant, and it kept me locked in the entire time. Shia LaBeouf does a phenomenal job portraying a young man struggling to convince everyone that what he\u2019s seeing is real\u2014while they all assume he\u2019s just being paranoid. His performance truly carried the emotional tension of the film.\n\nI also really enjoyed the supporting cast, the creepy villain, and especially the unnerving and clever behavior of the killer. The way everything unfolds is smart, stylish, and perfectly paced. The director nailed the atmosphere, and the writing team did a great job with the misdirection, making the audience second-guess everything right alongside the characters.\n\nDisturbia is a tightly-wound thriller with just the right amount of psychological tension and mystery. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspenseful stories with strong performances and twists that actually land.",
