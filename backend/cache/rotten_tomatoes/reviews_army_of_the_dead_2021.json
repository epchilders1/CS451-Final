    "text": "Army of the Dead has a solid premise - a zombie heist set in a quarantined Las Vegas is undeniably exciting. But somewhere between concept and execution, the story loses its footing and never quite recovers.\n\nThe characters are so fundamentally underwritten that the few who actually deserve attention are pushed to the sidelines like Coyote and Dieter, and I would have liked to see more from Peters, yet we barely see enough of them to care. \nInstead, we\u2019re force-fed a focus on Scott and Kate, which is genuinely baffling. Scott, okay fine he\u2019s the designated lead. But Kate? What cosmic purpose does she serve? She is just simply\u2026 there.\n\nThe entire subplot where Kate wanders off to rescue Geeta feels like it was stapled onto the script during a coffee break. Are we meant to believe she\u2019s suddenly a savior of the oppressed? Nothing in the film builds that foundation. One sad glance at a group of kids does not create a character arc. And as for some of the other characters, I won\u2019t waste oxygen discussing motivations that barely exist.\n\nTo the film\u2019s credit, the idea of zombies evolving into a structured society with hierarchy and leadership is genuinely fascinating. Had it been introduced with care or explored with depth, it could have set this movie apart. Instead, it\u2019s rushed, overshadowed, and ultimately feels like an afterthought buried beneath chaos and noise.\n\nA bold concept, strong visuals, and a premise brimming with potential and yet Army of the Dead ends up a massively missed opportunity to deliver something great. Still, with lowered expectations, I would say it's a solid one time watch.",

    "text": "Army of the Dead (2021) The first 30 minutes are quite boring, the characters are rather weak and lack any charisma. But if you enjoy watching zombie movies, I recommend you watch this one. I was also expecting to see a lot of action, but there isn't much.",

    "text": "Army of the Dead was a Netflix movie about zombies in Las Vegas. Naturally a casino heist is involved so cue \"putting the team together\" montage and then add in zombie tigers, zombie horses, robot zombies, martial arts zombies, even pregnant zombies. The action is fine, CGI is marginal at best, Dave Bautista is good, but the way the movie is shot with the blurred background gets annoying fast. Overall, the run time is too long, the plot is silly, but if you like zombie movies then you might like this.",

So many questions that I just can't wait for it to be answered. Lots of crazy things you will spot after rewatching multiple times. Zack set a good foundation for a hopeful franchise to take off. Except that is never going to happen now because netflix quietly stopped all production of Lost Vegas and Planet of the Dead.",

    "text": "\u201cArmy of the Dead\u201d is a thrilling cinematic experience that brilliantly blends action, horror, and a touch of dark humor. The movie\u2019s intense pace keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, with each scene carefully crafted to deliver maximum impact. David Bautista\u2019s performance is nothing short of extraordinary; he brings a deep, emotional complexity to his character that adds a surprising layer of depth to the film. His portrayal of a conflicted hero navigating the chaos of a zombie-infested Las Vegas is both compelling and memorable. The ensemble cast, stunning visuals, and innovative take on the zombie genre make \u201cArmy of the Dead\u201d a must-watch for fans of action-packed thrillers. It\u2019s a masterful blend of storytelling and spectacle, and it\u2019s easily one of the best movies of its kind.",
