    "text": "Liam Neeson shines as the hard boiled detective here. I love these types of movies and I think A Walk Among The Tombstones is one of the better additions. Its much more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to some of Neeson's more action-packed films. The story does drag at times and there were a few choices at the end that I felt held it back. But overall, this was a solid little detective story.",

    "text": "[SPOILERS WARNING!]\nFirst of all, I think that Liam is one of the worst actors of his generation. Somehow it worked for him in Schindler's list, and in Taken, maybe he was well cast in something else that I didn't watch, but per se he just can NOT act.\nHis facial paralysis might be even worse than Keanu's.\n\nNow the movie.\nWannabe-stylistic but ultimately just presumptuous.\nA very useless, tired, old, incapable ex police turned cop because of some vendetta he went on while drunk.\nNow got hired as private detective to find who killed his client's wife.\nSome wannabe-clever subplots just to make it look like the writer actually made some effort, but they are dumb attempts which have no substance and leads nowhere.\nThe killers kill again. Then kidnap a girl. He gets hired via recommendation from his previous client to negotiate.\nThings go awry, they escape, they had cut the 14 y/o fingers without any reason, now they shoot dead his previous client's brother, he shoots one of them, they still escape, a kid from one of the two useless subplots irresponsibly hid in their truck and almost got discovered, but so can tell them where their base is.\nThe one who got shot gets killed by the other one just like that, no other reason.\nThey arrive. He handcuff the dude to a metal pipe. The previous client stays to kill the dude although he, as ex cop, disagrees and leaves.\nBut then he comes back and for some demented reason the client has uncuffed the criminal and he's dead.\nHe gets plummeted badly because he's useless.\nBut he has a taser and stuns the dude and shoots him the head.\nIn other words, not only the two bastardy killed 2 women, cut the fingers of a girl, and this last dude killed his victim's husband now, but they both went out easily, just one bullet. The last one in the head, no pain.\n\nWhat I hate the most in a movie centered on revenge, is when the revenge doesn't arrive.\nThere's no reason for this movie to exist.\nIt's a mistake.\nLike the fact that Liam still acts.",

This movie is not for the squeamish, many scenes are disturbing. But the direction is excellent and Neeson is on top of his game. Moreover, the two bad guys personify evil like few others in recent memory.",

    "text": "A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) is better than I remembered. One of the strongest Liam Neeson films and performances from him in the past decade. Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook, and David Harbour are excellent in their supporting roles. Scott Frank's dark neo-noir direction is ruthless with a truly bleak worldview. The detailed and nihilistic writing makes for an engaging mystery. Fair warning, the serial killers are very disturbing to watch.\n\nIt holds up nicely.",

    "text": "Liam Neeson has enjoyed a renaissance lately, reinventing himself as an \u2018elder statesman\u2019 of action movies, what with the \u2018Taken\u2019 trilogy and \u2018Non Stop.\u2019 Therefore, I couldn\u2019t help but go into \u2018A Walk Among the Tombstones\u2019 thinking that it was going to be another \u2018blast-a-thon\u2019 of gunplay and high-octane action.  It wasn\u2019t.\n\nI even \u2013 briefly \u2013 read a post on the internet concerning the film.  It simply read \u2018Totally dull.\u2019 To be fair, I can see where they\u2019re coming from.  If you go into this film expecting something like Taken then you\u2019re going to be left sorely disappointed.  Luckily, when I watched it, I was obviously okay with something a little slower.\n\nLiam Neeson plays... well, basically the same badass character he keeps playing lately \u2013 you don\u2019t really need to know his name.  He could almost be the same guy in Taken.  But, anyway, he\u2019s an ex cop turned private detective who\u2019s hired to investigate the kidnap and murder of a drug dealer\u2019s wife.  First of all there\u2019s comparatively little action, despite quite an intense opening shootout, there\u2019s not that much else to follow (besides the odd \u2018roughing up\u2019 of a few shady characters here and there.  The story is mainly about Neeson\u2019s investigation, which he does with hunches and leads, rather than guns and fists. \n\nNormally, I say that characters work best when they interact with others around them.  Liam Neeson is definitely a \u2018lone wolf\u2019 here and I actually preferred him that way.  However, the film-makers decided to make him \u2018play off\u2019 a young homeless kid he sort of befriends along the way.  I felt that this was the one down point in the film.  It wasn\u2019t the young actor\u2019s fault.  He could definitely act, I just didn\u2019t really believe a young homeless boy would be so into the things he was, i.e. health conscious and water-drinking to \u2018flush out his system\u2019 etc.  But he\u2019s comparatively a minor part of the two-hour film.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re in the mood for something a little slower than Neeson\u2019s recent offerings then give it ago.  Just think \u2018cops and robbers\u2019 rather than all out action.",
