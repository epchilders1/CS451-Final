    "text": "Wasn't expecting much going into this film since it was something I was only putting on for thematic purposes but found myself pleasantly surprised. I did have some problems with it such as a telegraphed Chekhov's Skill and red herrings being a bit too blatant but overall, Thanksgiving is a surprisingly fun slasher film. Characters who don't exist solely as cannon fodder for the main antagonist, a genuinely good villain who comes up with some memorably disturbing death scenes* (and is willing to feed a cat before he resumes unaliving people) and quite a few funny moments. And yes, the most disturbing scene in a film about a Thanksgiving killer was the Black Friday prologue since, as exaggerated as it might be, I am well aware of how riots such as these have panned out in real life. And I've gotta give a film credit for at least trying to give some of the killer's victims a fighting chance, as the film finds the right balance between making him an effective threat but not having him overpowered. For instance, he finds out that tranquilliser darts don't affect everyone exactly the same way, even if all it does is merely postpone the inevitable. Yep, with how enjoyable this film is, even feeling at times more like an homage to the Scream and Scream-type horror flicks of the '90s than to '80s slashers, it's safe to say that Thanksgiving is no turkey...I'll see myself out.\n*don't show this film to Armie Hammer! One specific scene might turn him on!",

The beginning was terrible, but I think the worst part was that it was set in modern times-- namely with phones and social media. All that teen lingo they used, and all the iphone things ruined it. Could have been much cooler. And no, this did not capture or feel like Grindhouse.",

But Roth knows how to use the terms of it. He\u2019s a greater director and can\u2019t wait to see what he does next. This year, there will be no leftovers!!!",

    "text": "If it is fall and you want to watch a fall horror movie this is the one you should watch (then 2nd place would be \u201cBlood Rage\u201d). \u201cThanksgiving is the perfect horror movie to watch for Thanksgiving. The kills are amazing, gruesome, and gory not to spoil, but I will just say that on kill is really close to what you do to a turkey on Thanksgiving. The story is great, it and a lot like \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d just taking place on and around thanksgiving. So if you like those movies and/or just who-done-it movies in general you will enjoy this movie a lot. The reveal is good the killer was not even close to who I was expecting. The motive is also good and surprising and I did not expect the killer\u2019s motive to be what it was. This is a great movie to watch in November and on Thanksgiving.",

Love Eli Roth\u2019s creativity and premise of the entire film. Some decisions are stupid, just like in every who is the killer movie .
