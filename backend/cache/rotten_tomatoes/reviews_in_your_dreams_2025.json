In fact it features strong emotions and scary imagery which can scare children without offering hope. I so regret watching this my 8yo and 10yo kids. Irresponsible filmmaking at its worst.",

I was also really touched by the dynamics between the siblings and the family as a whole. Beyond the great story, the animation was just flawless. I'd highly recommend it for families to watch with their kids, but as we proved, it's also a genuinely enjoyable for a bunch of grown-ups as well.",

    "text": "i\u2019m barely 20 minutes into this movie and it is already annoying AF. Once again, we are adultifying young girls, requiring them to hold the family together while the mother is away. The fact that the mother tells her daughter that she is \"in charge\" while mom goes away on a weekend trip is terrible parenting. Why isn\u2019t the father in charge? Oh that\u2019s right\u2014 it\u2019s because the mother is fully aware that she married a child man. Why can\u2019t we raise adult males who actually take care of their children? We keep making these tropes, pretending they\u2019re funny when they\u2019re not. The little girl should not be in charge of her little brother; she should be living a life that is her choice. It is making a terrible imbalanced sibling relationship and creating resentment. The father is A child an adult clothing who has never grown up. He cannot get over the fact that his music career is a failure and The talent actually lay in his wife. He doesn\u2019t want to admit that he needs to go out there and actually support his family in someway rather than sitting at home dreaming of past glory all day. Why do we keep creating boys who cannot support their families? Because we keep allowing them to live their entitled privileged little dreams, way far into adulthood. He should be the one supporting the family over the weekend not his daughter. don\u2019t get me started on the little boy who is allowed keep his side of the room in a disgusting state. Baloney on the floor? The fact that the parents do nothing to discipline him and treat him like he is a golden child who can do no wrong is even worse. We expect so much of our girls and so little of our boys. If the girl came home with less than A\u2019s, the parents would probably freak out. Yet the boy can strive for C level grades and that\u2019s OK? The little girl feels so much pressure to keep the family together and the little boy coasts because \"boys will be boys\". I am so tired of media making these things OK. We have been laying the blame for all of society\u2019s ills on women for so long. It\u2019s creating a terrible society. Boys need to grow up into men. We have generations of men who are nothing but little boys.",

    "text": "If you\u2019ve been waiting for an animated feature that captures the emotional intelligence of early Pixar but delivers it with a fresh, distinctively modern visual language, Netflix\u2019s In Your Dreams is the wake-up call you didn\u2019t know you needed.\n\nDirected by Alex Woo and Erik Benson, this film is far more than a standard \"save the family\" caper. It is a masterclass in visual storytelling, using the limitless logic of the dream world to explore the very real, very messy dynamics of a family on the brink of change.\n\nA Colorist\u2019s Playground For those of us who live in the grade, In Your Dreams is an absolute feast. The filmmakers didn\u2019t just use color to make things look pretty; they used it as the primary narrative engine. The film establishes a brilliant visual dichotomy between the waking world\u2014grounded, slightly muted, naturalistic\u2014and the dreamscapes, which explode with saturation and intentionality.\n\nThe transition into \"Breakfast Town\" is a standout sequence, bathed in warm, syrup-gold hues and vibrant primaries that feel nostalgic without being saccharine. But the real genius lies in the film\u2019s darker moments. As the dream curdles into a nightmare, the grade shifts aggressively. The palette doesn't just dim; it desaturates into cold cyans and bruising purples, draining the \"life\" out of the image in a way that feels visceral. \n\nHeart Over Hype Narratively, the film rests on the shoulders of siblings Stevie (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport) and Elliot (Elias Janssen). Their journey to find the Sandman to \"fix\" their parents' marriage avoids the cloying tropes of the genre. Instead, it offers a surprisingly mature look at how children process grief and instability.\n\nThe supporting cast is electric, particularly Craig Robinson as Baloney Tony. In lesser hands, a talking stuffed giraffe could have been the film's \"Jar Jar,\" but Robinson imbues him with such genuine warmth (and perfect comedic timing) that he becomes the film\u2019s beating heart.\n\nThe Verdict In Your Dreams manages to be that rare thing: a technical marvel that never lets the tech overshadow the soul of the story. It is a film about the necessity of nightmares\u2014how the scary stuff helps us process the waking world.\n\nVisually stunning, emotionally resonant, and beautifully paced, this is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen (or the best-calibrated monitor) you have.",

A memorable family movie night thanks to a story that captivated all of us and inspired ideas of what sibling relationships can look like.
