    "text": "The themes and style are unoriginal, but it's an enjoyable watch. Discovering this world alongside the lead is captivating; you too want to find out what happened and how this universe works. Sadly, the film's mechanics are too obvious as it relies on the whimsy of the visuals and premise but neglects to focus on the characters and emotional stakes: the romance feels obligatory, the climactic action scene is a clunky mess, the parents just disappear, and even the closure with Grandpa is hasty.",

When Abe is murdered in his house in Florida and has his eyes removed, Jake sees a monster and his parents take him to a psychologist. Jake asks to go to Wales to visit the orphanage and his psychologist agrees. His father Franklin Portman (Chris O'Dowd) travels with him to Wales and Jake discovers that the orphanage was bombed in 1943 by the Germans. When he decides to visit the ruins of the orphanage again, Abe finds a girl and soon he learns that the orphanage, the headmaster Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) and the children still exist trapped in a time loop. But they are in danger since monsters are hunting them down. And Jake has the gift of seeing monsters. What will Jake do?\n\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" is a delightful original adventure directed by Tim Burton. The fantasy is a sort of X-Men and is highly entertaining with lovely characters and evil villains. Tim Burton\u2019s creativity once again is amazing. Despite the confused idea of time loops, the film entertains adults and children. My vote is eight.  \nTitle (Brazil): \"O Orfanato da Srta. Peregrine Para Crian\u00e7as Peculiares\" (\"The Orphanage of Miss Peregrine for Peculiar Children\")\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",

Logical inconsistencies and overlooked details\u2014especially regarding time-travel consequences\u2014detract from the story\u2019s believability. Despite its flaws, the film remains an enjoyable watch for fantasy lovers, though it leaves room for improvement in storytelling depth.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com) and  (English version : uwiepuspita.com)",

    "text": "One of my favorites. Maybe it\u2019s just me getting older, but I really enjoy throwbacks to simpler stories\u2014family, overcoming adversity, good vs. evil. Too often, movies feel like they\u2019re trying too hard to be \u201crelevant\u201d or, at worst, end up pandering. Real life is already real enough; movies should take us away from that and simply entertain. And Tim Burton\u2019s visuals? Absolutely stunning.",

Not only is the movie generally not intriguing, but so much is changed from the fun book. Jacob and his grandfather's jewish ancestry is a huge and important part of the story, but it was completely erased from the movie. Not at all surprising considering it was directed by Tim Burton. Characters were switched around, Jacob is boring, Emma is boring, Miss Peregrine feels like a different character. So much is different from the book, which is a great read, which makes this film utterly disappointing.",

I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the villains who are a little disappointing and without much depth behind them, but I would give it 5 stars, but for the villains I give it 5 and a half stars.",
