    "text": "A poorly executed, 'ticking the boxes' holiday flick falling flat whenever it attempts to build any form of tension, romantic or otherwise. \n\nBella is a flat, uninspired and hollow protagonist with neither edges nor flaws, nor any character development to speak of. With the exception of her relationship status, she ends the movie as she started it. That lack of character is, fundamentally, what contributes to any sort of chemistry between Bella and the Duke.\n\nIt would be expected that at least her male counterpart would undertake some sort of character development, but no. \"Duke Stefan Brown\" has himself very little in the way of character to develop; at the very least, he came pre-packaged with an unpleasant breakup and a tragic family history. And while, to his credit, he does change over the course of a very, very long 1.5 hours, that change is formulaic rather than earned. There are no profound or emotionally charged moments - character development is told and explained, not shown or felt.\n\nThe story does precious little to change any of that. The plot is expectedly predictable, and not without a bit of Christmas spirit in the shape of a surprisingly gracious paparazzo. Fortunately, in this case, that also means it takes no suprising turns, making it an entirely inconsequential piece of holiday entertainment.\n\nAdd to that an overall cheap and tacky feel - visibly dirty floors, cheap-looking suits, an overabundance of all-too-obviously-fake fake snow, not the faintest touch of believable royalty - and rapid, jumpy cuts in conversations. Then sprinkle in every clich\u00e9 imaginable, and you're left with a film that feels disjointed and uninspired for much of its runtime.\n\nThe saving grace here is low expectations: You don't start this film expecting a masterpiece, so the disappointment doesn't hit all that hard. There is almost a feeling of relief once the credits roll.",

    "text": "Filme: Um Amor Real de Natal\t\t\t\tAssistido: 28-12-24\nElenco: @damonrun @danicamckellar @vpapavs @goodman.patrice \nModelo: #natal #romance \nDura\u00e7\u00e3o: 1h 27m \tAno: 2023\nMinha opini\u00e3o: Um filme natalino j\u00e1 conhecido o roteiro. De um nobre com Rapunzel ou Ciderela ou gata Borralheira. E aqui \u00e9 este conto de Natal que vimos j\u00e1 uma dezena de vezes e que n\u00e3o se can\u00e7amos de assistir em todo per\u00edodo de Natal. Temos uma rep\u00f3rter que vai fazer um trabalho com duque e onde o amor florece. Onde o cora\u00e7\u00e3o g\u00e9lido do duque vai descongelando e descongelando. E o amor no final brilha. Com boa fotografia natalina o filme corre como um filme B ou C. Com interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es medianas. Com final feliz.\nRoteiro e enredo j\u00e1 conhecido. E que mant\u00e9m o espirito natalino. \nVale apena assistir? Sim no Natal.\nNota: Filme: A) 5 B) 7 C) 8",

Unlike a lot of the Hallmark Movies, Now that they have gotten so family unfriendly. Danica, McKellar and Damon Runyon did an excellent job in mass. Yes I highly recommend it James Welch, Henderson Arkansas November 25, 2023.",
