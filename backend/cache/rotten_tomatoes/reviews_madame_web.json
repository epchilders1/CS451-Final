There is no reason why the bad guy would have a \"Spiderman\" costume if there is no Spiderman in this world. The acting was not great very little face movement or depth. You do not need to watch this film, as I would of had a better time washing up than watching this.",

I would definitely recommend it, also makes sense how the movie has so many views on streaming, people seem to be enjoying it.",

    "text": "Far from perfect, but far from the disaster you\u2019ve heard about.\n\nMadame Web arrived with a thud\u2014one of those films whose reputation seemed pre-written long before audiences even bought their tickets. And yes, let\u2019s be honest: the plot zigzags like a spider with a caffeine problem, the dialogue can feel like it's been imported from an early-2000s superhero draft folder, and the tone sometimes shifts so abruptly you wonder if a different director briefly took the wheel.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: despite the noise, Madame Web is\u2026 fun. Genuinely fun. It\u2019s a straightforward, big-swing, popcorn superhero romp that never pretends to be anything else. If you sit back with your brain set to \"weekend mode,\" there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nDakota Johnson brings an unexpectedly dry, deadpan energy that keeps the film buoyant, and the trio of future Spider-heroes have a charming, chaotic chemistry that feels like it belongs in a more warmly received franchise. Meanwhile, the action sequences\u2014though not groundbreaking\u2014are brisk, colourful, and pleasantly self-aware.\n\nIs it flawed? Absolutely. Is it the cinematic apocalypse the internet declared? Absolutely not.\n\nMadame Web ends up being the kind of movie you watch with popcorn in hand, laugh at the messy bits, enjoy the good bits, and leave thinking, \"Well, that was better than Twitter said it\u2019d be.\" Sometimes, that\u2019s more than enough.",

Am I giving it 5 stars...no 5 stars from me you have to undermine our social views and change us for that...and that can be an incredible thing. However I will say strait up people say the acting sucks....it does not, they have to come up at such a fast pace, at possibly a genre that rhey do not know......look what that did to heath ledger. Secondly they are trying to tell a story mostly to people that are missing a lot of the context. Look at the introduction of sentinel. Must people dont even know who he really is...or is supposed to be in mcu. Yes I dont know everything,  but I'm over half a century old and have been following most comics most of my life. Epic, First, Dark Horse! (And hell yea Dark Horse) this movie went levels most marvel movies wouldn't dare...yea even you Mr.Deadpool. it was entertaining,  I would take my children to it...they are young men now! We would enjoy it, and we would talk about it. I feel the real gorilla in rhe room is cgi. Yes CGI, and I will bring that up in my next rant coming soon! All you comic book officinados complaining about cgi now think about the fact we didn't see this Shiz outside of comic books 20 or 30 years ago.....and Check yourself! I have spoken! My favorite hero when I was 14 was The Badger. My favorite hero in my 20s was Eek the Cat, and anyone doesn't realise he's a hero should have just skipped this post! The world's going to heck and we hate cgi!",

The story pulled me in, the acting was great, and the energy stayed strong all the way through. The ending actually hit in a way I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nI also love that it\u2019s an all-women team beating ass and holding their own. It felt powerful without trying too hard\u2014just natural, confident energy. I\u2019d definitely love to see a sequel that builds on this world and gives these characters even more room to shine.\n\nSometimes we just need to watch movies without expecting them to fit a formula. That\u2019s when you actually see the magic in them.",
