    "text": "Stunning and deeply disturbing in the best way\u2014Rose Byrne gives a career-best performance as Linda, a therapist/mother whose life collapses under her daughter\u2019s illness and endless pressure. You feel every ounce of her frustration, exhaustion, and rage; the way she lashes out at everyone (husband, doctors, even her own therapist) is painfully real. Beautifully made, psychologically intense, and so raw it almost hurts to watch. Only downsides: the dream-vs-reality blur can be confusing, and it\u2019s definitely not for everyone\u2014mostly hits home for women (or people close to women) who\u2019ve felt this kind of overwhelming burden. Still, an easy 9/10 for me.",

    "text": "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is a searing portrait of motherhood under pressure. It's at times an unsettling watch, but absolutely a worthwhile one. Linda is a young mother with a young child. Her daughter has an eating disorder, so every day is a struggle to keep her going. So much so, that she needs a tube at night to keep her weight up. Linda also works full time. She is a therapist. But because of her struggles she also seeks therapy. Linda also has an absent  husband. He is often away for work and when he calls he is overly critical of her. To top it off leaking water has blown a hole in their bedroom ceiling, so mother and daughter have moved into a motel temporarily. This creates a maelstrom of pressure for Linda. The film effectively looks at the struggles of motherhood and how the pressure to cope can be very overwhelming. As you might imagine this makes for a sometimes stressful watch, as we follow Linda and her struggles. But ultimately it works, as the film feels so real and honest. The film was written and directed by Mary Bronstein and she has created a great work of cinema. She is aided by a truly superb performance by Rose Byrne. She embodies every detail of struggle for the beset Linda. This is a substantive work. Although never an easy watch, it's definitely a vital and important film.",

Rose Byrne gives the performance of a lifetime - and if not picked up by the Academy for a nomination, she will have been snubbed unjustifiably. A love letter to moms, and especially those who struggle daily with mental health an anxiety. It's a tough one to get through, but with an ending so rewarding and hopeful, it makes up for the virtual house of terror we're asked to sit through for two hours. Outstanding work!!!",
