    "text": "This film was mediocre. Not that bad, but not good. It had some good plot parts - the 'romance' between Margo and Niko was very funny, as was the Lucy learning to be a parent part, or even Dru stealing lollipops. And Bratt was a pretty good 80s-themed villain. The music was great, too. However, all in all, the plot is bloated, and full of some not-so-good parts. I would recommend this film to people who don't mind there being multiple subplots, which I am not a fan of when it isn't done right.",

    "text": "Despicable Me 3 is a curious entry in what is undeniably one of the most dynamic animated franchises of recent decades. Gru and the minions have become cultural icons, capturing audiences worldwide with their humor, quirks, and heartwarming arcs. The first two films established a formula that worked brilliantly \u2014 Gru\u2019s transformation from villain to father, the girls\u2019 charm, and, of course, the chaotic brilliance of the minions.\n\nUnfortunately, the third installment feels like a misstep in several ways. The story introduces Gru\u2019s long-lost twin brother, a premise with obvious comedic potential, yet the execution falls flat. The narrative leans heavily into exposition and convoluted plot points, leaving many of the more genuinely funny or chaotic moments feeling diluted. While the concept of exploring family dynamics is commendable, it doesn\u2019t carry the same magical rhythm established in the earlier films or even the minion spinoffs, which thrive on over-the-top antics.\n\nThe screenplay seems overly focused on Gru himself, which is understandable given his central role, but it does so at the expense of the minions \u2014 the true engine of the franchise\u2019s popularity. The minions\u2019 mischief, their slapstick humor, and their unpredictable energy are what consistently draw audiences, yet here, they feel secondary. The balance is off; the film attempts to juggle too many characters and subplots, ultimately leaving the minions\u2019 chaos underutilized.\n\nPierre Coffin, co-director and voice of the minions, clearly worked to craft a story that he enjoyed, but it feels like the attention to franchise dynamics and audience expectations wasn\u2019t fully prioritized. Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, and the rest of the cast continue to deliver strong vocal performances, imbuing their characters with life, charm, and comedic timing. However, the script and focus simply don\u2019t let the cast shine as fully as they could.\n\nAt its heart, Despicable Me 3 is a well-intentioned film with flashes of brilliance, but it lacks the punch, cohesion, and minion-driven energy that made the franchise a worldwide phenomenon. Even with strong performances and DreamWorks\u2019 signature animation quality, it doesn\u2019t quite reach the heights of its predecessors. For fans of Gru, it\u2019s worth a watch, but for those hoping for minion-centric chaos and the pure joy that made the first films unforgettable, it\u2019s a noticeable letdown.",

    "text": "Pretty major step down from the first two. The concept that was developed in the first 20 minutes was fine, but nothing special. But then like the next 40 minutes were just the characters hanging out, not doing much. Then the last 30 minutes ended up being the resolution from the plot at the beginning. The lack of minions to the main plot also didn't help much. Even the comedy wasn't as top notch as the last two. Sure I laughed a few times, but not as much as before. Even the antagonist wasn't as interesting. Any kid will still enjoy this, and I'd recommend to any young Despicable Me fan, but now that I can properly judge movies and point out issues, this one was full of them.",
