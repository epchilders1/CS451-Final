The main character was perfect for this role as a young modern real-world agent. I can't believe there are no sequels or a TV series - a huge missed opportunity!",

    "text": "American assassin is about a man named Mitch rapp . He is with his girlfriend and they are vacationing  and spending time on the beach . However that comes to an end when a group of terrorists show up and they start shooting people at the beach . Mitch ends up being one of the few survivors and when he goes looking for his girlfriend  she's dead . A year or two later he's recruited to a secret agency and he ends up working for the agency full time . But first he's got to go through training before ending up  on the field saving peoples lives , finding out secret information and getting the bad guys killed or capturing the bad guys .  Daniel O'Brien does a good job at portraying Mitch rapp and Micheal Keaton as his man boss does train him well  and does seem to beleible boss . Also the lady in the film ( sanaa  lathan ) does a decent job as the other boss . The plot of the movie could've been worked on a bit more though. Overall this was a good action movie that doesn't get enough credit or love .  But it's not on the level of Terminator 2 at all . 3 out of 5 \n\nParents guide/ Christian perspective \nViolence : heavy. Lots of punching and kicking . Terriorts shoot and kill innocent people. Scenes where a dead body is found in the trunk of a car .  Mitch rapp shoots at bad guys and they shoot back .  Chase science where he goes through a woman's house and is chasing the bad guy . I believe he jumps out the window . \nLanguage :moderate. 1 JC word , 4 or 5 gds . Use of the f word , s word and possibly hell and damn said a few times and 1 or 2 sobs . \nNudity : light. 1 woman gets out of the shower her breasts are briefly visible . \nDrugs : none",

American Assassin was a 'Greatest Hits' of this genre. Keaton is fantastic as is Dylan O'Brien. The ending is unexpected - action is great and like most Hollywood Films they create many script short cuts and yes some of it is ridiculous.  The critics hate it but who cares for a film like American Assassin.  2 boxes of Popcorn - 2 or 3 beers and pause it when you go to the bathroom. I actually liked American Assassin a lot.",

The dialogue and the progression of events are often hard to swallow and even harder to stomach.  Any number of aging heroes would have made sense for this movie... Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Dame.... but how they got Michael Keaton involved is beyond me. But, it was the only reason I gave the generically titled movie a try.",
