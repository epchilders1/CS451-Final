If you like watching Youtubers make terrible decisions in order to get content for their channel, especially of the abandoned places or ghost-hunter-type variety, then you will likely enjoy this film. It's not too complicated of a plot. But it was fun to watch.",

    "text": "Very original idea, excellent cinematography and a very strange movie. You might recognize a young Mick Jagger as one of the two stars of this very unique film that certainly does a superb job setting an atmosphere of unexpected surrealism... About halfway through the movie is when it becomes apparent the movie is a horror movie.... The back story could have emphasized more about the origin and history of the house but like the ending, it's left up to the audience to form their own conclusions.... I don't like that tactic with a good movie and a very good original plot but such is life .....\n\n4 1/2 stars \ud83e\udd29 \ud83e\udd29 \ud83e\udd29 \ud83e\udd29 \ud83e\udd29",

    "text": "I found the critics of this film to be pretty accurate on the dialogue and some questionable acting / actions by the cast.  While the film obviously had a limited budget , it did NOT lack in quality atmosphere !!   I am one of those few folks that love the horror genre - even tho it is ubiquitous with terrible films , terrible acting and well...terrible effects.  I always lower my standards for low-budget horror and sign on just to enjoy the ride.  This film really sets itself apart from other low-budget horror and truly shines in its creepy atmosphere , subtle visual clues and impending sense of dread.  The way some of things that are wrong in the scenes shows some serious directing talent...everything is not just handed to you.  You have to pay attention to the details in the scenes building up to the reveal to get a true sense of this movie's worth-a-watch quality.  Sure , like almost all horror movies , this one will not win any Hollywood awards or recognition...but if a creep-building and attention-rewarding movie is your style - you can not go wrong with this one.  It is just different and well-done enough to have bothered my peaceful sleep for several weeks after watching it...in a good way !!",

If the answer is yes then 2021's 'The Deep House' is the film for you.\n\nSYNOPSIS: 'While diving in a remote French lake, a couple who specialize in urban exploration videos discover a house submerged in deep waters. Their dive turns into a nightmare when they discover the house was the scene of atrocious crimes.'\n\nThis is certainly one way to take a different stab at the old haunted house horror story. A film which will leave you quite literally breathless.\n\nThe underwater settings play at my anxieties already and once you add in some terrifying horror sequences this film was definitely onto a winner.\n\nUnfortunately the performances of the limited cast  and narrative intentions really let this film down. The film needed more, it deserved more.\n\nThe ending hints at a sequel, a sequel I hope we don't ever see. This is better as a one off.\n\nLots of potential which ends up being a soggy disappointment.\n\n6/10",

    "text": "All in all I think it's worth giving a try, not exceptional but I still liked it. The vibe of the movie reminded me a bit of Blair Witch with it's creative use of cameras, cinematography and explorative premise. The acting, characters, and plot was all middle of the road. The story felt a little rushed and the acting towards the end fell off a little. \n\nWhat really saved it for me was the setting, the movie did a great job making a spooky atmosphere and I really enjoyed how much tension it created with closed in rooms and the suspense of waiting to see what was next through the drone's lense. The sprinkled in jumpscares worked, if you've got some fear of things lurking in murky water like me you'll definitely have chills. The shots of the antagonists swimming around were really interesting, not super scary but satisfying enough for it to still be a good horror movie. Lack luster ending, but the creativity of it's setting and general premise slightly makes up for the meh everything else.",
