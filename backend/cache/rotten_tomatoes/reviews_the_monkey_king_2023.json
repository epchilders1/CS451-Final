That's my own loving opinion!",

Somewhat okay?\nThere isn't almost a single minute where he isn't fighting.\nIt's full of cliches. \nIt's very colorful. It's silly and goofy. \nIt was actually a somewhat good movie until it reached the climax. \nOverall. I liked it. I'll watch it again someday. And I'm looking forward to giving the next movie a try.",

The good mix of animation styles and quick pacing can't hide the shallow, nonsensical plot and inconsistent ideas.  The musical number towards the end was good, but the choice to use \u2018metal' music was bizarre and overall, I found it tiring rather than enjoyable.",
