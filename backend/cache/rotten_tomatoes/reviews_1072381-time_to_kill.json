    "text": "This is probably a case of not aging well, but this is so obnoxiously Hollywood. The script is pretty bland, in spite of the setup being interesting. It gets fantastical and a little clich\u00e9, however. The performances are good and it\u2019s a solid movie, just not special, at least not by today\u2019s standards. The story does hit intense, moving beats at times, though.\n\nThe big famous line in the climax though is an absolute banger. Easily the best writing in the whole thing. But it's just one line (with a great build up to it).\n\nWeirdly, it feels set way before the '80s, and most characters come off like caricatures, cartoony even. The scenes of black protestors versus the KKK rioters is so exaggerated, serving to smooth the edges of racial hatred that should feel extremely raw and volatile and ugly. Very Hollywood, very palatable, perhaps except for the opening scene, which is a hard watch. But then, of course, everything wraps up with a neat happy ending and the bad guys *finally(?)* getting arrested after the court hearing (why they waited, no clue). Tie the bow, roll credits.",

I was super impressed by everyone\u2019s performances, especially Matthew McConaughey\u2014his courtroom scene at the end actually brought me to tears. I\u2019m not sure how realistic the trial part was, but that didn\u2019t really matter to me. As a viewer, I cared more about how the story made me feel, and it really hit hard. I also wasn\u2019t sure how realistic it was that people were so open about being in the KKK, but maybe that\u2019s just how it was in Mississippi. Either way, that part didn\u2019t bother me too much\u2014it just made me think. Samuel L. Jackson and Sandra Bullock were both amazing too. This movie had so many powerful and emotional moments. I\u2019d definitely watch it again and recommend it to my friends and family. Easily a 5 out of 5 for me.",

It felt like each character was cheated out of any development to advance the story. The re-writing of the closing argument compared to the book made for a quick and illogical ending. Lots of fine actors wasted in what could have been a great movie.",
