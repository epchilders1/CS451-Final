So we\u2019ve watched it multiple times over 3 years now and the kids still love it.  And, paradoxically it gets better every time we see it.  I don\u2019t mind it now and even think it\u2019s kind of cute at times..",

My 9 year old niece and my mum both really liked it - they liked the way it was colourized, and they thought it was funny, and they liked the location. I hated it, I thought it was terrible, I hated the way it was colourized, I didn't like the jokes, I thought the location was pretty cool. I just wasn't in the target audience and that's ok!",

They seem so basic and amateurish; probably afraid to upset anyone should they do anything different or remotely funny that could be classed as entertaining. This movie is no exception, it should be named Christmas Cringe. Nothing to see here folks, move on!",

It made no sense, the story just did not flow together.  The kids were cute, and performed admirably, but the adults were so all over the place that if they had been removed, I would have probably been able to watch it till the end.  I'm sure that it was meant to be over the top strange, but to strange for me to open the Holiday season.",
