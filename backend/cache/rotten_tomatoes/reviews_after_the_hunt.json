    "text": "I liked it overall. It was very slow and hard to get into. The music and the metronome are awful at times. It is so dark & often blurry- it's hard to see what is happening and it causes eye strain.  I watched it for free on Amazon. At times it felt a bit contrived and confusing but the acting was great and it portrayed the current insanity of academia very well imo. Some parts felt manipulative such as not explaining exactly what the facts were. So many are terrified to speak out about the current state of affairs.\n\n Julia Roberts looked terrible which I assume was due to being very ill with improperly treated ulcers. I was suspicious of the student who was snooping in her professor's house the day after she was accused of plagiarism. It seemed like she planned the whole event however this was never confirmed. There were zero consequences for the plagiarism and she smeared everyone. It's scary to see the caliber of all who are running and attending the elite schools as portrayed in this film. \n\n4 not believable manipulations: Student snoops and accuses both professors after plagiarizing is confronted but we're expected to trust her, professor is implied to attack JR also so he must have attacked student, JR steals rx- she would have gone to her husband or doctor for rx and treatment, JR becomes dean after all of it, maybe but probably not. \n\nThe accused professor is never heard from again until JR and student meet up 5 years later, he became a political consultant making big bucks- he would've sued probably at the time though. The moral of the story is have cameras in your home everywhere and never socialize with or  be alone with anyone at your employment.",

From the awkward music that is fighting for your attention to the constant feeling that you inadvertently missed a few chapters, the whole thing was giving Lifetime movie network at 3am.",

I randomly clicked on this movie and didn't know . it does make me wonder what director Luca\"s other films are like.tbe acting was good but Should you watch it ? its not for the faint of heart . you might watch it anyway if you are a Julia fan .The ending is confusing . it seems they both won ...but at the same time am left feeling confused.",
