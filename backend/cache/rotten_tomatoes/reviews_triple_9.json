Both during and after, I still don't know what triple 9 means, and I'm too lazy to even look it up. Had this movie been something completely different, it could have been awesome.",

    "text": "Imagine you have one of the most amazing casts ever ensembled. And your writers are fantastic at writing scenes. But wouldnt know a plot if it hit them in the face. That's this movie. It has amazing scene after scene but it seems to have been plotted and put together by a 12 year old. Nearly everyone in this movie is .. flat out evil. How this director managed to get people to hand him the money to hire a cast like this is hard to fathom. It tries to steal the scenes/feeling from movies like Heat and Training day but the director/producers/writers arent remotely in that league. Not worth watching other than for the actors performances",

There are some good moments, but the film does waste a lot of the ensemble cast. Aaron Paul in particular doesn't get much to work with. Beyond that, Casey Affleck feels horribly miscast in his role. His performance nearly single handedly ruined this movie for me. Everyone else was pretty good, even if they didn't get much to work with.",

    "text": "\"Triple 9\" boasts a star-studded ensemble that should have made it an action classic, but alas, it falls short on several fronts. The cast is filled with A-listers, and the acting is undeniably top-notch. However, the movie's biggest problem is that it tries to juggle too many characters, leaving the audience struggling to connect the dots.\n\nThe plot is as thin as a supermodel's diet plan, making it hard to follow at times. You find yourself yearning for more action scenes and heists, but they are disappointingly sparse. The lack of emotional connection with the characters makes it difficult to invest in their fates. It's like watching a well-choreographed dance without caring about the dancers.\n\nIn the end, \"Triple 9\" feels like a missed opportunity. With its fantastic cast and potential for thrilling action, it could have been a knockout. Unfortunately, it delivers a few punches but fails to land the knockout blow.",
