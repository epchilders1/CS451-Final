    "text": "Unhinged was truly that, a story of an unhinged maniac. Russell Crowe plays a bloodthirsty killer having a REALLY bad week. Nothing unlike other cat and mouse type crime movies Unhinged mostly delivers on its basic implied promises. Car chases, intense action, and nail biting moments, this movie ruly leaves you on the edge of your seat and gets your heart pumping. Crowe, as always plays his role excellently as he creates a believable character for you. The other acting throughout the film isn't the greatest but it's good enough to keep you immersed. The movie doesn't try and be more than it isn't and that's why I didn't dislike the film. It delivers on the genre's promise and will be a nice action movie night option.",
