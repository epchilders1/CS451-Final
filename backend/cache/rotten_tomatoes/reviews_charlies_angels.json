A stacked cast with Sam Rockwell, Tom Green, Luke Wilson, and Crispin Glover??? Plus one of the best soundtracks, packed with banger after banger.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

    "text": "Charlie's Angels might not be perfect, but I still enjoy it every time I watch it. Sure, there's an overemphasis on style, and it has its gratuitous moments, but honestly, it works. The over-the-top action, comedy, and wittiness complement the movie's tone. It's not trying to be a replica of the original series; instead, it's doing its own thing, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nThe direction is solid, and the plot is simple enough to follow without overcomplicating things. The cinematography has its highs, with some memorable scenes, though the frequent use of slow motion and close-ups can feel unnecessary. That said, they don't hurt the movie-they just add to its flashy, unique vibe.\n\nThe acting isn't bad either. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu bring a lot of energy and charm to their roles, and I like how the movie feels like it's always on the move. The characters are all over the place (in a good way), which gives the film its own signature style.\n\nOverall, Charlie's Angels is a fun, flashy action-comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's entertaining, energetic, and definitely worth a watch if you're in the mood for something lighthearted and over-the-top. It might not be groundbreaking, but it's undeniably fun!",

    "text": "Charlie\u2019s Angels dives into action and comedy with a standout cast. Although it\u2019s from the 2000s, the film is an example of how entertainment can be both smart and carefree. Despite a clich\u00e9d hide-and-seek narrative, it\u2019s the execution that keeps it light. The visual aesthetic and a memorable soundtrack complement the action sequences with choreography and absurdity. While the plot falls into the trap of exaggeration, Charlie\u2019s Angels makes up for it with elegant and playful self-irony. It\u2019s not a deep film, but it\u2019s undoubtedly an experience that delivers quality entertainment and laughs.",

    "text": "It's ok overall. It's very dated. The acting is actually not that bad with a lot of quirky energy and actually some good chemistry between the three angels at times. But the characters are one dimensional and a lot of the supporting cast is just ok even Bill Murray who doesn't really have any charm or wit (Which isn't his fault as it feels like most of the actors weren't given much here to work with). The jokes actually every now and then got a laugh out of me for how stupid they were but a lot also fell flat. The cinematography is decent also, the action scenes are surprisingly well done with a lot of practical effects and are all very over the top but are all entertaining and the ebay parts of the film. The soundtrack is a mix of the Charlie's Angels theme, dated 90's-00's pop songs, and generic action music which is ok enough but doesn't mix well because it's so dated. The editing is not that good and is the weakest part of the film. Certain jokes go on way too long, there are way too many scenes where it cuts to showing off the angel's bodies in exploitative borderline softcore porn ways and the non action parts are not that good overall. The pacing is ok as stated before the action scenes save this film from being terrible. Overall it's honestly entertaining enough. Anyone who is a fan of any of these actors I would say give it a watch. Besides that though I would say skip it.",

It was hilarious, and the action scenes were a lot of fun. I had a blast watching it. Of the three Charlie's Angels movies that have been made, this is the only one worth watching. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was like a parody of a parody, and Elizabeth Banks' 2019 remake was just a sewer pickle with bad writing and disturbing rather than dark humor.",

The plot, such as it is, seems to be a series of SNL skits loosely tied together.  But the film is hard to dislike as it clearly is having so much fun at its own expense.  It is a fun movie as long as you don't take it seriously.",
