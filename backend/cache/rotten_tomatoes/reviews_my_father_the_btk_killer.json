    "text": "This Netflix documentary is all about her.  It is a nothingburger. \n\nThis probably appeals to a certain demographic, but it is essentially about BTK's whiney daughter.  Very boring. She's trying to make a living off of his story.  She's looks exactly like him and seems to be a narcissist.  Just go away Kerri.",

It was very dramatic, shocking, and sad. If you haven't seen this documentary yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",

Skye Borgman\u2019s pacing and archival work are solid, and Kerri Rawson\u2019s perspective gives it heart. If you want emotional fallout over fresh facts, it\u2019s worth a watch. Otherwise, it\u2019s fine, not essential.",

I suppose if you knew nothing about BTK it does cover the basics but that's about it. \nWhy is she estranged from her mother?\ndoes she speak to her brother?\nThey hinted at more discoveries with her help all through the doc but it was just nothing.",

    "text": "This was really well done. A sensitive portrayal of a person that's a victim in her own right, just trying to process and figure out how to move forward with a sense of self. Like many people with unhealthy family dynamics, a parent with secrets, and parents with mental illness, this shows someone coming to terms with who they are despite the person who she grew up with, and who she thought he was. It's unimaginable what it's like to live with that, but on a national scale, geez. I like that the victims families are also acknowledged, even if they didn't participate. \n\nWhen that neighbor yelled at her saying she doesn't have to go through this on a daily basis, was such an ignorant statement. I'm sure it's hard to live there, but she can move away and have no further association. No matter where Raders' family moves they are still his family, this affects every part of their lives, and will affect their children as well.",
