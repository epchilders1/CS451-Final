The movie moves along slowly interweaved by boring punching fights and a few lousy car chases. No spark, no ideas, no talent. The only passable thing is miles davis music, but even that is intercepted rather than played.",

Predictable. So many unrealistic elements. The idea of bricklaying is completely useless in this movie. It\u2019s not even a subplot\u2026hard factors into the story. It\u2019s so campy that part of me thought they have to know that and are embracing it? \n\nDecent action scenes to be fair. \n\nWithout Eckhart, this movie hurts.",

I mean, have you ever- I mean ever- seen anyone so handy with a trowel? The acting may have been appalling, the fight scenes ridiculous, but the trowel left me begging for more. After the movie I jumped online to see if I could retrain as a brickie.

The fight scenes were choreographed by an amateur modern dance troupe who thought they were in a middle school cafeteria food fight. There literally is nothing redeeming about this movie. Two hours of my life I\u2019ll never recover. A travesty because the book actually was pretty good.",
