I see the point it's trying to make but it moves at a plodding pace and it gets way too ridiculous to be taken seriously. In the end it's a waste",

    "text": "The Strays is a thriller that follows this woman who we first learn has a past that she's trying to escape from and this movie basically slowly informs us that past as it unravels and shows us the aftermath of the secrets behind this character who we know as Neve. I will be honest, this movie does start pretty slow at first as it seems Neve is hallucinating or is being driven insane by her past but when her secrets are revealed and we see the perspective of these other characters by the names of Carl and Abigail, the movie does get more interesting and suspenseful. The performances from Jordan Myrie and Bukky Bakray were really good, especially after the twist is revealed about their characters. Then, when the Final act starts, the movie really does shine and really keeps you invested as these two characters terrorize this family. The whole time you just start to really get disgusted at the main character now known as Cheryl as she's lied to her whole family, and then how the movie ends really has my jaw-dropped and it was just so nerve-wracking. Overall, The Strays is a pretty suspenseful thriller as the movie shines with the protagonist and the two antagonists while also giving us some gnarly visuals and the writing of some scenes I thought were clever and creative. The Strays gets a B-",

Come on.\nSad, very sad.\n\nWhatever, Madekwe is great, I found The Strays quite effective, but a little too much self-indulgent and lost the grip towards the end; Martello-White knows the job, I'm pretty sure he will find a balance in next movies.",

    "text": "More a drama about abandonment and neglect before irrationally transitioning into a home invasion thriller and picturing an unresolved cycle. Though layered, it's debatable whether that's intentional or it was lost whilst told aimlessly without a solid flow, therefore misleading and contextually insulting through a baselessly wrongful incompletion starring unlikable leads.
