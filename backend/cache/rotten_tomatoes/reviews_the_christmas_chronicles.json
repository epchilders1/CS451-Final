    "text": "The Christmas Chronicles, direceted by Clay Caytis and released on Nov 22, 2018 is a really great movie, because if we talk about Christmas movies this is genuinely one of the best ones.\nThe film is about the two siblings Kate and Teddy Pierce that were going to hatch a plan to capture Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. When the plan goes awry, the children join forces with St. Nicholas and his loyal elves to save the vacation before it's too late. \nThe plot actually seems very intriguing and sometimes predictable.\nFor the year in which the film was released, the special effects are not bad, that is, they are decent, as well as the photography and stuff.\nThe acting is definitely quite well worked, the expressions, the dialogues, the fluency in which they speak, definitely a great work! \nIn my opinion this may be one of the best Christmas movies I\u2019ve seen in a while, the plot is very emotional and joyful at the same time. \nI really like this movie because is basically made for almost all ages, and it\u2019s a solid option if you are going to watch it next to your family on a cold winter night at house.",

Kurt Russell plays an awesome Santa next to Tim Allen. The movie has its funny parts and sad parts. If you hate this movie to any degree, then you probably prefer coal on christmas or you just find absolutely no joy in christmas.",

In fact, the reason I'm writing this is bc we're watching it together right now. The sequel is also very cute. May be a good watch for a Kurt Russell or Goldie Hawn. They're a cute couple in the movie and IRL. Very enjoyable and it's not too silly for 33 yr old me to watch w my kiddo \ud83d\udc4c",
