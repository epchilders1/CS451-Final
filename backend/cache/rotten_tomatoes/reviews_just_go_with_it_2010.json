Recommended for fans of Sandler and Aniston seeking a low-stakes, entertaining watch.",

Each had a few good jokes here and there but overall the movie was boring and I was wishing I had \u201c50 First Dates\u201d or \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d on instead. The romance aspect saved the movie with the ending being a pretty good way of wrapping everything up. Overall I probably would not watch it again.",

I've watched this movie many times, and every time it's like the first time. I always watch in one breath. It is impossible to look away from the TV screen. This is my favorite comedy. Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life.",

I find it quite entertaining and the romance between Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler is actually quite sweet. It helps that a lot of it takes place in beautiful Hawaii, and I think that is my main reason for watching it again.",
