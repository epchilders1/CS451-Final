    "text": "I've been waiting for this film for three years. Unfortunately, it's very hard to love. The violence is surprisingly tame, and no murder is shown on screen. (Beware, Terrifier fans!) It's not even PG-13, it's borderline PG. The recent trend of making films as desaturated and bleak as possible has plagued Time Cut as well, which simply makes no sense since the 2000s were famously colorful to the point of tastelessness. The editing is another issue-it's too twitchy to ignore. The killer teleports so much even Jason Voorhees would get uncomfortable, and his mask is some Max Headroom knock-off. Most importantly, the script itself is so increasingly fatigued that the third act can only be described as anticlimactic and unsatisfactory.\n\nThe silver lining is that it has a variety of modern Canadian scream queens: Marina Stephenson Kerr (in a clearly reduced to blink-and-you'll-miss-it role; Channel Zero), Sydney Sabiston (All Fun and Games), Megan Best (Elevator Game) and Summer Howell (in what might be described as a cameo; Curse of Chucky). Alas, the lead actors didn't impress me that much. The soundtrack is decent and full of familiar songs of the era. The only truly satisfying thing might be the clothes-they were on-brand for the decade. The costume designer is arguably the only person involved who was actually invested in her job.\n\nAll and all, no matter how you look at Time Cut, it's just not enough. It lacks some of the vital skills of a horror film, such as being scary. It's not funny, it's not smart, it's not totally killer, and it's not even trendy. Ugh, as if!",

    "text": "Honestly, I was a pretty good movie up until the end... they ended it with way too many plot holes! They said that if Lucy saves Summer she would never have been born. But when she goes back to the future she still some how exists but her parents don't even know who she is... so she goes back to the past and lives there. How is she still existing if she doesn't even have any parents ? Her parents are apparently not even together! So she's an ophan with literally no biological parents? I don't understand... Anyways, when she goes back to the past, she tells the dude that she killed the slasher which was himself from the future and he's like, ok awesome, and then they end up being best friends. That was a little bit weird to me... But, also, why does the slasher not kill the bully, Ethan for throwing him in water if that was part of his problem with his life??\nIdk, the whole ending was just weird and confusing to me... fun movie, but too many questions.",
