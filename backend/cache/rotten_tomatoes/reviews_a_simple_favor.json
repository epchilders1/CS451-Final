    "text": "The chaotic nature of A Simple Favor works very well, as if a large cauldron of satirical characters, shocking plot twists, and a touch of dark humor were served on a fancy plate, standing out mainly thanks to the performances of Kendrick and Lively, a sharp duo who sink their claws into this plot which, whether you like it or not, may lean towards the revisited, but you won't know how it will end, no matter how hard you try, you will be surprised, and that's exciting.",

She spends the whole time with a puzzled look on her face, and has the whole plot spelled out for her at the end.\n\nComplaint #2: They never even mentioned why her mother wears a wig. Poor character development \n\nComplaint #3: Midway through the movie, out of right field, there's a dude jacking off in the shower, and not even in a comedic way. It was gross. WTF. No thanks.",

    "text": "A Simple Favor is a Gone Girl that takes itself less seriously and succeeds very well precisely because of this. Despite a \"small\" difference in the ending compared to the book, the movie remains faithful to the book on which it is based. Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively both give spectacular performances, especially Blake who (evidently) had a lot of fun playing her character.",

    "text": "A Simple Favour is not a comedy. The trailer was tonally deceptive but I'd argue that this is a thriller with more levity than usual compared to how self-serious films in a similar genre such as Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train are but having the main conflict taken seriously enough to avoid coming off as a spoof of the genre. Indeed, Paul Feig described in the BTS featurettes as a \"fun thriller\"...and I can't say I disagree. Maybe it borders on mood whiplash at times but A Simple Favour is a fun film with great performances from its leads, a few memorable side characters (or maybe I'm just biased because I like how Linda Cardellini looks here), a twisty story that has an enjoyably suspenseful climax and amusing comedic timing, even if it seems clear to me that Feig had to tone it down when compared to the pure comedies he makes with Melissa McCarthy. Not a perfect film but still a fairly enjoyable flick that by having a slightly-more-lighthearted-than-usual tone does something different from the angst-fests other missing-person thrillers can be.",

She had one good scene and the rest of the time I thought she would bust out laughing which did not fit the movie at all. Either poor acting or poor direction, take your pick.",

The twist was ridiculous, the acting wasn't great (even though none of these people are bad actors...I'm so confused lol). I feel like I wasted my time watching this, and being excited about it. What's with all the prolonged sequels that are so much worse than the original??? It was like watching third graders put on an impromptu play for you...things didn't make sense and it just wasn't funny lol",
