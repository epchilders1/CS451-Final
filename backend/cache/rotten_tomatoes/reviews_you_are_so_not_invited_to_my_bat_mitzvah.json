It shows how something as small as a soccer player can rock someone\u2019s whole friend group. It was amazing how Sandler\u2019s entire family was it this movie, playing near-identical roles as if this was real life. Teen drama, entertaining to watch.",

    "text": "As a teen this movie was an uncomfortable watch.\n\nAlthough i definitely agree that kids are becoming way too invested in topics they shouldnt such are trying too hard to be attractive (which was shown throughout the movie) it was not discouraged or even criticized, which should have been a point the movie addresses if its gonna be included. Adam Sandler movie humor when the movie features adults feels different to when the movie features kids. Some of the scenes were over the top or not really age appropriate. The message was great however there were some scenes that conflicted with the message or really were unnecessary and provided no entertainment value. Otherwise, Sunny Sandler did great with her lead role and would defmitely give other movies a try.",

    "text": "**Review: You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah (3/5)**  \n\nAdam Sandler is great as always, and I really liked the whole cast. Idina Menzel was awesome, and I think it was such a smart idea for Sandler to include his own daughters in the movie. It makes everything feel more real. Sure, it\u2019s pretty clich\u00e9, but honestly, that\u2019s what teenage life is like\u2014messy, dramatic, and awkward. The movie does a good job showing all of that.  \n\nIt\u2019s a decent coming-of-age story with some really funny moments. It\u2019s nothing super special, but I still had a good time watching it. It\u2019s not the kind of movie that will stick with you forever, but it\u2019s definitely fun and entertaining for what it is. If you\u2019re a fan of Sandler or coming-of-age comedies, it\u2019s worth checking out.",

    "text": "It\u2019s never a good thing when you see a man known as a comedic actor playing the supporting cast in a teen comedy. Particularly when it\u2019s as bland as this one.  Let\u2019s get one thing straight - in essence there is nothing wrong with this comedy. The acting is competent, there are some jokes and there is a plot (though that is tretching the definition a little). \nThe essential problem is that there is absolutely nothing new or surprising about this film.  Teenagers feel angst - shocker. Teenagers have crushes - good grief, really?  Teenagers manage to embarrass themselves and each other - incredible.  Add in an unbelievable rabbi who is perkier than a camp counsellor on a sugar rush, and you\u2019re away.\nPart of the issue is that you have to be able to engage with the teen who views turning 13 as the most life changing event in her tiny little world. I found myself wanting to shake most of the people involved and tell them to get a grip (including the rabbi).",
