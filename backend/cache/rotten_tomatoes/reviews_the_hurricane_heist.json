    "text": "\"The Hurricane Heist\" is not a good movie by any real measure. The acting and dialogue are pretty bad, and the action scenes are bonkers and repetitive. The movie just becomes boring to watch at a point, and I didn't feel invested in the heist element, which is pretty important in a movie like this. I do think there is an element of the movie that is so silly that it is fun for a bad movie night, as I enjoyed the experience of watching it with friends. Overall, that being said, it is a movie that is bad on every technical level, so it is hard to find any other real reason to watch it, especially when there are so many better heist movies out there.",

    "text": "I watched this on DVD recently.  It's much better than the reviews would have you believe.  It's well made with decent acting, special effects, and soundtrack.  The story's pretty good too, but reminded me of other similar films.  The main problem is a hurricane is hardly the ideal weather for filming, so the film is predictably grey and wet.  Perhaps one day we'll get a \"Heatwave Heist\" movie with nice sunny scenes?  Back to this, there's nothing to dislike really, and it deserves a recommendation.",

Dialogue and script were amateurish and lame. Acting was well below average. That said, special effects and visuals were kind of ok. Although the movie was not really boring, the storyline was a messy heap of total nonsense and ridiculousness.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Os americanos gostam bastante de filmes de tornado , furac\u00e3o, mas aqui eles fizeram uma somat\u00f3ria deste estilo de filme e roubo de dinheiro, que seria para descarte. Neste filme temos a a atriz Maggie Grace (da triologia \"Busca Implacavel\" com Liam Neeson) gosto do estilo dela, mas at\u00e9 hoje n\u00e3o teve aquele grande destaque nas telas. Ela faz o papel de uma guarda de seguran\u00e7a do local do governo para o descarte de c\u00e9dulas de dinheiro. Um local onde os ladr\u00f5es onseguem invadir com uma facilidade. H\u00e1 vezes que vemos aqueles filmes que mais da metade \u00e9 so para tramar uma invas\u00e3o e temos todo um esquema milaborante, aqui eles chegam e invadem com uma facilidade incr\u00edvel. E Toby Kebbell que \u00e9 ca\u00e7a tornado e seu irm\u00e3o Ryan que n\u00e3o tem nenhuma forma\u00e7\u00e3o militar e encaram um bando inteiro de ladr\u00f5es preparados que invadiram com uma facilidade o \u00f3rg\u00e3o do governo e apanham para este 2 irm\u00e3os. Sabe quando a estoria \u00e9 for\u00e7ada. E temos de engolir a seco. E o eles v\u00e3o eliminando todos os bandidos de forma incr\u00edvel, at\u00e9 os policiais da cidade. E o gran finale, com um MEGA TORNADO NO RABO DELES, e mais os bandidos, eles vencem tudo e saem com um caminh\u00e3o de dinheiro. Kkkkkkk\nRoteiro e enredo for\u00e7ado de mais, que vo\u00ea tem que engolir a seco.\nVale apena assistir? Se voc\u00ea gosta o estilo bem mentiroso, assista.\nNota: 5",

I wasn't sure if the hurricane was the main plot, or the heist. As it flopped back and forth the more confusing it got. Turn off your brain, grab some popcorn and enjoy the action of this film.",
