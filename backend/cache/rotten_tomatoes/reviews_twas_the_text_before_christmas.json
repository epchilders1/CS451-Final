The acting was done to get paid and I would recommend to anybody 6 feet under xx",

It was as though the writers, the director and the actors just couldn't be bothered. The same utterly lame plot repeated 3 times. Acting more wooden than the worst am dram performance you ever saw. There should be a criminal offence of making a movie as bad as this and anyone associated with this should do time. Save yours and pick another Christmas movie",

Even with that in mind, this movie is garbage. If it doesn't do it justice to say it's \"predictable\": every word that comes out of the characters mouth is the most situationally-appropriate and obvious thing they could possibly say in that moment. As a result, all characters have exactly the same personality. Another reviewer said it's like the script was written by ChatGPT, which is just what I said to my son halfway through. Skip!",

Dated, obvious Xmas score all over it, though not essentially bad it's just so cliche. Absolutely no tension throughout. The most benign, schmaltzy story that took forever to create the inevitable romance that finally rushes to appear in final 5min, with absolutely no fanfare or climax or tension and resolve. It's literally like the entire time the writers just went, that'll do. Print it. Put Christmas in the title. Boom. If you want easy, boring background watching, go for it, otherwise do not waste your time...",

James (Donovan) e Addie (Patterson) e claro que tem uma m\u00e3ozinha da Maybel (Eastwood) m\u00e3e de James. Que Maybel procura uma mulher especial para James. Mas se passam 3 natais entre namoros de um para o outro. At\u00e9 o momento que Addie vai mudar para Australia e James para a Jamanica, ser\u00e1 que n\u00e3o ficaram juntos. Parecendo aquele namoro do gin\u00e1sio? Um filme bem mam\u00e3o com a\u00e7\u00facar e bobinho, mas existem aqueles momentos que pens\u00e1vamos que n\u00e3o existia isso. E existe. Mas \u00e9 claro o Espirito Natalino prevalece.\nRoteiro e enredo tudo simples e bem feito. \nVale apena assistir? Sim recomendo neste momento natalino.\nNota: 6",
