Esta es una pel\u00edcula de la que no esperaba mucho, pero por lo menos esperaba que presente una trama, porque ni siquiera trama tiene. La pel\u00edcula empieza dentro de todo bien pero despu\u00e9s no avanza la trama hasta pasando la mitad de la duraci\u00f3n. Tampoco se me hizo entretenida, que era algo que por lo menos esperaba. El humor tampoco funciona en mi opini\u00f3n, son chistes de que son viejos haciendo cosas que no son comunes en gente de su edad y nada mas; si es verdad que tiene un par de momentos graciosos pero son nulos en la pel\u00edcula y no llega a ser una buena comedia. Por otro lado, como ya dije, lo mejor que tiene es el cast, conformado por Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman y Kevin Kline; todos ellos hacen lo que pueden con el guion que les dieron y se salvan de lo mala que es la cinta. En conclusi\u00f3n, una mala pel\u00edcula que no presenta trama alguna y que adem\u00e1s se queda corta con el humor, solo zafan los actores de renombre que tiene y sin ellos la pel\u00edcula no seria recordada por nadie. No la recomiendo.",

It tells the story of friendship, lost love, new love, and it was done well. Some people can't seem to enjoy a good movie. There was a legendary cast, and great humor. I guess people were expecting the Hangover. I recommend if you're looking for something funny, a good watch.",

So happy I did because I found this film to be well written, well acted fun and at times quite heartwarming. The four guys were fine, but it was Mary Steenburgen, who stole the film with her portrayal of a lounge singer. If you haven't seen it, you should .Viva last Vegas.",
