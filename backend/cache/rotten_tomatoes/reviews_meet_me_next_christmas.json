    "text": "Not the best of films, it mostly felt rushed and off putting. I would have probably enjoyed it more if they had made it a mystery with how the Pentatonix were pulling stings for Layla and Teddy (without being seen and only then at the end show a rough idea of what they did to make the lovebirds get together) because the way the film was moving back and forth did not make any sense at all and felt really jumbled. I know that my review is quite negative but I would also love to give credit where credit is due, and with that being said there ARE two characters that stood out for me, first the drunk Santa, not much dialogue but his presence was humorous. Secondly the cousin...golly what a jolly character and played well (by Kalen Allen), got me laughing really hard. I could tell for a fact that blood, sweet and tears were put into perfecting the character; lovely charisma.",

The story was so heartwarming, with just the right mix of romance, humor, and holiday spirit. It\u2019s the kind of movie that makes you believe in the magic of love and Christmas all over again.\n\nThe characters were lovable, the chemistry was spot-on, and the pacing was perfect. Every scene felt meaningful, and the way the story unfolded was both touching and satisfying. It\u2019s one of those movies that leaves you with a warm, happy feeling by the end.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a festive movie that\u2019s full of charm and heartfelt moments, Meet Me Next Christmas is a must-watch. I absolutely loved it and will definitely be adding it to my holiday movie tradition!",

    "text": "Interesting that no one mentions the Ru Paul cameos.  Netflix can\u2019t make a movie without plugging one of their other cringey shows.  I\u2019ve been subjected to a lot of Hallmark Channel this year and this movie is poorly written and overproduced in comparison to their churn of cheaply made nonsense.  The Pentatonix scenes give it a \u201cfan fiction\u201d feel, the only likable character is Teddy, and not one ounce of this is grounded in reality.  The weird tantric sex couple alone is enough to turn this off.",

I found myself asking questions like, why am I still watching this, HOW did some of the people in this cast agree to do this movie, there\u2019s no way there\u2019s still X amount of time left, is Penatatonix embarrassed by it, and which of my friends have also suffered through that I can text about it.\n\nI never abandoned ship and did watch it all the way through, but I can\u2019t recommend someone else to do the same.",

She is rude and condicending the whole time while every other character have no other role except to serve her. Other than her there is no depth of other characters or parallel plot lines it was just all around her who is not enjoyable to watch.",

Not like the hallmark movies with bad wigs and the SAME story line where the buisness is going under and the person who moved away comes back and has to save it and ends up falling in love with the person they use to be at odds with. Great job directors,actors and all involved.we need moreee",

    "text": "Cute, but clich\u00e9d like all the many modern Christmas romcoms. Meet Me Next Christmas follows Layla (Christina Milian) on a bizarre quest through New York City to secure tickets for a sold-out Pentatonix Christmas Eve concert, aiming to reconnect with a man she met at the airport one year prior. The film leans into a predictable narrative that aligns with what you'd expect for an ending. Milian's performance brings charm to the lead role, and her chemistry with co-star Devale Ellis adds a cute spark to the storyline. While the plot is a complete stretch beyond believability, the movie offers some lighthearted humor.",

    "text": "Christmas movie? Absolutely! That means lots of predictability (no 5 stars), AND feel good, silliness, and music. Features several Pentatonix Christmas favorites and a couple new ones for the movie, all of which meet their very high standards. some plot points and cinematography reminded me of the second Sabrina movie, a personal favorite = Another plus.\n\nThis is definitely not a Hallmark movie \u2013 \u2013 see, for example, drag queen performance and humor \u2013 \u2013 while doing that genre much better, in my book.\n\nWe watched \"Meet me...\" the night after loving Pentatonix do their 2024 live-tour Christmas show, and enjoyed it more because of that. The sellout crowd ranged from children through octogenarians, lots of dancing, and everyone having a blast. The show in the movie definitely got me in the Christmas spirit...\n\nFor any curmudgeon posting a slam review, maybe you free up some concert demand for the rest of us. Better yet, meet us for their show next Christmas, and maybe you'll make new friends (or at least we'll get an extra ticket).\n\nP.S: Maybe I finally figured out how Hallelujah could be a Christmas song.",
