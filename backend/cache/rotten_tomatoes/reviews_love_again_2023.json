That is what I enjoyed about this movie though. It really draws you into the pain Mira feels and what true love feel like, while providing the predictable sense of hope that you can go on and love\u2026again.",

So many other younger beautiful actresses could have been used for this role but no... it was all about what \u00a3 the celebrity will bring to the market... This will NOT be a classic, a terrible watch.",

Sam H. who I adore played the character very shallow...never settled inot the role. \nAnd Priyanka....I've never seen her previously in anything, she was ok.\nBUT TOGETHER...they had like MINUS 0 chemistry. \nThat was the huge problem no chemistry at ALL.\n\nThe writing was poor, and I agree the Celine D. character-well she's not an actress so her delivery was PAINFUL... and why oh why would the man lie and not tell her...hey I mentioned you to Celine and she \"loves your work....\" like get the gratitude INSTEAD IT'S ANOTHER LIE HE'S TELLING. \nJUST AWFUL.",

    "text": "The idea is interesting and, although it vaguely resembles \"P.S.: I Love You\", it has its touches of originality. I loved the presence of Queen Celine Dion, but the jokes about the songs and the \"therapy\" sessions with her seemed quite forced. They weren't necessary. I think it had the right touch of drama to keep the film light and I sympathized with the protagonists. I had fun and didn't have any grudges against anyone, so it's worth it!",

    "text": "Finally got around to watching *Love Again* after a year on my watchlist. Honestly, the only reason I was interested was Celine Dion, and she did not disappoint! Her songs fit perfectly, and she acts surprisingly well\u2014she\u2019s more than just a cameo, which was such a fun surprise. The plot? Cheesy and clich\u00e9, but isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re here for in a romcom like this? It\u2019s cozy, lighthearted, and gave me a few chuckles. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s definitely not groundbreaking. The pacing drags a bit in places, and with sharper writing and editing, it could\u2019ve been so much better. Still, I was never bored, and it\u2019s a decent pick when you\u2019re in the mood for something romantic but not too demanding. Definitely a \u201cbackground movie\u201d vibe, but hey, sometimes that\u2019s all you need. A solid 3-star watch for a cozy night in!",

But the screenplay is very engaging which makes the film watchable and the performances are also good. Not expected much but it will not disappoint you either. A one time watch for romcom fans.",

    "text": "Well, this movie is tailor made for emotional teary audience who literally believe in the power beyond when it comes to love. Priyanka Chopra as usual tries very hard to deliver but to no avail. Her character just comes off as silly and bland and the audience rarely connects with the character over the course of the movie. The comedy is just cringey. The one good aspect of the movie is Celine Dion, even with her limited screen presence she gives some meaning to the movie especially her songs.",

In their own world without a thought as to what audiences appreciate. \n I wasn't sure if the  plot  could make the payoff believable but they did it just right. All the actors were great.

Silly screen play, jumped all over the place and really had no point. Yes they tried to do a Hallmark movie, but it was not even a good rom-com. Sorry friends, my opinion.",

    "text": "\"Love Again\" is a theatrical release that feels more like a streaming service movie, with its lackluster storytelling and underdeveloped characters. Priyanka delivers a solid performance, but the film falls short in creating meaningful connections between the characters, especially the main character and her deceased boyfriend.\n\nThe concept of the phones being in someone else's name and the subsequent texting adds a touch of intrigue, but the execution lacks depth. The predictable and drawn-out love story fails to deliver the excitement that could have elevated the plot.\n\nCeline Dion's appearance as herself in the film adds a layer of authenticity, with many of her lines reflecting her real-life experiences with Renee. However, her portrayal comes across as cold and self-absorbed, casting her in an unfavorable light. This portrayal may alienate viewers who are not die-hard fans of Celine Dion, painting her as the villain rather than a relatable protagonist.\n\nOverall, \"Love Again\" falls short of expectations and fails to leave a lasting impression. With its unengaging plot and unlikable characters, it is not a film worth revisiting or recommending. This lackluster production earns a disappointing half-star rating.",
