    "text": "This movie started out pretty good and I was looking forward to a fun night. And then it got ridiculously stupid. Is all these monsters coming to life and chasing people and it just went on and on and on. I really don\u2019t believe this is very good for little kids because it is pretty violent. I finally turned it off after 15 minutes of chasing monsters. It got really boring. There was no story. And they tried to put a little comedy in, which was stupid too. Not recommended.",

    "text": "*The Curse of Bridge Hollow* is a decent, if generic, Halloween family film that delivers just enough fun for a lighthearted watch. Having enjoyed Marlon Wayans in *White Chicks* and *Scary Movie*, I was curious to see him in this. While the film doesn\u2019t capture the same charm as those earlier works, it\u2019s still entertaining enough for a spooky movie marathon. The special effects are solid, and the acting is passable, but nothing particularly standout. Some of the jokes hit the mark, but others fall flat, adding to the overall mediocrity of the film. It's all very predictable, but I didn\u2019t mind much\u2014I had fun watching it. If it had been geared more toward an adult audience, it probably would have been better, but for a family-friendly Halloween film, it's enjoyable enough. Perfect for a casual watch, but not one that will stick with you.",

Even though, it was still fun! Perfect Halloween themed movie for the family! The adventure, the healthy family dynamic, the safe town environment, and dad bonding is something I can really appreciate.",

    "text": "This is not very good. The story is really basic and unimaginative. The humour relies solely on Marlon Wayans and he is the most entertaining aspect of this film. The music is mostly good, if unimaginative. The sound design and cinematography are very forgettable. I didn't even like the editing, most of the time they just showed the person that was speaking and not the other people's reactions. The acting is average at best and the characters they are playing are exceptionally generic. The big problem is that most of the time they say their lines then wait, it's all about them delivering lines and no reactions. I blame the director on that one. The effects are actually pretty weak and unconvincing for 2022. Look at them driving the car in the establishing sequence. It looks bad! The writing and directing are pretty weak, certainly below average. It is just about engaging enough to hold my attention to the end. I will not be watching it again, please do not waste your time with a sequel unless you're going to do something wildly different with it.",

    "text": "The Curse of Bridge Hollow (2022) is a pretty cute family movie for spooky vibes around Halloween. The Fall look of this town decorated for Halloween looks great. The performances are silly enough to be entertaining. It wants to be Hocus Pocus, Goosebumps, Nightbooks, or Halloweentown, although The Curse of Bridge Hollow just is not on that level. Marlon Wayans just goes for it and cuts down skeleton football players with a chainsaw for a fun sequence. Priah Ferguson plays a great foil for Wayans, but Kelly Rowland should have gotten something to do besides bake poorly.",
