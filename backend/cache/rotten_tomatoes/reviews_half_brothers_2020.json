This movie was an absolute delight from beginning to end it's not just a broke comedy or road movie but in an insightful movie about family relations as Missy as they can be it's a great movie I highly recommend",

    "text": "Sadly, it seems like someone had a good concept for a story but no real way to make it stick. Spoilers ahead... If the whole movie wasn't already spoiled, as in, rotten. Anyway, the son is left by his father tells him on his deathbed he has a really good reason for not coming back. But it wasn't a really good reason. Make the two sons solve a riddle to only see a video of the dead father giving an explanation... Couldn't he have just told them before he died versus make them traverse the US? Oh, and sure, the Mexican mom didn't want the father to come back because he cheated. But I'm sorry, the first son is 35 now andthe father obviously has the funds to travel, he did so to create a riddle just before he died. So what was the excuse for not returning to Mexico once the first son had aged out and the 17 years thereafter. Sorry, plot holes throughout pandering for heartfelt touches. None from me.",

    "text": "I needed a comedy and stumbled across this film on Amazon Freevee. Well, it's *billed* as a comedy, but it's really so much more than that. It's got serious emotional beats that offer surprising depth. It speaks volumes that critics didn't have much love for the film, but the audience score is pretty good. I ended up buying it on iTunes just so I could access the director's commentary. Luke Greenfield put a lot of thought into everything you see, and it starts with the cast, which is excellent. Worth a watch if you don't mind getting hit in the feels during a \"comedy film.\"",

    "text": "Driven by clich\u00e9 to generate laughs through comedy and touch hearts as family drama unfolds while taking it further by providing social commentary with reality-based perspectives. Any of that should guarantee a successful formula stirring pure enjoyment, but it turns out it was ridiculously plotted whilst overrun by stereotypical cynicism that leant more unbalanced, despite actually aligning in agreement as reflection of yet being proven otherwise. That's mainly social underlining truth with zero hefty justification for the narrative structure, but addressing immigration seems to be the only relevant insight to absorb as more effective over the rest of the characterized plot's seeming excuse just to get on with an important subject in an aimless matter. The only successes amid the storyline are understanding and bit funny. (B-)",

The movie was heartwarming and I love the theme of forgiveness & understanding. I think it's always a reminder for me when I see it onscreen to be more open. Loved the backstory of a Mexican immigrants journey, made it a personal. I haven't seen this addressed in a lighthearted but still real way. If you are not anal, you should watch this. You will enjoy it",
