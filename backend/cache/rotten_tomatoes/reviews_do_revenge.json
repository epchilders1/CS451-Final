    "text": "The 2004 'Mean Girls' holds a very special place in my heart and I enjoyed the nods that 'Do Revenge' made to it (along with a few other classic teen movies!). Some details of the plot were rushed and lacking in terms of credibility, which was a shame. A more condensed timeline may have helped give a better sense of the intensity of the friendships... as it stands I just didn't really believe any of them. That said, it was fun and unexpected with a cracking sound track - I think Regina George would approve!",

    "text": "High budget movie with pretty naive aspects to it. Production was good, loved the outfits! Writing was lacking some... details I guess. Sometimes it felt like screenwriters could've done a better job. But what really saved the movie is the plot twist which took place after a hour of watching. It was so unexpected, like BANG! And the tables immediately turned. No disrespect to Austin (who played Max) but I think that it would be better if creators picked another actor for this role, just my opinion...",

    "text": "\u201cThis movie is fueled by climate denialism, making it fundamentally rotten. Its content is nothing more than personal revenge wrapped in a fake sense of coolness, while mocking issues that are crucial to the world. In Do Revenge, instead of showing teenagers as thoughtful or socially aware, the film paints them as so consumed by petty revenge games that they even turn climate change activism into a joke. When the youth of today are meant to be the front line in addressing the climate crisis, reducing activism to a punchline is not just irresponsible\u2014it\u2019s harmful. Worse, these shallow and vengeful characters risk becoming false role models for kids, normalizing cruelty and trivializing global issues. Movies like this shouldn\u2019t just be criticized\u2014they should be banned for the damage they do to young minds and the seriousness of the issues they mock.\u201d",

They were all extremely flawed and problematic.\u00a0\u2028It\u2019s definitely not funny like Mean Girls and the writing is not as sharp, but it was a frothy fun flick.",

But that's the thing: all of these million movies only \"look\" like The Justice League, but they don't \"be\" The Justice League. It's an innovative movie, with beautiful performances that are great to watch, as well as perfect costumes and elegant visuals that are enough to overshadow any plot holes or mistakes that it ends up making at times. A good, very good movie, perfect to watch with a group of friends.",

    "text": "It's personally offensive to me that this movie is rated so highly because I found about 2 minutes of it likable and the rest--meaning TWO more hours--was absolute garbage. There's no reason a teen comedy should drag on for over 2 hours even if it's good. And those 2 minutes were all Sophie Turner.\n\nThe movie is filled with unlikable one-dimensional characters who have really learned nothing by the end of the movie. Seriously, I did not like or care about a single one of the characters. It borrows heavily from classic 90s and 2000s teen movies such as Mean Girls, John Tucker Must Die, Cruel Intentions, and Clueless, but only marginally adds its own spin. And I would rather watch ANY of those movies over Do Revenge.",

    "text": "Plot has a lot of promise but I felt alienated by the indulgent, fantasy-like portrayal of the high school senior experience. Barbie-esque scenes throughout. Very divorced from reality. Fear it could negatively impact impressionable high school students who are already having to navigate their challenging coming-of-age landscape.  Impressed by Camila Mendes' performance. Maya Hawke's acting was a turn-off though. The two British actors appeared misplaced in the film (felt Sophie Turner overplayed every \"angry-english\" scene she was in).",
