    "text": "The movie is entirely predictable and unbelievable but most action thrillers are nowadays anyways. It is easy to watch - without making a whole show of it. \n\nSomething really wholesome about characters being unique individuals outside of their gender/skin color and to see that in a Netflix movie with a strong cast is impressive. \n\nA part 2 should surely do the premise more justice! \n\nP.S. I have seen action stunts that look far far more improbable in the mission impossible series- at least everyone engaging in action sequences here looked fit enough to carry them out!",

Oh hell yes!\nYes, I can understand how others may rate this with a low score if they are simply looking at it as a polished work of art, which it isn't. But if you can get past its flaws and grrl power memes you will find yourself amused at its premise.\nI was impressed with the chase scenes.",

    "text": "A truly awful film and a waste of a talented cast. The plot must have been written by AI. It had every cliched plot point you could imagine; the ordinary man becoming a hero; spy stuff; the beautiful ex-girlfriend; action; a foreign location. It wasn't even funny, just grim.i gritted my teal and slogged through it. I'd like to say that there were some interesting plot points that could have been done better it expanded upon, but that wasn't the case. I appreciate that companies such as Netflix need content to keep their subscribers happy, but the quality needs to be much better, even if it takes longer to produce.",

Halle Berry absolutely made me cringe, roll my eyes, gave me a headache and I had to verify that she was only awarded one Razzie. From this performance, she deserves dozens! She is physically awkward, can't deliver a believable line and has zero charisma. Even though everyone else was only passable, she completely ruined the movie! I've seen much better acting in junior high school plays.",

I got what I wanted and expected: just a two hour joy ride. Very positive: Despite the many killings, there is no real graphic violence, just little blood, and very little foul language.",
