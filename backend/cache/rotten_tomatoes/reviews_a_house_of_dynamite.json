From start to finish, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, pushing you to question whether this could be a glimpse of our own reality on day. In the end, it leaves you with a powerful reminder: no matter what position of authority we hold, we are all just human\u2014with the same beating heart \u2014praying the life decisions we make are the right ones.",
