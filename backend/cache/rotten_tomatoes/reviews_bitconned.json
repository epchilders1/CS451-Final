It is a well made, well shot story of brazen scammers and highlights the gullibility of the general public who want to 'get rich quick'. Almost to brazen to believe. But it's true. Reminded me of the excellent BBC4 series \"Storyville\". That's high praise.",

    "text": "This crime documentary was really good. The entire crew did an excellent job on bringing this crime story to life. The man responsible, Ray Trapani, is just a greedy, selfish person with no respect for anything and will step on anyone to get what he wants. He got off with no jail time, which is wrong. He probably bought off the court because he knows that he wouldn't last long in jail. He's a coward and he knows it. If you haven't seen this documentary yet, check it out sometime. It'll show you how corrupt Trapani is and that people like him should never be trusted.",

It's not as much that, but more of a by the steps, first person bio-version of a wan tent kid then adult classical scammer. Ray Trapani was a more extreme version of me and a lot of people I knew and grew up with. We wanted financial freedom at a young age by either legitimate, which was our first choice, or by weighed-risk, semi-legal methods. If it weren't for Ray's drug habit, he'd of probably succeeded with making his vision legitimate. He was definitely high when deciding to make up extreme company bios and a fictional CEO. Still, he had a blast with the wealth he created. He enjoyed the hi-life at a young age. Pretty good watch as a documentary, and a heck of an achievement for someone of his limited education and experience. Just saying...",

It did not paint Ray Trapani as a saint but he is such a narcissistic sociopath that I was enraged by his criminal \"wink and nod\" about what he did - no contrition - and as someone with a childhood ambition of being a criminal, his mother comments  are disgraceful.",

It shows the broiler room mentality from crypto con-artists in such an alluring manner that it seems like a puff-piece, not a scathing documentary. The sad thing is the film made the main characters look so cool that people will look at the them, one in particular, with admiration rather than contempt.",

I am in favor of increasing the prison sentences for such people and pawning their \"property\" until the fraud amount has been repaid. I hate all this guys, hope that they will earn no more money with that and want to stop this whole currency thing.",
