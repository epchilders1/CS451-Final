The cinematography alone gives subtile surreal qualities to every place it captures, exactly sizing up the available room and adding additonal dimension to it, before twist after twist works its way through. The story and sequencing are weird in the right way, building up carefully to finally make sense.\nThe acting is committed, horror fans having some of their favorites playing against their images. \nIt's clear, why people were so hyped up about Weapons as a follow-up movie.",

The ending was so bad I thought it was going to be a dream sequence. Lots of great potential which unfortunately didn\u2019t maintain a good course throughout the film. I still recommend only if you can stream for free.",

    "text": "There was so much buzz about this movie and after watching Weapons everyone told me I had to see Barbarian and it was brilliant. Well, everyone lied. It feels like no one actually bothered to write the movie in it's entirety. The plot holes are gapping and the entire premise of how they got in the house is also completely ridiculous. This is the first horror movie that, 90 seconds in, I was hoping every character died just so I could be rid of them. I only kept watching because e everyone said there was a crazy twist. Where? Where was the mind blowing plot twist? Worst horror movie I've ever seen. And, in fact, first horror movie I have ever been upset I watched.",

    "text": "Title: Utterly Frustrating\n\nSo, I finally decided to check out *Barbarian* after hearing some buzz around it, but wow, what a letdown! Directed by Zach Cregger, who I guess was trying for some edgy horror, the film really falls flat. The plot had potential, but the characters? Absolutely brain-dead. Seriously, who in their right mind would decide to explore a creepy basement alone in a house they've just discovered is already inhabited by a stranger?\n\nJustin Long and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd may have some acting chops, but they couldn\u2019t save these ridiculous character choices. It\u2019s like they were all struck with a severe case of poor judgment. No one behaves this stupidly in real life\u2014at least not that I know of!\n\nTo be fair, Cregger\u2019s next flick, *Weapons*, is way better.  Maybe he just needed to warm up? But honestly, if *Barbarian* is anything to go by, he\u2019s got a long way to go. Save your time and skip this one unless you enjoy yelling at characters making dumb decisions\u2014it\u2019s exhausting!",

    "text": "I've still got to be convinced by the Rotty critics analysis of many films. Often they seem to almost border on the scam spectrum. \n\nBarbarian .. which I suffered til the very end was quite simply one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure to view. Yes there's a bit of decent acting, editing and camerawork.. But call me old fashioned I like a script that suspends my disbelief. Cool film making this is not . Hmm let's think of a comparison.. Psycho, The Shining, It, To name just three wonderful pieces of cinema. Maybe the idiot director and production company should watch these before wasting their efforts again. \n\nHype. No style. \n\nNot to sound too intellectual but this film is total bollocks. \n\nHow he was funded to make his new pile of cack \"weapons\" is beyond me. Possibly the worst film ending of all time. I often wonder if the director was actually in the cutting room for the final 5 minutes. Or was he sleeping with the editors girlfriend at the time..",

Think it would have been better to carry on teasing and leave the monster to our imagination for a while rather than full on exposure of it so early on in the film as it then made the remainder when AJ was down there less scary as we knew what was coming and what to expect.",
