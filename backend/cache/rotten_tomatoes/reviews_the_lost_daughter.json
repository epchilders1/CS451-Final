    "text": "What an utterly pretentious waste of time becomed painful to watch. Well acted sure but pointless and senseless. There is no plot to speak of and the characters were not developed enough for the relationships to make any sense. Avoid this unless really good acting by Olivia Coleman is all you need. Perhaps it's a powerful novel that just should not have been made into a movie.",

Olivia Colman & Jessie Buckley are superb playing the older/younger version of Leda. Gyllenhaal did a wonderful job directing this gem. I look forward to seeing more from her. Some criticisms state that \"nothing happens\" but I feel that there's SO much happening in every scene. I really loved it.",

If top acting,  intense dialog scenes and uncomfortable closeups are your thing then look no further. Yes this is a movie that a lot of people will hate because the synopsis tricked them into thinking this is about \"seeing dead people\"....it is not. It is an outpour of motherly love, hate, selfreflection and self loathing all drizzled with a lot of booze. I loved it I found it hypnotizing to look at. It made me feel good about myself for not being any of those people. Amazing debut for Maggy and almost getting anxious to see her next project.  For the people who gave half a star. It is a confession of how little you know about life.",

Ed Harris\u2019s character has no real impact, his presence changes nothing. The pacing is painfully slow, and the ending offers no resolution, leaving you feeling like you\u2019ve wasted time on a film full of awkward moments and missed potential. So to save you some time, don\u2019t waste your time on this movie. It\u2019s pretty much clickbait.",

We're told the people \"aren't good people,\" which goes nowhere. I guess it's generational torture of having kids that is the point. I'd write some more; but I just don't care. Pass.",
