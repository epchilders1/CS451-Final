I accept that it's not an original story and the movie it's very stupid, but it is really entertaining and the actors did grate job with their interpretations, this movie deserves better. I think it's a great movie to whach with your family, it's also the goal of this movie, to remind us that all members of our family are important and that we all sometimes need to learn more from eachother, something that now a days a lot of families don't take it into account. Love this movie!",

Everything else is random acts of blatant stupidity followed by the cringest possible payoffs. A modern take an a classic story. By modern I mean, juvenile level writing with decent attempts at acting a horrific story.",

    "text": "**Family Switch** is the kind of movie that doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but wow, it knows how to keep you smiling. I absolutely *love* this cast\u2014they bring so much charm and energy to a story we\u2019ve seen a hundred times. Body-swap comedies aren\u2019t new, but this one hits all the right notes of brainless fun and heartfelt moments about the importance of family. \n\nI went in with zero expectations and ended up pleasantly surprised. The humor is actually *good*, with some solid jokes that had me laughing out loud, and the pacing is spot on\u2014you\u2019re never bored. Sure, it\u2019s predictable, but that\u2019s part of the comfort here. It\u2019s just really fun and incredibly heartwarming in the way it reminds you what really matters in life.  \n\nTurn off your brain, grab some popcorn, and enjoy. Sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what you need.",
