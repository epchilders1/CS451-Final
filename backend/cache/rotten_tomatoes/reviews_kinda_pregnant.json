    "text": "Mikey\u2019s Movie Review: Kinda Pregnant (2025)\n\nNetflix have been accused of late for releasing a lot of average films to meet the quota and demand for new \u2018content\u2019. For every The Irishman or Extraction there\u2019s been an Unfrosted or Back In Action\u2026 Kinda Pregnant falls somewhere among the later category.\n\nWithout doubt Amy Schumer remains Marmite for both critics and audiences. Despite her recent and sadly short lived Disney+ series Life And Beth (a dramedy that dealt with some heavy topics such as autism, abuse and depression in a quirky, dryly funny indie film way), she has yet to find the right vehicle to change that opinion. Kinda Pregnant would seem like the perfect film for her brand of humour and real-life experiences but has so far recieved mostly negative reviews.\n\nThe film is actually OK, although very hit and miss in both its comedy and dealing with more serious issues. Though there are some zingers throughout it vears from juvenile to crass to clever (sometimes in the same scene), so it never really lands on a consistent tone. While it is being marketed as a modern \u2018chick flick\u2019 it most definitely and defiantly has one foot in the 90\u2019s. Anyone familiar with Mrs. Doubfire and The Wedding Singer knows exactly the kinda film they\u2019re trying to make. It just falls short\u2026 as if no-one quite knew where to grow the idea after the initial conception\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s assisted of course by a solid cast that includes the likes of an excellent Will Forte and Brianne Howey and some of the set pieces are mildly amusing. Plus it features another solid score from Happy Madison Productions regular Rupert Gregson-Williams. \n\nPerhaps with a few more passes at the script and a better director (seriously, who keeps hiring Tyler Spindel?) Schumer might have delivered more of a success. Still, if you\u2019re stuck for something to watch, ignore the online hate and just take it for what it is, a silly, switch-your-brain-off romp with a handful of chucklesome moments.\n\nMikey\u2019s Movie Rating: 3/5*",

It's incredibly hard to find a single redeeming quality about the main character. None of the humor hits. In fact, the further the story moves along, the more the main character becomes dislikable. Please save your time and do not bother watching.",

You think it\u2019s simple at first, maybe even slow, but then it plants something an idea, a feeling and it just sits there, gently growing. Definitely worth a watch if you\u2019re in the mood for something soft, a little raw, and quietly moving. Kinda pregnant with meaning, if you let it be.",

    "text": "\u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is a Rom-Com that doesn\u2019t deliver on the romance or the comedy. While the premise is barely interesting, not only does the plot, during its ninety minute runtime, in no way justify or fulfil the thesis in any way, but doesn\u2019t even understand it\u2019s own weak premise as the story has no direction, paper thin character motivations and a consistent confusion about what the message of this film should be by the time we reach the indescribably bland ending which was disconnected from the premise and plot \u201cbuilding up\u201d to it. Even as a movie released only 40 days into the year, it\u2019s already a clear contender for worst movie of 2025.",
