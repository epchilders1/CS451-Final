The character of Parshand was likable. There is just nothing memorable about it. I just finished this movie, and I can already feel the memory of this film fading away.",

Only fairly obvious mistake is, I don\u2019t know what they were thinking with the motorcycle guy and trying to turn him into some sort of Pakistani Ethan Hunt. It was weird and it didn\u2019t work. I actually feel like you could remove him entirely from the movie and it would be better for it. it was giving Bollywood vibes not what you want in an action film of that type.",

I got the feeling there was much effort given by Gerard Butler pretty sure he phoned it in, I don\u2019t blame him.",

I would put this beside Hurt Locker. Simple, plain, emotion, real action. No drama, unusual dialogs, etc. It also showed how agents create numerous frenemies to stay alive.\n\nWowww Gerard Butler has banged it.",

I like that they take this totally seriously for a simple action thriller on Netflix. Navid's character telling Gerard's CIA agent the human cost of America's operations was a powerful scene. The night vision goggles shootout against the helicopter was pretty awesome, I'm not going to lie.",
