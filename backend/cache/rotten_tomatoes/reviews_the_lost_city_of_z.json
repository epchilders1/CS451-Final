I thoroughly enjoyed it ,as it harks back to a time when movies were sumptuous, and the dialogue and acting were as important as the action. Probably showing my age , but i can understand the younger generation would find this not to their taste. It\u2019s certainly no Indiana Jones model.. but more restrained and thoughtful and beautifully shot. The fact it is a true story makes it even more poignant. A feast for mature movie buffs.",

    "text": "The movie adaptation of the David Grann book, The Lost City of Z, bites off more than it can chew. While Percy Fawcett was a trailblazing explorer and honorable soldier he ultimately abandoned his wife and children,  and in so sacrificing his oldest son to the jungle in satisfaction of his ego and blind obsessions. It\u2019s a story of a man with a lifelong chip on his shoulder who places self aggrandizement over family. \n\nThe movie dispels with all but the most obvious Amazonian \u201cgreen hell\u201djungle hazards thereby losing texture of the central theme of the movie.",

    "text": "Having loved David Grann's \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" both the book and the film, I dove into other books by the author and stumbled upon \"Lost City of Z.\" I have to say, this book was incredibly hard to put down. It was like a binge-worthy TV show\u2014every page had me hooked. As I read, my spirit of adventure was reignited, and I found myself reminiscing about past travels in South America and the Amazon, trying to connect with Colonel Percy Fawcett. The book had me daydreaming all day and night, completely engrossed in its adventure.\n\n was really torn about whether to watch the movie adaptation of \"Lost City of Z.\" I wanted to see how the film portrayed the depth of the forest, the tribal costumes, and the illnesses, comparing it to the vivid images I\u2019d built up in my mind. On the flip side, I loved the character and challenges I had imagined myself, without any screen influence.\n\nOne lone night, when my movie partner (my wife) wasn\u2019t around, I decided to give it a go. The deciding factor was the cast\u2014Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson, two actors I really enjoy watching. Those two ended up being the only reason that i can say i could sit through the movie in the end. \n\nOverall, the film felt pretty shallow\u2014lacking real emotional depth, character development, and a strong plot direction. It seemed loosely inspired by historical events but missed the chance to delve deeper into the characters' lives and the complexities of the time period. Compared to the book, the film deviates significantly. The book intertwines two parallel journeys: one of Colonel Fawcett in the past and the other of author James Gray retracing Fawcett's route in modern times. These parallel stories, despite being separated by time, share similarities and challenges. This whole dynamic was missing from the film, leaving out a key element that could have added much more depth.\n\nThe film's pacing was all over the place, with lazy dialogue and crucial details left out. For instance, one moment a companion is being eaten by piranhas, and the next, there\u2019s no mention of him at all. The movie barely touches on the horrific illnesses or the unique traits of the tribes encountered. Overall, it felt like a hot mess, failing to do justice to a beautiful and riveting story. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more let down by a film adaptation of a book. The film didn\u2019t just fall short; it felt like it missed the essence of the book entirely. What made the book so compelling was its depth, the rich detail, and the way it captured the spirit of adventure and exploration.  It\u2019s frustrating when a film adaptation fails to live up to the highs of its literary counterpart, and this one was particularly disheartening because the potential was there, but it just didn\u2019t deliver. 4/10",

Can the lack of clear answers be frustrating? Perhaps. But isn't that the cost of discovery and progress? So much time and energy spent towards things you may never know the answer to. So many journeys taken only to still have that void in your soul.",
