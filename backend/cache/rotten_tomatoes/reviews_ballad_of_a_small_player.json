The cinematography is brilliant.  This is a triumph of digital film making when there is so much visual guff about.  The staging is brilliant and was no doubt very challenging for the bigger scenes but every shot looks really thought out and there is effort to give the viewer something extra.  Very artistic.  There is some really good dialogue but it\u2019s also very sparse.   A lot of people say they thought they guessed the twist, I\u2019m not sure about that, there were at least three plausible ways it could have gone given the clues.  This film requires a bit of work from the viewer.  I needed to watch it in 2 parts to really enjoy it.",

    "text": "Simply amazing. The colors, cinematography, and of course, the plot were all top tier. This film is a creative masterpiece, both visually and story telling wise, and the performance from Farell was astonishing. I dove into this movie expecting a straight forward tale of an addiction gambler, but what I got was something far more valuable - the story of a man gripped by greed, delusion and grandiosity - and his path at redemption. The plot twist was solid, and if you take into account the hints that are subtly given throughout the film you realize that the truth of his journey is not explicitly stated, a real movie that makes you think! The only thing I noticed was the pace of the film was very sparatic, at some points resembling an action-packed movie while at others feeling like more of a slow, introspective film. I can understand why some people may not love it, but if you do, it is incredible.",

    "text": "This is a well crafted, well casted message movie. It's about greed, excess, fantasizing about being \"better than\" (a Lord), all causing the ruination of 2 poor lost souls.  Colin Farell's acting knocks it out of the park. His gambling addiction. His alcohol addiction. His thievery. His fantasy of being a Lord. His medical problem. And when he has it all, he discovers all the excesses are what's making him this lonely lost soul. So he throws it all away in exchange for redemption and maybe happiness.",

    "text": "Ballad Of A Small Player is an ambitious and inventive film, but one I feel fails to convince. Due I believe to a weak and patchy script. It's directed by Edward Berger, but I don't think it lives up to his two previous films. The film is set in Macau and is concerned with 'Lord Doyle', a degenerate gambler and swindler who is wanted for fraud and set on a path of destruction. We see Doyle once gain having a losing night at the baccarat tables. He is approached by Dao Ming, a credit broker, who seeks his patronage. Doyle and Ming are lost souls with lots of baggage and they form a rather odd bond. Doyle is also pursued by Cynthia Blithe, who is employed by Doyle's UK creditors. There is not much more plot after this. The film is more about style than substance. But it does look great. The colours and lights of Macau are shown off with great effect. But the storyline is rather muddled and unconvincing. Colin Farrell is great though as the troubled gambler and Tild Swinton is great as Blithe. A worthwhile watch in parts, but a slightly disappoiniting film in total.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Hay pel\u00edculas que giran en torno a la perdici\u00f3n y otras que la observan con una mezcla de fascinaci\u00f3n y tristeza. Maldita suerte pertenece a las dos. Edward Berger nos lleva a una Macao hipn\u00f3tica, de luces de ne\u00f3n y ruletas girando sin descanso, donde Colin Farrell interpreta a un jugador que intenta escapar de s\u00ed mismo. Est\u00e1 magn\u00edfico: agotado, ir\u00f3nico y con esa melancol\u00eda que solo los que han perdido demasiado saben mostrar.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula tiene el ritmo de una resaca elegante. No busca la \u00e9pica, sino el temblor interior del que lo ha apostado todo y a\u00fan as\u00ed sigue tirando los dados. Berger filma con un pulso seguro, aunque a veces se deje llevar m\u00e1s por la forma que por el fondo. Pero incluso en sus excesos, hay algo hipn\u00f3tico, casi po\u00e9tico, en la forma en que retrata la adicci\u00f3n como una especie de limbo entre la vida y la desaparici\u00f3n.\n\nTilda Swinton, en el papel de una detective con m\u00e1s intuici\u00f3n que paciencia, aporta un contrapunto perfecto: sobria, contenida, incisiva. Su presencia ancla la historia, la humaniza, y evita que el delirio visual se vuelva vac\u00edo. Fala Chen, por su parte, a\u00f1ade un toque enigm\u00e1tico y et\u00e9reo que le da un aire casi on\u00edrico al relato.\n\nNo todo funciona \u2014algunos tramos se sienten irregulares o demasiado calculados\u2014, pero el resultado es una pel\u00edcula que se queda contigo m\u00e1s por su atm\u00f3sfera que por su argumento. Es un viaje entre el lujo decadente y la ruina emocional, donde cada mirada dice m\u00e1s que las palabras.\n\nMaldita suerte es una historia sobre perder, pero tambi\u00e9n sobre seguir jugando. Porque a veces, lo m\u00e1s humano no es ganar\u2026 sino volver a apostar.\n\n(ENGLISH) Some films revolve around ruin, while others watch it unfold with a mix of fascination and sorrow. Ballad of a Small Player \u2014released in Spain as Maldita suerte\u2014 belongs to both. Edward Berger takes us to a hypnotic Macao of neon lights and endless roulette spins, where Colin Farrell plays a gambler trying to escape himself. He\u2019s superb: weary, ironic, and carrying the kind of melancholy only those who\u2019ve lost too much can understand.\n\nThe film moves with the rhythm of an elegant hangover. It\u2019s not about grand gestures, but about the quiet tremor of someone who\u2019s risked it all and keeps playing anyway. Berger directs with confidence, though at times he leans more toward style than substance. Even so, there\u2019s something hypnotic\u2014almost poetic\u2014in the way he frames addiction as a limbo between life and disappearance.\n\nTilda Swinton, as a sharp, unflappable detective, brings the necessary balance: calm, grounded, incisive. Her presence anchors the story and prevents the visual fever from collapsing under its own weight. Fala Chen adds a mysterious, dreamlike quality that makes the film\u2019s tone even more ethereal.\n\nNot everything works\u2014some stretches feel uneven or too deliberate\u2014but the result lingers thanks to its atmosphere. It\u2019s a journey through decadence and emotional ruin, where glances often say more than words.\n\nBallad of a Small Player is a story about losing, but also about the stubbornness to keep playing. Because sometimes, being human isn\u2019t about winning\u2014it\u2019s about daring to bet again.",

I will say that it was produced and directed well, however those who do not understand 1) the symbolism in the story and 2) Asian culture, may have a difficult time following. Colin Ferrell was a great cast for the this role as he just looks like a pathetic gambler. Tilda Swinson was okay, her role was minor.",

    "text": "\"Ballad of a Small Player\" does have a few qualities that I genuinely liked. I think the colors and visual aesthetic of the movie are consistently good, and I also think Colin Farrell is great in this. I think the issue with the movie is that the story just didn't feel engaging for me. I tried to get into the chaos it presented, but it felt less and less interesting as it went on. It is a shame because the movie looks visually great and features such strong acting, yet feels like it isn't enough. Overall, this is a disappointing follow-up for director Edward Berger and not close to the level of his other recent film outings.",

The concept of the festival may be foreign to western audiences but it was played out perfectly. With the actions perfectly aligned with someone that understood what salvation of the character looks like and would do. Colin act the heck out of the character once again! Even with a story and props that seemed daunting to take on, he brought in the grounded and realness to take the viewer on a wild ride.",

    "text": "2/5 STARS - Ballad of a Small Player isn\u2019t the psychological thriller it\u2019s being sold as \u2014 it\u2019s a beautifully crafted but deeply frustrating character drama. Colin Farrell gives a fantastic performance, and the cinematography is excellent, but I never clicked with the story or this self-destructive protagonist. By the time he finally seems to turn a corner, he makes new choices that left me shaking my head. Some people may appreciate the adaptation, but as a Goodreads user who reviewed the book says, \"There is a niche audience for this\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t include me.\" Video review: https://youtu.be/RixbjhW_100",
