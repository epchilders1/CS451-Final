Did they even bother to frame their shots or look at the background. Roads are seen in multiple places. Kayak skirts magically appear in the middle of rapids. Drops happen out of sequence. But the story was even more unbelievable.  And the acting was\u2026. Well at least there were the BAD whitewater scenes.",

This movie is terrible. Not only is the writing bad, there's just lacksadaisical shortfalls in the main parts of the scene of the most important scenes. The majority of the movie is centered around terrible or no decisions. We had to sit down and watch this movie in two parts and for each part I was standing and yelling. It's probably the worst movie I've seen all year. If I could give it zero Stars I would. The acting was a two at best but the movie itself was atrocious. That may be being generous. We should have watched The Minions. Mind you we have no children. If there's one thing I could leave you with, itis \"don't watch this movie\".",

    "text": "I will start off with the positives. For a \"remake\" the film does try to do its own thing, despite having a similar setting the characters and motivation are different. The camera work for most of the shots is also pretty good. Now that the positives are out of the way, let's get into it.\n\nThis movie feels like a studio realized that the rights they had to film was about to expire and they wanted to squeeze out something from it to make some money. So, they dusted off an old script that happened to take place on a river raft, kept the budget as low as possible and slap the recognizable title on it.\n\nThe movie takes its sweet time getting started. The main conflict of the story doesn't show signs of starting until about the 30-minute mark. For an hour and a half movie, that's 1/3 of the movie where nothing is happening but exposition.\n\nThese characters are the very example of what people talk about for stupid characters in a horror film. They're the kind of characters that make idiotic decisions that no one in real life would make, but they do it so the movie can happen. It makes you want to just pick up the screen and shake the characters, telling them \"No, don't do that!\"\n\nI guess one other benefit is that the movie is short. I will take its lead and keep this review short as well.",

No clue how this made it through production. I want my time back. Netflix should reimburse me for having to see this genuinely terrible movie.",

Meester is a good actress, Brody is good in everything. It's well shot and paced reasonably tense moments. There are plenty holes in the script and incredibly odd decisions by characters but its solid. Doesn't touch Kevin Bacon's original, now that's a movie.",
