But as a Black woman, I loved it. This film sparks the kind of conversations that need to be had, real, raw, and overdue. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, for sure.\n\nThat said, I have to be real, Nia Long deserved way more lines. Period. She\u2019s a star in her own right, and limiting her made certain parts of the film feel less authentic. Adding a few Black producers behind the scenes would\u2019ve easily pushed this movie into my top 10. Still, I give credit where it\u2019s due,  it made me think, feel, and talk. And that\u2019s what good storytelling should do.\n\nStop hating - lol . Great movie.",

I wanted to stop watching much earlier but I like Jonah Hill and was expecting some actually funny stuff from Eddie Murphy. It's sooo bright and all their clothes are new; it's irritating. Kenya Barris and his Blackish people made sure you feel their presence with soulless everything.",

The top review says it best: \"It's a social commentary and romantic comedy, but the movie can't seem to commit to either...\" (paraphrased)\n\nA lot of people commented about the insane lack of chemistry between the two main characters, which is fair. I mean, sometimes movies have bad direction and/or bad writing --It's not really the actors posing the problem. \n\nThere are quite a few cringe moments (but, for the love of God, it's gotten better since the early 2000s where the peak of \"black & white people are different \ud83e\udd2f\" comedy was like, a stuffy old granny who ends up wearing a sideways cap & rapping by the end of the movie \ud83d\ude06) and I was a bit upset that when his mother was trying really hard (TOO hard) she got super-angry. I get being tired of the perceived microaggressions, or maybe even afraid you're just another prop, but I feel like the anger just perpetuated the whole \"angry black woman vs. tiny, frail white woman\" thing, rather than sending a message against it. \n\nI'm glad it didn't have a s\u2022x scene. Not prudish, I just don't like watching other people b\u00aang \ud83d\ude05 It was a good \"popcorn movie.\" If you have a lazy weekend for once, grab a snack & let your brain rot for a while. One of these days we'll get the interracial love story correct...",

Most of the scenes that played out seemed like they belonged in a different decade. I don\u2019t think over 90% of Americans give a damn about so called, \u201cInter-racial relationships\u201d.

It gives us lessons in empathy and reflection, while also being a film that can make you laugh and think. Great performances by Jonah Hill and Lauren London. Recommended when you want to have a good time and end up with a positive attitude after watching it.",
