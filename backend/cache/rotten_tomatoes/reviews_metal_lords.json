The characters are funny, easy to connect with & as a metal music fan, I of course loved the sound track. Isis Hainsworth as Emily particularly shone for me. Overall it was an easy to watch fun movie full of friendship & metal music \ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\ude0a",

It\u2019s a truly the greatest heavy metal comedy with a fantastic metal thrasher soundtrack with a great original track. This film will hit instantly with hard core metal fans who are in to heavy metal and thrasher metal.",

    "text": "It's cringe, but it's good.\nMetal Lords is a coming-of-age comedy that blends the awkwardness of high school life with the rebellious spirit of metal music. It follows two socially awkward teens, Kevin and Hunter, who dream of starting a heavy metal band. The film captures the passion of youth and the subculture of metal while also addressing themes of friendship, self-discovery, and defying societal expectations. With a stellar soundtrack and humorous yet heartfelt moments, Metal Lords strikes a perfect balance between the joy of music and the challenges of growing up. The performances, particularly by Jaeden Martell and Adrian Greensmith, add depth to the characters, making it a fun, relatable watch for both metal fans and those who enjoy a quirky, teen-centric story.",

    "text": "I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from the 2022 comedy \"Metal Lords\" from writer D. B. Weiss and director Peter Sollett as I sat down to watch the movie. Why? Well, first of all I hadn't heard about the movie, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. And secondly, then the synopsis for the movie just seemed a bit too generic for a movie of this kind. But still, I opted to watch \"Metal Lords\".\n\nTurns out that \"Metal Lords\" was actually rather enjoyable. Sure, it was somewhat on the generic side in terms of innovation and creativity for a movie such as this. But still, it proved to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie. And that was definitely a large part because of the cast and their performances. But the storyline certainly was adequate enough.\n\nLead actors Adrian Greensmith (playing Hunter) and Jaeden Martell (playing Kevin) were rather well-cast for \"Metal Lords\", and they carried the movie quite well.\n\nI was genuinely entertained by \"Metal Lords\", because it was a movie that transcended being just another run-of-the-mill movie about youngsters forming a metal band and going against the mainstream. There were also good elements of friendship, love, being an outsider and not a bland face in the crowd, and such, so it was a well-rounded movie.",
