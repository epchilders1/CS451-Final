    "text": "The Call (2020) starts with an interesting idea \u2014 two women connected across time \u2014 but completely wastes its potential. The characters make one dumb decision after another, the logic collapses halfway through, and by the end you\u2019re left irritated instead of impressed. There\u2019s no real closure, no satisfaction, just chaos for the sake of shock. What could have been a tight, emotional thriller turns into a frustrating mess with zero payoff.\n\nIf you want a thriller where the characters actually think, watch Hush, Run, or 10 Cloverfield Lane instead.",

    "text": "It actually turned out to be a great movie. Found it by searching another movie, but I'm so glad that I bumped into this one. It was really worth it. The whole idea of this movie is not original. The similar concept was in the movie \"The Lake House\" (2006). But this movie is not a romance, it's a horror baby! And they took the whole idea to the whole another level and they nailed it. Besides everything what I mentioned, the acting was good and production was on point as well. U should definitely watch it.",

    "text": "The Call, adapted from the 2011 film The Caller, offers a gripping story of cross-time communication that alters the present in real time. While this concept creates suspense, it introduces major logical flaws\u2014such as memory inconsistencies and sudden resurrections\u2014that clash with established time-travel logic. Despite its plot issues, the film shines through stellar performances, particularly by Jong Seo, and strong visual execution, though the after-credit scene undermines what could have been a powerful ending.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)",

    "text": "This movie kept me entertained the whole time. I loved how it showed how fast a person can change in such a short time and go crazy. Overall this shows that the past should not be messed with and everything happens for a reason. The acting was really good, especially since this is Jeon Joong-Seo's second movie filmed. The emotions of all the actors were shown perfectly. The ending may be confusing to some people especially since I don't usually watch all of the credits.. In conclusion this movie is definitely worth watching.",

Eu achei um suspense muito bom. A inseguran\u00e7a da estabilidade do presente da protagonista \u00e9 a chave do desconforto do filme. Gostei demais dessa ideia de mexer com o futuro sabendo o passado, e conseguiram deixar uma hist\u00f3ria bem linear, com um assunto t\u00e3o complexo como esse, como j\u00e1 dito, ignorando totalmente o final.",

The plot was great. I really like how the two characters one from the future and one from the past had a conflict to each other. Like the killing scenes by the way. I definitely recommend this movie, really good!",

    "text": "I'm very happy I trusted the Tomatometer on this one. It was genius. Watched it in Korean w/Eng subtitles (cuz you need to know). I've always enjoyed time travel movies. You travel back, then butterfly-effect the \"present.\" But, \"The Call\" takes a different (original) spin on this, by using a telephone to span the 20-years between the (literally) tortured Oh Young-sook of 1999 and the (figuratively) tortured Kim Seo-yeon of 2019. My eager suspension-of-disbelief bought into this concept and its dramatic (horrific?) effects on both the present and the past. Very well done. Lots of wonderful tension. Is Oh Young-sook's shaman mother the villain of the piece? You'll have to stream it and find out....",
