By presenting all sides of the story, it delivers a gripping, fully rounded account that\u2019s as unsettling as it is fascinating.",

No-sorry-this one doesn\u2019t fly for me. I feel like I just spent all this time allowing a sociopath to explain herself (deceptively). This one should never have been aired.",

Otherwise, Netflix completely drops the ball on this one by making the heinous perp out to be a sympathetic character, and their terrifying manipulations in the interviews as some kind of reasonable explanation.

    "text": "The documentary crew chose to tell this story like a thriller with twists and turns rather than what it is - a disgusting act of child abuse. \n\nA mother cyberbullies her own daughter (and her daughter's boyfriend, among other CHILDREN) for over a year to the point of mental breakdown and suicidal ideation. But rather than paint her with her true colors, the documentary crew decided to interview her as if she were just a passenger along for the ride, instead of the perpetrator. The mother messaged incredibly vile, and sometimes NC-17 messages, to CHILDREN and yet she was given the benefit of the doubt and never pressed for a reason or what was going through her clearly sociopathic mind. The attitude read like, \"no big deal, it's in the past.\" Why they decided it was in good taste to give this monster a platform is beyond me. \n\nIrresponsible reporting at its finest. Would recommend steering clear of this one and reading more accurate, unbiased articles online. Shame on you, Netflix.",

Maybe that soured my view of it as I watched. However, the details behind everything, and the perspective of the antagonist is pretty intriguing. Although, the creative direction and showcasing of the story this film is describing is not handled very responsibly, and doesn't leave you with as unsettling of a feeling for the criminal as I feel like it should given the circumstances.",

    "text": "80%. 9/2/25. Knew who it was so took out some of the juice of the revelation. Super weird that the mom is interviewed early in the doc knowing it was her. Crazy in her defense she said a lot of people commit crimes and do things like drink and drive, she just got caught. Nuts comparison. Really weird too with the cop footage of them confronting the mom and the dad is most worked up about her lying about her job and not tormenting their daughter and telling her to kill herself. Seemed like the Mom was jealous the girl was prettier than her, was weirdly into her bf, and wanted her to need her. Such a strange story. 3/5 rewatch",
