I would like a book or a movie that would give more background information on Santa, the Easter Bunny, Tooth fairy, and the Sandman, that explored their origin stories. They do give us a peak in Jack's beginnings, though, and that's because he's the main focus. We get to see him grow as a character. It's a nice little fantasy story that has some action and wholesomeness packed into one. If you need a cozy movie night during Christmas or Easter,  I highly suggest this movie. It's perfect to watch alone or with your kids.",
