The action scenes were done poorly, felt like a low budget movie. In addition, it wasn\u2019t so bad too the point were it makes it more entertaining. Sometimes movies are so bad that they are good. One of the few good things was the plot wasn\u2019t all that bad.",

Please tell me Liam Nealson got paid a shed load  - because that can only be the reason he did this film! I watched until end as a) too late to switch to another film before flight landed; b) it started to get SO bad, it became comically entertaining!",

Todo artista em o seu auge e depois o declinio. O filme anterio de Miss\u00e3o Resgate (2021) ja deixou a desejar, mas neste conseguiu superar. Um mix de Speed (Keanu) e filmes de montanha. Neeson teve seu irm\u00e3o morto e cremado pediu para que suas cinzas fossem jogadas no Everest. E assim ele vai e tem uma guia Fan para leva-lo. Na hora que est\u00e3o indo o onibus \u00e9 sequestrado para eliminar um aldei\u00e3o que \u00e9 contra a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma represa para gerar energia. E assim a quadrilha passa a perseguir o grupo que foge, foge at\u00e9 n\u00e3o conseguir mais. At\u00e9 que ao final vencem os inimigos, apesar da perda. \nVale apena assistir?: tudo fraco, est\u00f3ria, enredo, cenas de lutas, tiros, efeitos e romance.\nNota: 3",

    "text": "This sequel to 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Ice Road\u201d sees Liam Neeson return to his role as big rig ice road driver Mike McCann, who travels to Nepal to scatter his late brother\u2019s ashes on Mt. Everest. Soon however, he and his tour guide, who conveniently has prior military experience, find themselves fighting off a gang of mercenaries holding their tour bus hostage.\n\nDespite a few decent action sequences, everything about this film was as forgettable as the original movie, which was actually more exciting than this sequel. There\u2019s no ice roads, there\u2019s no vengeance, lots of cheap CGI, poor visual effects, forgettable characters, ridiculous plot points. I love Liam Neeson, but even he couldn\u2019t save this drag of a movie.\n\nHonestly, skip this movie, you\u2019re not missing anything, you can just thank me for watching it so you don\u2019t have to",

    "text": "Oh wow, it's been that long since I last saw a Leam Neeson movie, and his iconic line:\n\"If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you\". \nGreat movies and was expecting something with the same caliber.\nThat's why when I saw this one I couldn't think anything but either he needed the money ( which I don't think he does) or he was plain bored and did it just because.\nTerrible writing, terrible plot. Terrible movie. Usual Leam but the terrible acting from the rest of actors don't help him.\nNow, you have nothing to do? Ok, watch it.",

    "text": "ICE ROAD: VENGEANCE is an unabashed genre action flick, as the title indicates. Like its 2021 predecessor, this second movie finds a plausible enough premise to get Mike McCann back on the (ice) road, this time in Nepal's Himalayas. The acting is uneven, and the movie often feels formulaic, but it has a great setting and enough momentum to again provide a serviceable weekday action-thriller.",
