    "text": "OK, the joke is obvious - this movie failed to launch, though it was pleasant most of the time. In fact, it was just a minor romcom with major actors a bit before their prime (Matthew McConnaughey, Bradley Cooper) and little chemistry between the romantic pairs, especially Matthew and Sarah Jessica Parker. Brazilians will understand: it was a bit like a Globo movie - nice-looking people and very little depth. And I really didn't understand what exactly the consultant Sarah was trying to achieve or how to get the guy to leave his parents' home.",

This thing is so excruciating, you gotta wonder how these actors' careers even survived. How many date nights went limp after after this torture of cliches? The acting's fine, but the writing drags it all down like shoes of concrete.",

    "text": "A simply OK film, though the last 20/30 minutes or so does drag a tad.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is good, Sarah Jessica Parker is good, the support cast (which includes an early role of Bradley Cooper's) are good. I didn't overly enjoy what I was watching, but I wasn't particularly bored with it either. I don't really have much to say about it in truth.\n\nAt around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. That makes it a watchable, if slightly forgettable, flick from 2006 in my books.",

Seeing as he's the most perfect in all situations, it's only natural he falls for every woman in a professional standing better than his own so a modern day woman or a gold digger, of fools. The only thing worse than Sarah pretending she doesn't need a roommate or a man- is having one worse than the coo coo birds \ud83d\udc26 insanity - Zooey, pretending acting is letting out every inch of your insanity - bc shooting birds is perfectly normal, from your window, bc it's natural- to assume everyone can fix your problems- with a wrench and a hammer \ud83d\udd28 \ud83d\udd28, or from the pleasant way you're the \"girl next door\" - or not - just an open door away from, a constant therapy session, it's not so new - or mocking bird cry - probably telling you something, it sounds better than your music . \ud83c\udfb6 \ud83c\udfb6 \ud83c\udfb8 in total everything Matthew has done is Oscar worthy, worthy of the gold shimmer to get it there, and that's about it - a scream, cry and good hand dealt from a woman in his favour - lacking value. \ud83e\udd21",

    "text": "Failure to Launch (2006) continues to sit at the forefront of the rom-com genre over a decade later, thanks to a unique, if unbelievable concept and a solid casting effort from top to bottom, despite a lackluster script.\n\nThe movie stars Matthew McConaughey as a 35-year-old who still lives with his parents, and Sarah Jessica Parker as a woman hired by his parents to date him and get him to move out. \n\nIn addition to its two co-stars, Failure to Launch features a remarkable ensemble cast of supporting characters, including Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, Terry Bradshaw, and Kathy Bates. It also happens that most of those actors are wasted in their roles, but the movie definitely benefits from them.\n\nFailure to Launch won't break your heart. While it has its human moments, including a twist on why McConaughey won't move out, it doesn't carry much weight scene-to-scene. Additionally, it's only average in its humor, and a lot of it is quite cheesy, particularly our protagonist's frequent animal assaults.\n\nDespite only being an average film, it has that \"it factor\" that makes it enjoyable over multiple viewings, even if it won't make anyone's favorites list. I give it 4 out of 5 stars for \"creative and unique situations, funny if comedy, high quality, but not iconic or exceptional.\"",
