Weird and didn\u2019t contribute to the storyline. Zombies didn\u2019t appear until about an hour in and even then it was idiotic. I would give 0 stars if I could",

Dry, unfunny, boring I just wasted my night off on this horrible movie. Plot had so much potential too. Do not waste your time.",

And it's not just the zombies...\n\nFeatures Jim Jarmusch's dry humor as well as a stacked cast including Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, and others.   The pacing is slow but that's intentional.  There will be things that make you say, \"huh?\" but they will be answered by film's end.  Also some subtle Easter eggs.   I'm fairly sure Driver channels Christopher Walken in one scene.  Not a horror film for those looking for only that.",

Bill Murray didn't seem like he gave a damn about this. The writing was atrocious. And I swear the actors were reading cue cards instead of actually studying a script. At least \"The Dead Don't Die\" song was catchy.",

It has an all-star cast, in-depth and stunningly insightful dialogue, scorching political and social commentary, edge of your seat story line, and an astounding musical score.  I wept, laughed, and hugged my family throughout. Bravo, Jim Jarmusch. Bravo.",

But you know it's going to be the best when the opening joke is pointing out that they are aware it's a movie...\n\nI think it could have been good if it had ever picked up any kind of momentum, not Resident Evil \"kill-everything-you-see\", but something... But regardless of how bad things got, it just didn't pick up any speed.\n\nIt didn't have a lot of anything going on, a lot of started ideas, but nothing that got followed through... It was just easier to kill of all plot hooks.\n\nIt was fun to see Steve Buscemi in a (not-)MAGA hat though",

Because of human craziness in tech? Ok. Aliens? In one scenentgey keep talking in the talk, in the next scene they are surrounded bs zombies and cant flee? In one scene they kill zombies with no problems, than they loose just like that? No it is bad. It could be a good one, but this is really really bad directed and the cuts are aweful. Shame. I really wanted to like it. I mean c'mon. Adam Driver (a wonderful actor) and bill (fing) murray..... Damn.",

The social commentary hits with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and the satire has about as much bite as a toothless zombie. Thankfully, the cast manages to wring a few laughs out of the material they were handed.",
