Em uma cidade dominada por Herod (Hackman) e seu bando. E agora tem uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o do gatilho mais r\u00e1pido e v\u00e1rios cowboys est\u00e3o na cidade para participar e ao vencedor ganhar\u00e1 uma bolada. Mas temos 2 pessoas que est\u00e3o por outro motivo Cort esta como ref\u00e9m de HErod e for\u00e7ado a participar e Ellen que esta por vingan\u00e7a. Para se vingar de Herod que no passado quando ela era uma crian\u00e7a viu seus pais serem mortos por Herod. E para sua vingan\u00e7a ela se tornou uma pistoleira. E assim a competi\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7a e os principais, v\u00e3o vencendo. At\u00e9 chegar um dia onde pai e filho ir\u00e3o duelar e estamos falando de Herod e Kid, e Herod nem seu pr\u00f3prio filho polpa. At\u00e9 chegar na \u00faltima disputa entre Herod e Ellen. E ela conta toda est\u00f3ria da vingan\u00e7a e quem vence? N\u00e3o foi dos melhores faroeste e tamb\u00e9m a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de Stone. Mas as atua\u00e7\u00f5es de Caprio, Hackman e Russel s\u00e3o boas.\nVale apena assistir? sim, para ver estas estrelas.\nNota: 7",

The casting is top-notch\u2014Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, and a young Leonardo DiCaprio\u2014but the weak script wastes them, cramming in too many underdeveloped characters. The cinematography has style, but showy gimmicks (like unnecessary slow-mo paired with cheesy zoom effects) undercut its impact. The premise\u2014a female gunslinger in a male-dominated revenge tale\u2014had real potential, but instead of depth or tension, we get a repetitive shootout competition. A more fitting title?

    "text": "This movie has such a cool premise for a western. Basically, a town sets up a March Madness style bracket of dueling gunfights. It is such a dumb idea; I can't help but love it. This is then executed with a diverse cast of colorful characters that make each showdown memorable. This is helped by an all-time great cast. Hackman, DiCaprio, Crowe, Stone, Henriksen and Keith David are all actors that bring real life to every role they play. Combining the premise with the characters is Sam Rami's signature visual style. This leads to some crazy camera movements and kinetic energy that makes the movie never dull.",

Oscar winners acting very well and a supporting cast of snarling stereotypes who you know will get knocked off lone by one leaving a very stupid, improbably but stylish ending. Entertaining enough but with those stars and the budget involved, it amounts to little more than a check-your-brains-at-the-door time waster",

Raimi does a lot of interesting, nontraditional shots and effects with the shooting (including some wildly long dolly zooms, which is pretty fun). A very young DiCaprio and a young Russel Crowe are pretty awesome characters, too, and Keith David's performance as an itinerant duelist is terrific.",
