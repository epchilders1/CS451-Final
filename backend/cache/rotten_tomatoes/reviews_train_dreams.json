I found myself going online in the middle of the movie to ask basic questions about the plot and what happened to certain characters. Huge Red Flags. \n\nIs this one of those movies where the producer and the studio comes in and changes everything at the last minute, cause maybe that would explain the pacing, the lack of a concise plot, the unanswered questions, the terrible ambiguity...\n\n\nSpoiler: After the fire, why didn't the main character look for his wife and kids in town? Why didn't he check with her family, with the police, with anyone? He didn't post flyers, he didn't do anything except sleep at the cabin. He didn't check the hospitals, the morgue....he didn't do anything to look for his family. How about the church? Then the narrator tells us that years went by. It's just bad story telling.\n\nReminds me of Homer from the Simpsons. \"Marge! I can't find the remote. I've tried nothing, and I'm all out of ideas.\" \n\nAlso, the scene where he walks into the forest fire really threw me out of the immersion. So fake. That's not how fires and oxygen works, but ok guys. Maybe the directors should have done some research on fires, forest fires, oxygen, etc... Maybe they could have talked to some fire fighters.... anyways. \n\nBoring movie, with no plot, except plot armor, with terrible vague story telling that made me take my phone out to ask A.I. what is happening.",

    "text": "\u201cTrain Dreams\u201d 2025\n\nStrange dreams was a movie set back in the early 1900s I don\u2019t know the western part of The US. A time where people had to go far away from your home to find work. So this story centers around a man and his family trying to raise a family in an era where hard work and scarcity of money were the norm. This particular story centered around a man who traveled far and wide to find work as a lumberjack. A profession that was not for the faint of heart as It was a very dangerous occupation. This is when railroads were starting to be built and bridges were made to connect cities. This was the story from the perspective of one lumberjack and his family and the hardships that faced them. Pretty good film although not a lot of action more like a movie biography in a way of early history in America. But I gave this film an 8 out of 10 stars. It probably really depicted the Life and Times of early 1900s in western America.",

The beauty of the land, the colour of memory. It\u2019s as powerful as There Will Be Blood, it\u2019s as painful as Requiem for a dream, it\u2019s pure genius. It will win many Oscar\u2019s but who cares. It\u2019s a truly beautiful film.",

    "text": "I'm still trying to figure out why this film was called \"Train Dreams\". Aside from the underlying history of Western expansion, this film wasn't about trains. In fact, the only thing really interesting about the film was the tapestry of the passage of time during a lifetime that saw some incredible changes across cultural, social, and technological advances. I didn't find the film deep or even particularily emotional, rather I found it strangely disconnected ... which may have been a direct result of the overall lack of dialogue.",

Plodding pathos and One Big Tragedy, unleavened by any hints of wisdom or redemption, surprisingly makes for bad storytelling.   Honestly, who is the intended audience for this film?  Nihilistic Loggers of America?  Artsy eastern Oregon?  My time would have been better spent reading obituaries.",

The chemistry between Edgerton and Jones is amazing, and I loved watching William Macy and John Diehl. Edgerton is only about 5\" taller than Jones, yet he seems visually, physically to be a bear of a man to her small, slender fawn of a woman. Kerry Condon is remarkable in a smaller role, and I thought for a while that she and Edgerton would develop an intimate relationship, especially when they are up on the fire tower, but then I realize he's meant to be alone with his memories and faint hope.",

    "text": "I agree with the reviewers who found this movie disappointing.  The plot of the movie was disjoint.  It used narration to try to tie the episodes of the story together, but the narration did not achieve that end.  It was too self-consciously literary, and therefore somewhat pretentious.  The minor characters were not that well defined, so the plot did not hold together well after the death of Robert's wife and child.  The movie was too self-consciously arty to keep me invested in the story of Robert's life.",

Touching and tender performances by Joel Edgerton should definitely get him a nomination for an oscar. For me, this movie is a moving piece of art that is a stark contrast to our current times and culture which is so dependent on technology and progress fueled by greed and a materialism.  I believe this movie will resonate with most people's sense of what makes life beautiful and meaningful.",

The narration feels to be part of the problem, \"he was one with the meaningfulness of the time and yet he had the understanding of a wistful lake who could not understand it's own meaningless in a field full of trees that do not worry nor....\" you get the idea.",
