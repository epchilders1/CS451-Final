But it gains extra bonus points for the spectacular boobs on show from mother and daughter. Great genetics and added something worthwhile to this all round boob of a film. Watched on DVD.",

    "text": "San Andreas was a surprise for me. Going in, I assumed it would be a typical disaster movie: lots of explosions, shaky storylines, and characters who exist purely to scream while things collapse around them. What I got, however, was a high-octane, emotional, and genuinely entertaining film that managed to balance heart with spectacle in a way few disaster movies manage. From the very first scene, you\u2019re thrown into tension and chaos, but it\u2019s grounded by characters you actually care about.\n\nDwayne Johnson continues to prove why he\u2019s one of the most compelling action stars working today. Here, he\u2019s not just the muscle or the comic relief\u2014he\u2019s a fully fleshed-out father figure, desperate to save his family amidst catastrophic earthquakes that tear through California. What I appreciated most is that Johnson brings vulnerability to the role. You can see his fear, frustration, and determination in his eyes. This isn\u2019t just about him dodging falling buildings or jumping out of helicopters\u2014it\u2019s about a father\u2019s love and sacrifice. That emotional thread runs consistently through the chaos, giving the movie stakes beyond CGI destruction.\n\nCarla Gugino, as Emma, brings a grounded presence that balances Johnson\u2019s intensity. She\u2019s calm, rational, and resourceful in the face of absolute disaster. Their chemistry works really well, making their shared scenes feel realistic and emotionally resonant. Alexandra Daddario, playing their daughter, is a revelation. She manages to portray fear, bravery, and determination all at once, and her performance elevates scenes that could have easily felt clich\u00e9 or overacted. You feel invested in her survival\u2014not just because she\u2019s the damsel in distress, but because she has agency and demonstrates clever problem-solving throughout.\n\nThe supporting cast adds even more layers to the film. Hugo Johnstone-Burt as Ben gives a grounded, heroic presence, embodying the everyday person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Art Parkinson, who plays Ollie, shines as the younger brother\u2014he\u2019s genuinely brave and resourceful, providing moments of levity and hope in a film that could have easily felt relentlessly grim. These characters are not just window dressing for destruction; they are the emotional glue that makes the movie worth caring about.\n\nThe direction and pacing deserve high praise. The filmmakers understand how to build tension and then release it with spectacular payoff. The earthquake sequences are genuinely terrifying and exhilarating. Watching entire buildings crumble, fires rage through streets, and cars tossed into the air creates an immersive experience that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The way these sequences are staged shows meticulous attention to detail\u2014every collapse, every explosion, every small human interaction feels purposeful. There\u2019s a sense that the filmmakers understand that spectacle without story is meaningless, and they make sure you never lose sight of the people caught in the chaos.\n\nOf course, the screenplay isn\u2019t perfect. There are moments that lean on clich\u00e9s, and a few plot conveniences exist to move the story along. Some dialogue feels a little too on-the-nose or dramatic, and a few secondary characters could have been better developed. But these are minor issues when you consider the overall impact of the film. The movie\u2019s heart is strong enough to carry it through these imperfections. The combination of personal stakes, disaster chaos, and the subtle humor sprinkled throughout makes for a surprisingly well-rounded experience.\n\nThe special effects deserve special mention. For a film that came out in 2015, the CGI is impressive and often seamless. Earthquakes, collapsing bridges, towering tsunamis, and urban destruction are all rendered with a visceral quality that makes you feel the danger. The filmmakers also wisely use practical effects and stunt work alongside CGI, grounding the spectacle in reality and making it feel more immediate and intense. This approach elevates the movie above many other disaster films that rely too heavily on digital effects alone.\n\nBeyond the technical and emotional aspects, San Andreas succeeds because it never forgets its core story: family. The earthquakes, tsunamis, and fires are terrifying, yes\u2014but the real tension comes from watching this family navigate impossible circumstances and do everything they can to survive. That makes every moment of danger feel more impactful. You\u2019re not just watching skyscrapers fall\u2014you\u2019re watching parents fight to keep their children alive, children fight to help their parents, and everyone involved face moral and physical challenges that feel grounded despite the over-the-top events.\n\nEven the smaller moments stand out. The way the film briefly pauses to allow characters to communicate, strategize, or even joke amid the destruction gives it a human touch. These pauses prevent the movie from feeling like an endless parade of explosions, which is a trap many disaster films fall into. Here, there\u2019s room for tension, relief, and emotional resonance, and that\u2019s why the film sticks with you.\n\nIn the end, San Andreas is more than just a thrilling action movie\u2014it\u2019s an emotionally engaging disaster adventure. It\u2019s a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, while also giving you a reason to care about the people experiencing the chaos. From the performances of Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, and Alexandra Daddario, to the careful direction, well-executed stunts, and immersive special effects, this film delivers a complete experience. It\u2019s one of the better disaster films of its era and is genuinely fun, exciting, and emotional all at once.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never given San Andreas a proper chance, it\u2019s worth watching\u2014not just for the earthquakes, but for the human stories at its core. It\u2019s a thrilling ride, and one that proves a disaster movie can have both spectacle and heart in equal measure.",

    "text": "Cheesy action movie plot. Typical devices, man and woman separated by a loss of a daughter, seek to prevent it from happening again with their other daughter and come back together.  There were so many moments where \"if something could go wrong it would\" that by the tsunami scene when the container ship crested the wave top, I started laughing hysterically at the absurdity.\nBut, with that said - I do like Dwayne Johnson and this movie had some of the best CGI I have seen in a long long time. (and I work in computers including computer graphics). While the various premises and scenes were highly unplausible, it is a movie and it is an action movie. And what the absurdity lacks the cgi makes up for so I gave it 4 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "The 2015 film \u201cSan Andreas\u201d directed by Brad Peyton is a riveting disaster story that follows the aftermath of a massive earthquake that destroyed California. The magnitude 9 earthquake is triggered by the San Andreas Fault line  and tears apart the city. Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson stars as Ray Gaines, the search and rescue pilot who is fearlessly trying to find his lost wife and daughter. The film, being more recent, has much better special effects and is depicted in a somewhat believable manner. The fault line is shown in a very dramatic way to leave a bigger impact on the audience and keep them engaged. The movie features many tools used in seismology by real scientists. \n\tThough the film is exaggerated for cinematic effect, it does portray the dangers and risks associated with living on an active fault line. California is at greater risk for earthquakes being that it is located directly on the fault of the North American and Pacific plates fault line. The film, while visually impressive, does simplify many real geological processes. For example, the quick succession of earthquakes and their immediate impacts may misrepresent the intricacies of seismic activity. In actuality, earthquake magnitude and frequency can vary widely, and the aftermath is usually defined by extended recovery efforts rather than immediate chaos. Despite these misconceptions, \"San Andreas\" effectively increases awareness about the risks posed by natural disasters. \n\tSomething that really draws in viewers during this film is how humans respond in a crisis. Watching characters experience and navigate hardships that are unimaginable to many is always interesting. Ray\u2019s determination to find his family through all the chaos highlights how important it is to have a plan in disaster situations. The movie illustrates how people come together and support one another which is an important element for survival in situations like this. One thing to learn from this film is how important it is to be prepared. During the film, characters show different levels of preparing for the impending tragedy.   This emphasizes the need for community emergency preparedness, such as evacuation routes and communication systems. The film urges viewers to think about their own readiness for natural catastrophes, promoting the fact that early preparation can save lives.",

No real wow moments/ moments which stood out. The writing was mid with a lot of cringy overly used one-liners which were way too predictable. The CGI is pretty impressive, though. The amount used is insane and is this movies' saving grace. The story it-self is well thought of, but the plot and writing really ruin the movie. A movie I would watch again, but only to see the impressive GCI and how the catastrophic events look/play out. If you want to see a cool looking movie with great film quality, this is a one to watch, just try and look past the low effort acting/writing.\n5/10",
