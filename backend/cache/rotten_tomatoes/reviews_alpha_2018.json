    "text": "I saw this listed in the filmography of Natassia Malthe, and I wondered what it was about. So, I took a look at the synopsis and had to admit it looked interesting.\n\n18000 BC. A tribe of humans participates in a hunt that sees its chief\u2019s son to prove the mettle of his worth. The son is a sweet young man, but in this savage world, a man must prove himself with his hands as much as his heart. It would appear that the son, in an act of foolishness, gets separated from the pack, but it is reliance on a canine that he refers to as Alpha that leads him home.\n\nThis was profoundly amazing. So much great acting over modest to most distinguished performers. I don\u2019t know how else to describe this other than genius filmmaking. A well spent time.",

It leaves no emotion untouched as the actors brought their A game camera performance.  Kodi Smit-McPhee makes you believe.  He is one to watch.  The wolf performace was also very above average.  I enjoyed watching and taking their journey.",

    "text": "Kodi Smit-McPhee stars in the movie \"Alpha,\" which presents a unique culture with its own distinct language. At first, the dialogue can be quite perplexing, as it often feels like the characters are communicating in a dog-like manner, using a dialect they've crafted themselves.\n\nHowever, the film is impressively directed, and once you start to grasp the underlying concepts, it becomes quite engaging. You can really see the emotions on the faces of both the parents and the children, which adds depth to their drama and action-packed journey, allowing viewers to connect with their powerful interactions.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, effectively immersing the audience in this vibrant world. The filmmakers did a remarkable job of bringing it to life, making you feel like you were part of the experience, whether you intended to be or not. You find yourself drawn in from the very beginning, captivated by the meticulous craftsmanship of the film.",

Have a lot of respect for ancestors who had to go through all this to survive. A new appreciation for food and how easily we are able to access it today.",

Completely detached from reality; if you like caveman fantasy, well, I guess you're in for a treat. I am aghast with how well it is rated here. The acting was fine, but the writing... my goodness.",
