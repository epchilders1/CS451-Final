    "text": "Thanksgiving movie! I remember wondering when this came out why it didn't get a ton of attention. Now that I'm rewatching it a decade plus later, I understand why. The heist is underwhelming, the whole story feels one-note and the supporting cast is somewhat forgettable.\n\nAll of that aside, I actually really enjoyed this movie. I'll watch anything starring Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy provided a few good laughs and I find myself quoting Matthew Broderick's Mr. Fitzhugh more often than I realized. There are some good third-act payoffs as well. \n\nNot great, not bad, but still an enjoyable \"holiday\" flick. \n\nBest Character: Mr. Fitzhugh\nBest Quote: \" I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw, but we don't accept tips at the tower.\" -  Dev'Reaux\nBest Scene: Prepping for the Heist\nBest Piece of Score: \"Theme from Tower Heist\"",

    "text": "I literally logged in for the first time just to write a review and raise the audience score of this movie. \n\nAudiences are silly. This is a *great* popcorn heist movie with an airtight script. From Stiller as the building manager/heist coordinator to Murphy as the criminal subject matter expert to Leoni as the lead investigator to Alda as the smarmy villain, and every bit part in between, everyone nails their respective characters. \n\nIts audience score is more criminal than the finance bro villain of the movie itself. God, it'd make for a great sequel.",

    "text": "Tower Heist cuenta con cientos de huecos argumentales y guionazos para que la historia avance, pero logra ser emocionante, una historia de reminiscencia con toques de comedia igual de bien implementados c\u00f3mo su acci\u00f3n, y para mi es lo que la vuelve especial, el compaginar ese toque m\u00e1s de thriller con tintes de comedia para volver accesible esta historia a todo el p\u00fablico. A estas alturas creo que todos somos conscientes del cine de Ben Stiller y Eddie Murphy; y creo que, si entramos en la convenci\u00f3n de su propio subg\u00e9nero que ellos mismos han creado, esta historia cumple a creces, pero si hay expectativas de un buen thriller con tintes noventeros esta historia es todo lo contrario, lo cual no es malo. Yo creo que el mismo p\u00fablico y la cr\u00edtica han desvalorizado el g\u00e9nero de la comedia c\u00f3mo tal, y para m\u00ed ser\u00eda una pena el subestimar el talento de Ben Stiller y Eddie Murphy en esta industria, ellos demostraron que sin importar el g\u00e9nero, una historia entra\u00f1able siempre preceder\u00e1. Esta historia est\u00e1 lejos de ser perfecta, pero la misma logra hacer que pases un buen momento.",

    "text": "I personally love this movie. It's a great cast Ben Stiller, Eddy Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena, and Casey Affleck. Hmmm, so why do I love this movie? 1. it was filmed on location, so many movies today are filmed in a giant green screen, or way too much CGI. This movie gives a pretty good sense of how New York Feels or should I say \"used to feel\". Pre Covid\u2026 NY ain't it nowadays. 2. Where else can you see this all star cast together? 3. It's a fun movie, many of the critics on here gave this movie a low score because the \"script\" wasn't up to par but this is a Family Movie, I wasn't expecting a complex psychological heist. Overall this is a fun great movie. Lastly I am a very difficult person to please so my stamp of approval on this movie means a lot. So you ever want to see Ben Stiller running around in a comedic hyjinx movie. Check this out.",
