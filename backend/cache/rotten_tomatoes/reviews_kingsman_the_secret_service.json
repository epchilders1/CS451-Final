    "text": "This movie wants to do everything. It is a parody, satire, epic summer smash, spy movie, drama, and tale of becoming a man. I know some of that is purposeful, and tongue in cheek. The soundtrack is reused from the Avengers, to which it was much more suited. The combat is ridiculous, which would be fine it this was like Austin Powers or Top Secret!\n\nHowever this wants to send up spy movies and 'epic' hero movies, but also wants to be that thing it is making fun of. \n\nA shame as I liked elements of what was done here, but as a whole it is an overbearing mess.",

    "text": "Properly paced, action packed and exciting, Sir Matthew Vaughn\u2019s comic book series makes the leap to film with charm. Embellishing on the hallmarks of the Bond franchise, Kingsman blends extravagant style with arrogance in a playful poke at the spy genre which isn\u2019t afraid to criticize itself or British institutions.\n\nMemeable in its portrayal of the capable gentlemen, this film presents character thru performance. Despite some hiccups mid screenplay, Kingsman is generally relentless in its execution, standing as an example of proper pacing in a motion picture. Kingsman keeps it\u2019s audience glued to the screen, with enthusiasm, lore, spectacle and parody. The absolutely stunning cast (everyone from the protagonist to the extras) keeps it real and relatable in this film. Dialogue is delivered naturally, the script is concise and the narrative surprises. \n\nWith an over the top nefarious villain, an evil lair full of henchman, stylish secret agents, and a narrative that aims to include the next generation of the United Kingdom, Kingsman is nothing short of a modern movie masterpiece; introducing us to the spy genre enjoyably, thru short, meaningful exposition (as well as timely, interesting subplot), while earnestly parodying spy films.\n\nKingsman is blessed with excellent cinematography, including an incredible fight scene. Jackie Chan's stunt choreographer, Brad Allan, collaborated with Matthew Vaughn to create a seven minute free-for-all. After careful and tedious editing, the resulting three minutes are an almost uninterrupted action sequence which impresses. These kind of \u201csingle-take\u201d scenes are uncommon (see the intro in the film Serenity (2005 film)), require extensive effort, but raise film industry standards. The continuous shot gives a complex, fluid, and immersive experience to the melee.\n\nKingsman manages to blend violence and comedy in an exciting, untroubling fashion. The film is a love letter to classic spy films, and is exceptional in its methodical introduction to a spy agency. This film is rated R, and is best for suited for ages 17 and up.\n\n(I give Kingsman: The Secret Service 9 out of 10 for excellence in the action and comedy genres. A point is deducted for some turbulence in pacing, resulting in some loss of interest.)",

    "text": "One of my favorite spy films of all time, Kingsman: The Secret Service delivers with a clear and confident tone, top-notch action scenes, and my favorite performance by Colin Firth. It\u2019s an absolute must-see.\n\nEssentially a comic book version of James Bond, Kingsman embraces its over-the-top style and runs with it. The villain may be more mustache-twirling than truly menacing, but that exaggerated quality fits perfectly within the film\u2019s universe.\nWhile the movie is strong overall, one scene stands above the rest\u2014the infamous church scene. Set to \"Free Bird\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, this one-shot action set piece is a masterclass in choreography, pacing, and style. It\u2019s frenetic, brutal, and quite possibly the best one shot I have ever seen. Honestly, I could watch it on a loop forever.\n\nThe overarching plot doesn\u2019t break new ground. If you\u2019ve seen a few spy or action films, you\u2019ll likely guess where it\u2019s going. But  Kingsman makes up for with flair, personality and humor. It takes familiar genre tropes and presents them in wildly inventive, stylized ways.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something visually exciting, genuinely funny, and packed with standout performances and unforgettable action, Kingsman: The Secret Service should be high on that list.",

If you have an issue with really scary movies and you think this might be an issue for you, I really don\u2019t think it will be because although there\u2019s a lot of violence, it\u2019s leaning more towards slapstick and extremist comedy as opposed to just straight gore, and it\u2019s just overall so good. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of super scary things but this was a million out of 10. not scary at all and just such a good watch.",

    "text": "Kingsman refreshes the spy genre with a youthful twist and a borderline comical yet villainous turn from Samuel L. Jackson. The breakout star, Taron Egerton, conveys a happy-go-lucky persona that evolves into a character who ought to be taken seriously. The trials and tribulations he goes through compose a compelling arc. Not to mention, Colin Firth's caliber is showcased as he deftly exercises his own unique spy etiquette. Their student-mentor relationship is written to great effect.",
