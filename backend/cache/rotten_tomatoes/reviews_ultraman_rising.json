    "text": "Ultraman: Rising, released in 2024, is an animated feature that I found to be pretty creative. It does a good job of shining a light on Ultraman while also giving audiences a brand-new character to root for. That was one of the things I appreciated about it: it wasn\u2019t just relying on nostalgia\u2014it tried to offer something fresh. I think the problem with why this animation didn\u2019t land as strongly with younger viewers\u2014or why it didn\u2019t continue to build a bigger following\u2014wasn\u2019t due to the characters or the storytelling. The characters were fine, the story was fine, but the length of the film was a major stumbling block.\n\nAnimated films tend to hit their stride around an hour and forty-five minutes. That\u2019s a runtime that keeps kids engaged and still appeals to adults who enjoy animated features for nostalgia or artistic value. But once you push past that, it starts to feel like a lot. You lose some of the audience\u2019s attention, especially the younger crowd. Adults can stick with it for the artistic value or for the story\u2019s callbacks, but even for them, sitting through an extended two-hour animated feature that doesn\u2019t absolutely justify its runtime is challenging. And in this case, the storyline didn\u2019t quite drive the need for that extra time.\n\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t a \u201cbad\u201d film. It\u2019s not poorly made, and it\u2019s certainly not a failure. The visuals are engaging, the new character is interesting, and there are parts that feel genuinely exciting and emotional. But by the time you get to the last forty minutes of the film, it feels like it should have wrapped up much earlier. That\u2019s the main issue\u2014the film\u2019s length makes it hard to stay fully invested. It delivers enough to be entertaining, but it doesn\u2019t maintain that engagement all the way through.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes. It\u2019s worth seeing, especially for fans of Ultraman or those curious about the new character. But it\u2019s also the kind of film where, after finishing it, you might not be eager to rewatch it. It\u2019s not the type of animated feature that becomes a repeat favorite the way something like K-Pop: Demon Hunters might be. The enjoyment is there, but it\u2019s limited by the pacing and runtime.\n\nIn the end, Ultraman: Rising is a creative and interesting animated film that does enough right to be worth watching, but it stretches just a bit too long for what it delivers. It\u2019s solid, enjoyable, and imaginative, but it doesn\u2019t quite have the momentum or staying power to make it a film you\u2019ll revisit over and over again.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the Sci-fi genre... well executed Sci-fi. Stumbled upon this for movie night with my 6 year old daughter. I'm not a huge baseball fan so was skeptical at first. But the storyline is unique and with a engaing well executed script. The futuristic animation is excellent. Reminded me a bit of style in Ghost in the Shell. I appreciated the underlying themes... family, balance, good over evil- a nice positive break from current state of local politics and world affairs. Solid family night story for all ages.",

    "text": "*Ultraman: Rising* surprised me\u2014in a good way. As someone who's never seen anything from the Ultraman franchise, I came in for the kaiju chaos but stayed for the unexpected heart. It's got emotional depth, cool fights, and just enough charm to keep you invested. Sure, the quality dips here and there, but you can feel the love poured into every frame. Newcomers will find it accessible, and I bet longtime fans will be thrilled. It's not perfect, but it\u2019s definitely solid. Think of it as a warm hug from a giant hero. Fingers crossed for a sequel\u2014I\u2019m in.",

    "text": "This movie genuinely changed the way I looked at myself. I always tried to be Ultraman, transforming myself to be all big and tough looking, but inside, was a hollow and shallow little boy that does it all for attention like Sato. \n\nIt made me cry in a way that I haven't in forever. I was shouting and hollering like a newborn baby, begging for my mom to come back, but she never will. I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for her to come back and be the mom I knew and loved during 7th grade, but I knew she won't. I struggled trying to deal with it like Ultraman and not the person inside. A big persona for a small personality. All the pent up stress building up and exploding all at once. Just like Sato.",

My experience watching it was thoroughly enjoyable, as the film combines spectacular action sequences with heartfelt storytelling.\n\nThe vibrant CG animation draws strong inspiration from the Spiderverse films, creating a dynamic visual style that kept me captivated throughout. The characters are well-developed, particularly Ken, who serves as a relatable model for responsibility and forgiveness. I appreciated how the film balances humor and emotional depth, making it suitable for viewers of all ages.\n\nWhile the pacing occasionally felt uneven, the overall narrative was engaging and kept me invested in the characters' journeys. The action scenes are exhilarating, showcasing Ultraman's iconic battles in a way that feels fresh and exciting.\n\nOverall, Ultraman: Rising is a fantastic addition to the franchise that successfully combines family-friendly entertainment with sophistication.
