It's about redemption, family and finding new purpose. \nFrankly this movie makes me feel more than a movie like this has any right to and it's earned every last star.",

I cannot stress how much of this movie is delivered with a character yelling into a camera less than a foot from their face. Hugh Jackman yells 80%+ of his lines, and the kid isn't far behind. It begins to grind on the ears and eyes. Pass.",

    "text": "A Hidden Gem Classic. This is not what you expect it to be. Some sort of Pacific Rim/Transformers knockoff. It's actually a sport movie (Rocky) mixed with some Sci-Fi (Transformers) and a family movie. any movie you've ever seen with a father/son on the road bonding from Chef to Over the Top, you'd get this. I can't say I've ever seen something like it. The editing is really well done and everything else is suprisngly solid about it. Lilly is really good, the special effects are really well done on the bots, and it weaves between the robot fighting and father/son drama perfectly. If anything the father/son drama is the most interesting parts. the characters are all likeable, it's super heart warming also. If there is one big flaw here is if you've ever seen any sports movie or any father/son movie you know exactly how this is going to go. The world outside of the robot fighting also is kind of forgettable as well. Also some of the \"villians\" like Zeus's owners, the loan shark, and the other oppenents are all kind of forgettable. The plot line of the robot having self awareness feels super underdevloped and kind of pointless. And the robot fights can get a little loud and screaming chaotic. They can be a little simliar and mindless at times too but they work just well enough. And yet despite all that...I really liked it. It's a heartwarming type of film you would never expect it to be. This is something to defintely put on for the family, a sports movie, Sci-Fi, or fans of the direcotr or actors in it. Great suprise and defintely would watch again.",
