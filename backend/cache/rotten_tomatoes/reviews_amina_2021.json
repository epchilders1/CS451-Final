Awesome dialogues and characters.\nHowever, the plot was a bit confusing and certain holes would have been avoided.\nHowever,  a great movie.",

    "text": "An ambitious historical epic. Despite severe budgetary constraints, Amina has an air of authenticity, dignity, and such genuine gravitas that one can't help but wonder what resourceful non-Western filmmakers could do with the millions of studio dollars thrown at far, far less genuine fare like the Disney Wakanda films. In a sense, even if done with the best of intentions, it's cultural colonialism when Hollywood deigns to tell others' stories through a Western lens instead of, for example, giving technical and financial support for people to tell their own stories. Amina is an example of artistic vision being limited by practical means yet still succeeding on its own terms.",

    "text": "Might just be me, but this was unwatchable. The film appeared to be a parody of African culture. I could put up with the awefull English pronunciation, but not the utterly confusing plot. 20 minutes in and I was lost. The costumes looked like they came from a really bad costume party. Generally, an insult to African culture.",
