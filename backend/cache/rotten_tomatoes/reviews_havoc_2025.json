Not the greatest quality either. Not even the elite cast could save this movie & im a big Tom hardy fan. Can\u2019t recommend",

But as the story goes on it defies all logic, climbs down the shelf and disappear into the cinematic FMCG. There's enough power in visuals, audio and the performances of this star studded cast but the story becomes too predictable and preposterous to hang onto. However the action sequences would definitely keep any audience entertained.",

The incoherent writing was garbage, the camera-on-a-vibrator cinematography was garbage, the slapstick martial arts were garbage, the soulless acting was garbage and especially the directing was pure garbage.\n\n It would have some redeeming quality if it was intentionally funny, but I was definitely laughing at this movie and not with it.",

Almost turned it off after 5 minutes, because the action scene was terrible and the cameras were shaking too much.\nStayed with it but still hallway through I had enough... Not even Whitaker nor Hardy helped pushing to a decent level of movie. Too bad",

It's also a hyper-violent shoot 'em up that despite the excessive number bullets being shot most of the time nobody has any accuracy -- not even nearly point-blank with a shotgun. Decisions like that just take you out of the action.",
