    "text": "The Angry Birds Movie (2016) \u2013 Animated Comedy\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here\u2014this movie is very rough. It\u2019s not a polished, groundbreaking animated film by any means. But with that being said, it\u2019s still enjoyable enough for young children. They get the thrill of seeing their favorite Angry Birds video game characters brought to life in a theatrical feature, and in that regard, it delivers what they want.\n\nThe voice acting cast is perfectly fine. Everyone does a solid job with their delivery, and the director deserves credit for piecing the film together as best as possible. The issue comes down to the writing. The comedy is present, but it doesn\u2019t land the way it needs to. A lot of the dialogue feels lapse and slightly off, and overall the script gives off the vibe of being rushed rather than carefully developed. It feels undercooked when it easily could\u2019ve been more clever and appealing across all ages.\n\nThat\u2019s really where the problem lies\u2014this movie does not appeal to adults or even teenagers in any significant way. And that matters, because parents are the ones rewatching films like this alongside their kids over and over again. The best animated films succeed because they balance humor and storytelling for both children and adults, but The Angry Birds Movie leans entirely toward little kids, leaving adults bored and disengaged.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not unwatchable. It has enough energy and silliness to keep kids entertained, and it\u2019s definitely rewatchable if you have young children who want to see it again. But outside of that, it lacks substance, wit, and charm.\n\nI\u2019m not going to score this one high. However, I will give it a very slight thumbs up\u2014not because it\u2019s a great film, but because it serves its purpose for the younger generation. It\u2019s not completely rotten, but it\u2019s also far from soaring.",

I played the Angry Birds games when I was little, and I still play it to this day! But I do feel like the other birds were rude to Red, and the movie was kind gross, and it was a bit annoying the way Stella (the pink bird) was moving her arm. But it\u2019s still a good adaptation!",
