    "text": "Edgar Wright's stylistic playground delivers exactly what you'd expect: meticulously choreographed action synced to a killer soundtrack, wrapped in vibrant visuals.\n\nThe opening 45 minutes are genuinely electric... establishing Baby's world with such precision and energy that you're completely locked in. Then the middle act hits a frustrating lull. For about 30 minutes, the momentum stalls as the film spins its wheels without adding much substance. The romance feels underdeveloped, and the plotting meanders when it should accelerate.\n\nThankfully, Wright rescues things in the final stretch. The last half-hour delivers satisfying - if predictable - action and emotional payoffs. Jon Hamm's transformation into the primary threat is genuinely compelling, even if you see the beats coming.\n\nIt's a 7/10 for me: a technical showcase that's occasionally too enamored with its own style, losing narrative grip before recovering for a solid finish. Worth watching for the music alone, even if it doesn't fully sustain its brilliant opening promise.",

You will have seen the praise for its soundtrack, which is top tier, but the editing often goes without a mention. Truly brilliant. \n\nThis is a film that should be studied in film classes across the world in a few decades time, and it will be a crying shame if it doesn\u2019t influence a generation of film-makers.",

    "text": "Exciting ride, but lacking character. The getaway driver focus which traditionally adds thrill to the heist genre is accomplished just as well as any other movie that sets out to do the same. However, the film asks the audience to additionally consider the character depth of its eccentric, but skilled protagonist. The formula departure that sets \u201cBaby Driver\u201d apart. The thing is, what is to be found there in the character lacks complexity and is only skin deep. I would watch again with friends, but am not likely to put on the \u201cwatch often\u201d section of my collection.",

It seems to be naive and simplistic Hollywood romance of young lovers between too many with unrealistic and overdone to the point of boring, car chase sequences. Repeat. The ending with a gore-drenched  baddie who just refuses to die pursuing our 'hero' is simple ludicrous. A time waster on TV. Glad I didn't pay to see it.",
