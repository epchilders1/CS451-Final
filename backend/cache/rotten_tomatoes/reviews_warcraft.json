Film was pretty good would say 5/10 only because i never played warcraft and half these nerds who reviewed it prolly did, and all of them use an avatar thats slim and in skimpy clothes while really they are sweating in their mums basement. Give it a chance, battle los angeles is worse",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Warcraft\" (2016) is a one OK / nice movie to see it in a movie theater for those who didn't play the games and couldn't spell one of many bizarre names of characters in this movie (I'm one of those). Special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. The weakest part of this movie for me was Travis Fimmel acting. That has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. They need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. And sorry Paula Patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. The story was quite OK - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. As not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some OK flick on Friday evening, \"Warcraft\" is for you, but don't expect to be blown away. \n\nOverall, \"Warcraft\" is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. Performances were between low and OK - better cast highly recommended for sequels (although there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). \"Warcraft\" is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. So - it's a OK flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.",

    "text": "How did the mythica movie series truly get higher reviews this warcraft. This was a great movie. Everyone seems to be judging it off the video game. We cant be doing that. Warcraft had much better fight scenes and cgi then mythica yet it was reviewed very biased. What a shame on this so called professional critics. We need a second warcraft movie sooner then later. MUST WATCH IF YOU ARE INTO MYTHICAL FANTASY. Worth every minute",

But this is a good movie, solid script, great cinematography. Duncan Jones did a good job directing. Whole stellar cast excels convincingly in character. Lots of action, intrigue, twists and adventure thrown into this magical mystical story. Highly entertaining, time passes quickly with this one",
