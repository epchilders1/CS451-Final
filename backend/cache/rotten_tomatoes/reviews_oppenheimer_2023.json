No I didnt want them to use an atomic bomb but grab some cgi to make it sligthly more favorable, yes there is a battle between morality and clarity, so that was good I guess, Nolan is by far my favorite director, but honwstly this really could have been made into a documentary and been 80% as good.  There will be a lot of Nolan fan boys that like this just becasue they like all his other stuff, but this one bombed for sure.",

    "text": "An absolute gem of a movie by Christopher Nolan. Not a single dull moment in the entire movie. The protagonist acted fabulously to portray the complex character of Oppenheimer. \nLoved the ending of the movie which provokes deep introspection -- especially the scene between Einstein and Oppenheimer. \n\nEinstein quietly warns Oppenheimer that once the world has inflicted sufficient punishment, it will shower him with medals and proclaim forgiveness\u2014not for Oppenheimer\u2019s sake, but to soothe its own guilty conscience. \n\nThis exchange lays bare how Oppenheimer\u2019s towering achievement has morphed into a lifelong burden of regret, and the eventual honors will serve less as genuine recognition than as a public ritual of absolution for everyone else.\n\nThe story is also a sobering reminder that the intellectuals who create unimaginable powerful weapons or systems do not actually play a role in deciding how it should be used. \n\nThe moment crystallizes the crushing moral and existential load Oppenheimer now bears, having grasped too late the devastating fallout of what he unleashed. In the end, their brief conversation stands as a somber meditation on the scientist\u2019s responsibility and the terrifying, often catastrophic unintended consequences of technological advancement. Today we stand an another threshold  -- of AI disrupting our lives both in positive and negative ways. Only time will tell the unintended consequences of the AI Revolution that we are experiencing today!",

    "text": "With excellent performances, excellent cinematography, excellent score, and excellent effects, Oppenheimer is Nolan at the top of his technical game. Balancing out the spectacle, the film brings equally hard hitting character moments and ethical quandaries which will stick with you long after the credits roll. Although perhaps slightly longer than necessary, with occasional moments of drag, it hardly registers next to the incredible talent on display in every facet of this film.",

I\u2019ll recommend this movie to people who like war movies.",

However, there were SOOOO many scenes with characters that talk FOREVER and it kind of bored me like crazy in some places. I'm probably biased because I'm not a history buff but if you are I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",

I can't help but be sucked into the enormity felt by the characters as they struggled with and ultimately coped with the creation of such a world changing weapon. It's crazy to think about how the impersonal nature of the weapon's power compares to the very real and very personal egos, agendas, and feelings of it's creators.",

    "text": "The best film of 2023! Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 5 out of 5 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!",
