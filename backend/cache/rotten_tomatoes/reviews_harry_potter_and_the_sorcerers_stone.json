    "text": "A charming introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter!\n\nChris Columbus\u2019 children\u2019s fantasy adventure film Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (2001) is a dreamy fantasy picture that will make you want to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I loved growing up with these movies as a child, now as an adult, I appreciate their delightful filmmaking and storytelling all the more. Richard Francis-Bruce edits this movie with such a natural pace that time flies by with a new quaint scenario of magic every scene. Columbus set a new standard for family entertainment by creating all this cinematic iconography with his greatest film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. It is pure joy for 152 magical minutes of childhood nostalgia.\n\nJ. K. Rowling\u2019s writing is like stepping into the magical fantasy world of wizards and witches that we all dreamed of casting spells and going to far away places. She understands the perspective of children desiring more from life, whether she writes about family, friends, love, adventure, travel, or courage in the face of adversity. Rowling invented an entire magical universe all her own that I\u2019m forever grateful for her mind. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is a delightful family movie that remains a personal favorite of mine to this day.\n\nHarry Potter famously found the most talented child actors around with natural performances, nice chemistry, and genuinely heartfelt emotions. Daniel Radcliffe is incredibly sympathetic and likable as the eager, yet shy Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is hilarious as the endearing poor fool Ron Weasley. Emma Watson was born to play Hermione Granger with her quick wits and adorable charm. She plays Hermione more smug initially until she warms up to the boys and their adventurous spirit. Tom Felton is perfectly cast as the villainous bully Draco Malfoy. His name even means bad guy, so you know Felton had this in the bag with his smug face and elitist attitude as Draco. He lets you know Malfoy is wealthy and comes from a long line of money and isn\u2019t afraid to cheat his way to the top. He\u2019s a phenomenally hateable antagonist and memorable character.\n\nRichard Harris is so kind and gentle as the formidable wizard headmaster Albus Dumbledore in all his flowing robes and magnificent beard. He sounds so soothing and knowledgeable that I think Harris\u2019 serene and kindly Dumbledore is my favorite incarnation of J. K. Rowling\u2019s iconic wizard character. Maggie Smith is gleefully stern as the brilliant witch Minerva McGonagall. Harry Potter is simply her best acting. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and sweet as the lovable giant Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman is phenomenal as Severus Snape with his wicked wit and morbidly serious tone. Rickman is so fun as Professor Snape because of the look of disdain he puts on so well. Richard Griffiths is very fun as Harry Potter\u2019s mean uncle Vernon Dursley alongside Fiona Shaw\u2019s wicked Aunt Petunia Dursley. Ian Hart is interesting as the timid and stuttering Professor Quirrell.\n\nI must mention the legendary actor Sir John Hurt cameos as the nice wand merchant Garrick Ollivander in the most mystifying scene in Harry Potter when Harry chooses his wand. Hurt captures an air of mystery and warmth that you will believe in magic!\n\nOther excellent supporting roles of note are David Bradley as the sadistic groundskeeper Mr. Filch with his cute cat Mrs. Norris. Matthew Lewis as the cowardly Neville Longbottom. Warwick Davis as the bank teller goblin and Filius Flitwick. Verne Troyer as Griphook is scary and neat. Harry Melling is such a jerk as Dudley Dursley. John Cleese is funny as Nearly Headless Nick like Julie Walters is kind as Ron\u2019s mother Molly Weasley. You can even see a cute young Bonnie Wright as Ron\u2019s little sister Ginny Weasley at the train station!\n\nChris Columbus\u2019 charming direction is what makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone so charming. You want to visit these magical places in an enchanted English countryside as it all looks real. The production design is mysterious, dusty, warm, and quaintly inviting. The practical effects are mixed carefully with excellent for the era CGI, where a talking snake looks real as does many magic spells. The only green screen that\u2019s noticeable is the backgrounds while students fly on brooms and the troll. Even the sorting hat still looks cool.\n\nJudianna Makovsky and Graham Churchyard\u2019s costumes are already iconic from Dumbledore\u2019s robes, Snape\u2019s suit and cloak, to the Gryffindor scarves. Clare Le Vesconte\u2019s make-up is inspired with crazy choices for goblins and wizards alike. John Williams\u2019 score is so pleasant that you can never forget his theme songs for Harry Potter. He carefully composed each piece for each scene as the notes are cues for particular moments on screen for magical emphasis. He outdid himself with one of his most beloved and memorable scores within his illustrious career as a composer.\n\nColumbus brings his usual Christmas spirit and child\u2019s playful attitude alongside his resplendent directorial choices. The scary sequences are dark and mysterious, while various payoffs are cleverly established earlier up with clever framing and sequencing on his part. His swift and imaginative direction transcends time and age as he crafted a wonderful feature for all ages. John Seale\u2019s striking cinematography captures wide shots of Hogwarts castle, dark foggy forests, hidden chambers, and brightly lit halls with equal grace. Seale\u2019s close-ups are iconic and very expressive.\n\nIn conclusion, Chris Columbus directed a classic film with Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone with his creative direction, Williams\u2019 legendary score, and a cool cast of talented kids.",

    "text": "Magically unsurpassable. The beginning of the greatest fantasy and science fiction franchise in cinema.\n\nThe beginning of one of the greatest and most influential modern fantasy sagas could not have had a stronger start. 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus, not only masterfully introduces the vast magical universe created by J.K. Rowling, but also sets a cinematic standard that would define an entire generation.\n\nThe greatest strength of the film undoubtedly lies in its main cast. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson portray the central trio with naturalness and charisma, creating one of the most memorable and endearing dynamics in contemporary cinema. It is almost impossible to imagine other actors in their roles: their chemistry is immediate, genuine, and, above all, unforgettable.\n\nNarratively, the film successfully balances adventure, mystery, and tenderness, keeping the viewer engaged from start to finish. Despite its considerable runtime, every scene serves a purpose within the story, leaving no room for boredom. The magic is brought to life through visual effects that, although showing their age today, remain believable and enchanting, demonstrating the technical and artistic quality of the production.\n\nJohn Williams\u2019 score deserves special mention: few compositions have reached such a level of recognition and lasting impact. Its main theme not only defines the essence of the film but also the entire imagination of the saga.\n\nThe settings, from the halls of Hogwarts to the most secluded corners of the magical world, have an atmosphere so real and detailed that they evoke the desire to become part of that universe.\n\nIn short, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone' is a modern classic: a gateway to a fascinating universe, crafted with love, talent, and a cinematic vision that still holds all its enchanting power today.",

Both Rowling and Tolkien overwrite, making the novels tedious in the extreme to read, but the films are highly entertaining. Of the principals both Radcliffe and Watson develop as actors over the course of the series however the appalling Grint gets even worse, his 'acting' limited to pulling annoying faces and whimpering.",

    "text": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone will always hold a special place in my heart \u2014 it was my very first VHS tape and the only film I was ever allowed to watch alone in my room. Pure childhood magic. The nostalgia hits hard every time that John Williams score kicks in \u2014 pure world-building perfection. The cast is ridiculously stacked (honestly, Britain\u2019s entire acting scene must\u2019ve been on set), and considering they were wrangling actual kids, the performances hold up impressively well. It\u2019s a warm, mysterious, and cozy introduction to a world that would grow into something iconic. Sure, it\u2019s heavy on exposition, and yeah, the book is better \u2014 RIP Peeves, gone but not forgotten \u2014 but as a cinematic gateway, it nails the charm. As a proud Slytherin, I\u2019ll say it: this film didn\u2019t just start a saga; it helped shape who I am. Classic.",

    "text": "A whimsical start to a series that would soon become a dark shadow of itself. The main cast and sets bring such a warm cozy feeling, with a huge part of that coming down to the excellent direction from Chris Columbus. Choosing to cast actual children without much screen experience for the main cast can lead the occasional bad delivery, but its possibly the best decision this film made, to really cement Harry, Ron, and Hermione as these people on screen. Excellent start 8/10",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nA magical start to a beloved franchise, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone enchants audiences with its faithful adaptation of J.K. Rowling\u2019s world, charming performances, and dazzling visuals. While the film occasionally leans into exposition, its heart, humor, and sense of wonder more than make up for it. \n\n\nReview:\nFrom the moment Harry first steps into Diagon Alley, the film immerses viewers in a spellbinding universe that feels both grand and intimate. Daniel Radcliffe brings a sincere curiosity and vulnerability to the role of the Boy Who Lived, supported by an impeccable cast including Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who capture the magic of friendship effortlessly. The cinematography, set design, and John Williams\u2019 iconic score transport audiences to Hogwarts like never before, making each corridor and classroom feel alive with possibility. Minor pacing issues in the middle don\u2019t detract from the overall experience\u2014a film that\u2019s as enchanting for newcomers as it is for lifelong fans. A near-perfect beginning to a legendary cinematic journey.",

The movie itself had some seriously campy moments, and the acting needed a bit of improvement, but what would you expect in a first of many movies when you hire a group of children to lead a movie franchise. \n\nI found the movie to be endearing overall. It also hit me, it\u2019s funny to watch this movie as an adult and take the children\u2019s ideas about what is happening in the adult world around them at face value. I also thought that the blatant nepotism some teachers have towards Harry would rub me the wrong way as a teacher \u2013 perhaps I\u2019m more like Snape than I would have originally liked to believe.",
