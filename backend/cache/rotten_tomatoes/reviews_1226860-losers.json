Everything about it was perfect, the casting, the directing, the script, etc. Great action, funny AF, hot Zoe Saldana scenes, just about all you'd want from an action thriller. One of the most underrated movies of all time (tied with Cop Out).",

    "text": "I struggle to find positives other than the casting in this chaotic, mindless action flick which struggles to really take a stand on where it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it an action flick? Even the film can't decide most of the time. \n\nThe first act blasts us into believing this is a great film. A mysterious untraceable villian and a gang of special forces who all have their own unique skill set. Excellent. A mysterious woman wanting to aid the group to extract revenge. Excellent. Then it nose dives off a cliff when the villian is revealed and who is supposed to be an unhinged psychopath but the reality is you cannot take him seriously at all. The acting is terrible. It's like a kid got a hold of his dad's suit and played pretend dress up saying mean things to sound cool. The villian just tries so hard to portray a sinister unhinged madman that it goes too far in the opposite direction to be laughable and cringe worthy. \n\nBy the time the finale takes place you are left with a lot more questions than answers. Like how did the woman find them? Where did the villian go? Why was there a need for that plot twist and how did it ever happen? What happened to the villians hand? Why do I care? What have I just watched? Clearly filmed with the intention of a franchise, the film ends offering you more but it delivered nothing in the first place for you to want more. Flopping at the box office this was always destined for a bargain bucket and any hope of a sequel is long long gone, much like your interest when you get to the end of this film.",

    "text": "Ever watched a movie that has a lot of elements of a good movie, but somehow isn't a good movie?  And you can't quite put your finger on why?  This is one of those.\n\n\nHas some pretty good actors, some good action scenes, and even some good funny bits, but it just doesn't come together in a cohesive movie.\n\n\nIt's possible the plot, which is pretty simple, even for an action movie.  The antagonist is pretty unconvincing as well.  I'm also beginning to think that Jeffery Dean Morgan just isn't a good movie protagonist.  His acting here just felt like his character in the Watchmen.  Arsehole American, that is somehow a good guy.  It just doesn't work.\n\n\nSkinny, American accent, Idris was also a bit off putting.  And Oscar Jeanada's character was clich\u00e9 to the point of being almost tokenism and insulting.  The director and writers need a slap up side of head for that.\n\n\nChris Evans, however, was a stand out in this.\n\n\nAt the end of the day it felt like a setup for a DC franchise that just didn't clear enough hurdles to get another movie.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Los perdedores es una de esas pel\u00edculas de acci\u00f3n que no se complican la vida. Sabe lo que es y lo aprovecha al m\u00e1ximo: un entretenimiento ligero con explosiones, tiroteos y un grupo de personajes carism\u00e1ticos que parecen sacados directamente de las vi\u00f1etas. Y es que, al fin y al cabo, su origen est\u00e1 en un c\u00f3mic de DC. Se nota en su estilo visual y en el tono exagerado de muchas escenas, que juegan con la espectacularidad sin tomarse demasiado en serio.\n\nEl reparto, visto hoy, es un aut\u00e9ntico lujo. En 2010, Chris Evans, Zoe Salda\u00f1a e Idris Elba a\u00fan no eran estrellas de primer nivel, pero ya ten\u00edan una presencia magn\u00e9tica en pantalla. Su qu\u00edmica es innegable y le da mucha vida a la pel\u00edcula, logrando que incluso los momentos m\u00e1s exagerados funcionen. La historia en s\u00ed no inventa nada nuevo: el t\u00edpico equipo traicionado que busca venganza, pero el ritmo din\u00e1mico y el humor hacen que todo fluya sin volverse pesada.\n\nNo todo funciona igual de bien. El abuso de la c\u00e1mara lenta y ciertas decisiones de montaje acaban volvi\u00e9ndose repetitivas, y el villano, en lugar de imponer, se siente m\u00e1s como una caricatura exagerada que nunca representa una amenaza real. Aun as\u00ed, Los perdedores no pretende ser m\u00e1s de lo que es, y en ese sentido cumple. Si buscas una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n sin complicaciones, con escenas espectaculares y un grupo de protagonistas que se lo pasan bien, esta es una opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s que v\u00e1lida.\n\n(ENGLISH) The Losers is one of those action movies that doesn\u2019t overthink things. It knows exactly what it is and makes the most of it: a lighthearted, explosive ride filled with shootouts and a group of charismatic characters that seem straight out of the comic book pages. And that makes sense\u2014after all, it's based on a DC comic. You can see it in the visual style and the over-the-top tone of many scenes, which embrace spectacle without taking themselves too seriously.\n\nLooking back, the cast is now a powerhouse. In 2010, Chris Evans, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, and Idris Elba weren\u2019t yet the huge stars they are today, but they already had undeniable screen presence. Their chemistry is one of the movie\u2019s strongest assets, making even the most absurd moments work. The story doesn\u2019t break any new ground\u2014it\u2019s the classic setup of a betrayed team seeking revenge\u2014but the fast pace and humor keep it from dragging.\n\nNot everything works perfectly. The excessive use of slow-motion and some editing choices become repetitive, and the villain, instead of being truly menacing, feels more like an over-the-top caricature that never poses a real threat. Still, The Losers doesn\u2019t try to be more than it is, and in that regard, it delivers. If you\u2019re looking for an uncomplicated action flick with spectacular set pieces and a cast that\u2019s clearly having fun, this one is a solid choice.",

    "text": "While it isn't the worst film I've ever seen, it's a wonder why I believe it's possibly one of the most boring films I've ever seen. With a stacked cast of actors I absolutely adore with the likes of Chris Evans, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba, and Zo\u00eb Saldana, and very good acting all across the board, it is honestly shocking how indifferent I feel to this movie. It feels tacky and a little too campy, and forced scenes all around with characters doing off-the-wall actions that I found myself asking \u201cWhy?\u201d to. The only thing I truly liked was the fight against Jason Patric\u2019s men and the traitor *SPOILER ALERT* who turned out to be Idris Elba. Which made for a beautiful fight between Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Idris Elba as they give their all to try and kill each other once and for all, but make the fatal mistake of cowardice which seals one of their fates. With great humor and admittedly amazing beginning and ending sequences, it is still enjoyable, but with a middle that seems so empty and void of real substance, it just gets pegged down a notch.",

Then we have \"The Losers\", ironically being the least at the shared average's standardized minimum, is down as your ordinary action flick multiplied by the number of teammates dealing with the narratively problematic treatment with portions tackled better in other pictures. An excellent cast wittedly equipped provides the fun definition behind their own unique action pieces that were cleverly built, just not enough boost to prove itself above average but worth the view when only asking for simple fun rather than be like the others' performative assets.

    "text": "Classic Super-Hero movie without capes\n\nIf you like plot-work reminiscent of the classic superhero comics, and want to see an action movie that packs the punch and keeps the pace at a high level while never letting down with dialogue, then this is the movie I recommend. It is about a fringe group of soldiers for the United States who end up AWOL, and in some ways may remind you of GI Joe. However, there is no Predator in these jungles, and instead, the action-adventure that ensues is priceless. This is one of my favorite action movies of all time. There are no capes, there aren't a bunch of guys running around in tights, there's no Secret Service budget or 007 dramatics, there's just normal guys with machine guns. The main character is also from Watchmen, the Comedian, and is a solid action actor, and good choice for lead, with supporting actors including Idris Elba and Chris Evans, the selection of actors is fun. It's a gang of guys and one lady outfitted with different specs, who work together like a Charles Bronson Death Wish Voltron. It works.",
