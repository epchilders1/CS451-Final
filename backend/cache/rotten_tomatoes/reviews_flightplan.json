Only for it to be in fact a nonsensical conspiracy hijacking thing. Also no one involved in this film has ever been on a plane before because the aircraft is insanely large and filled with nothing.",

Jodie Foster did an awesome job. The plot was interesting. A good thriller. Didn't expect the ending the go like it did. Was on suspense the whole time. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Just rewatched Flightplan and honestly, it still holds up as one of those tense, contained thrillers that keeps you second-guessing yourself the whole way through. Jodie Foster is, as always, spot on, she really nails that frantic energy of a parent who just knows something is wrong, even when everyone else starts treating her like she's out of her mind. The direction does a great job ramping up the tension and never letting it drop, and the whole production feels tight, with that clean, minimal vibe you get from modern plane interiors.\n\nWhat really hit me this time, though, is how weirdly detached the rest of the passengers were. Like, a kid goes missing mid-flight and half the people on that plane act like someone lost an iPad or their headphones. There's this disturbing sense of apathy that just makes the whole situation feel more claustrophobic. The script plays with that a lot, building this wall between Foster\u2019s character and everyone else, which amps up the paranoia. The cinematography and score both lean into the unease, with close, almost suffocating shots that keep you inside her head the whole time.\n\nAll in all, Flightplan still delivers, a solid, anxiety-fueled ride that reminds you how scary it is when no one takes your side. Plus, bonus points for how relatable it is when people are more bothered by delays than the actual crisis at hand.",
