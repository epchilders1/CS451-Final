The story line was weird and uncomfortable. Stan was disgusting. An absolute selfish jerk, void of genuine feelings. His character showed too many red flags of a narcissistic abuser and Zoe was too desperate to notice. The sequel might look something like the movie \u201cEnough\u201d unfortunately. Disturbing. Two thumbs down.",

    "text": "The first thing I will say about this movie is that it's not terrible. The story is interesting, the characters are good led by the always charming Jennifer Lopez. But, the guy she is with and wants and so forth is an ASSHOLE. This guy gets pissed off at her in almost every single scene, talking to her like she's an idiot. And the whole time we are supposed to be rooting for this couple to get together? Nope. Not here. I was rooting for her to see how much of an ass this guy really was, but sadly no. And then the movie ends with a really weird, out of place scene where it's some time after her babies were born and then she throws up in a garbage can and the two stare at each other with wide open eyes. Were they seriously setting this up to have a sequel? I hope it was supposed to be a joke, because it's been 11 years and no Back-Up Plan 2! Either way, the movie is okay but there are some stupid, cliched moments like a \"giving birth hurts so if the woman is yelling in a deep baritone voice then it's fucking hilarious\" scene, \"guys always can't stand hearing about female anatomy and they pass out\" scene, \"having kids is really, really hard so let's make sure the guy sees nothing but the bad side of having children\" scene, or in this case scenes. I give it a low rating for all the things mentioned, but if you remove the guy and replace him with a different actor then this movie might have been really good.",
