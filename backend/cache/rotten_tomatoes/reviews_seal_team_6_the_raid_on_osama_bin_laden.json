    "text": "This movie is ostensibly a reenactment of how Seal Team Six performed the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. Yet the movie begins by slamming Republican politicians, and then it shows American soldiers acting like Keystone Kops and getting themselves hurt and killed. Some unseen interviewer allegedly talks to people involved, but they give mumbling answers. The movie broke down in the middle of viewing, but I already gave up in disgust. The only person being honored is our great leader Barack Obama. Kim il-Sung would laugh at this travesty.",

And this set up is introduced as a city in Pakistan. \nPoor observations and low skilled editing. \nThe starting 10 minutes were a tell-tell sign about the full movie.",

But, at some point of the movie it would get a little slow and confusing.   Also they could have showed more of the CIA investigating and how they got all their information and then maybe a little more showing them actually going in and getting Osama.",

    "text": "SEAL Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden is really quite a bit better than its lower budget made-for-television and, it might seem, made-for-controversy and made-for-political-gain aspects all suggest. There's a lot to like in its straightforward, no-frills approach; politics aside, it paints an intriguing picture, no matter how accurately, inaccurately, or somewhere in between the story captures history. It's not a guns-blazing picture but rather a thoughtful character study of the men and women, technologies, risks, and rewards of making one of the 21st century's (so far) most historical moments happen. It's well-acted and well-made, a movie that should please all viewers who appreciate a good story inside the military and political arenas. It does get its own political two cents thrown in, but outside of a few such moments, this is solid entertainment for the mind as well as the eyes and ears.",

Alright film, but kind of a let down considering the subject matter.",

It may not have anywhere near the budget that Zero Dark Thirty had but I felt that they tried too hard to add drama by exploring one of the Seals private life which didn't really lead to anything in substance. Any added drama seemed untrue and irrelevant. Some good performances from Cam Gigandet and the American Pie guy.",
