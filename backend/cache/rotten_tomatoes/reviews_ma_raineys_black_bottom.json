    "text": "A filmed play. Since most of my own films are adaptations of my own plays, \"filmed play\" isn't always an insult. But \"Ma Rainey\" was kind of talky and a little tedious. I did enjoy Mr. Boseman's performance, but I knew almost from the start that he was going to die during the film. The character who wants to stretch beyond his expected place in these sorts of stories always gets stopped somehow (kind of predictable). Nicely acted, and good music.",

Has all the hallmarks of a stage play rather than a film and that\u2019s ultimately why it is good but not great. Watched on Netflix.",

The scope of this movie is so extensive that it doesn't quite fit into the limited setting of a single recording session. Even so, it keenly explores racism and how African-Americans simultaneously revolutionized and were marginalized by the music industry of the early Twentieth Century.",

    "text": "George C. Wolfe brings one fateful afternoon to the screen in this Oscar-winning drama. Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning play, 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' tells the story of a humid afternoon in 1920s Chicago. The film marks Chadwick Boseman's final on-screen performance before his death in August 2020. 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' features sensational performances from its entire cast that consists of the likes of Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman and Glynn Turman.\n\nWhen the backing singers for the esteemed blues singer Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) arrive at a Chicago recording studio, they share stories and ideas as they wait for her to arrive. When Ma Rainey finally arrives, tensions rise as equipment failures, harrowing stories and conceited trumpeters disrupt their recording. But when the recording ends, what happens next will change the course of everyone's lives forever.\n\nViola Davis gives a sensational performance in the titular role, portraying the so-called 'mother of the blues'. Her Oscar nomination for leading actress takes her total amount of Academy Award nominations to a record-breaking four. Chadwick Boseman stars opposite Davis as the hubristic trumpet player Levee Green. Boseman's performance is emotionally raw and full of overconfidence. Colman Domingo, Glynn Turman and Michael Potts all give great performances throughout the 94 minutes.\n\nThe costumes in the film are gorgeous and incredibly detailed, so it's no surprise Ann Roth received an array of accolades for her part in making the film. The hair and makeup department do a sensational job with every character's look; the attention to detail is remarkable. When it comes to Viola Davis' wig, Ann Roth and Mia Neal, for accuracy and authenticity, decided to hand-make Ma Rainey's wig from horsehair.\n\nEven though the characters looked incredible, 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' can't help but drag itself to its closing credits. The fact it was all predominantly contained in two rooms didn't help either. Not even the magnificent talent heading the film can save it from becoming a mundane near-waste of time. Considering the film is about the mother of blues and her band, viewers will be surprised to learn that 90% of the film is just rage-fuelled monologues or over the top reactions - there's hardly any singing.\n\nHowever, the film does bring up issues that relate to when the film is set. Themes like racism and the LGBTQ+ community as Taylour Paige plays Ma Rainey's younger lover Dussie Mae. It shows how Ma Rainey and other BIPOC were used simply because of their talent and the profit they could provide people. At the end of the film, it's addressed when Levee's original song is sung and recorded by a group of white men instead of Levee himself.\n\nIf you want to learn more about women who don't give in to a racist, sexist patriarchy, then you should be watching 'Selena'. But if you're enamoured by Viola Davis' talent, then you should watch 'Fences' or 'The Help. Both of these films allow Davis to show off her never-ending talents. 'Fences' also stars producer Denzel Washington opposite Davis.\n\nIn conclusion, George C. Wolfe's adaptation of the August Wilson play is a mixed bag. While the performances and appearances may be spectacular, the story can't help but feel stodgy and slow.",

    "text": "An example of how a real little masterpiece can be shot with a modest budget is this year's Oscar nominee George Wolf's movie with Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman. Everything is there, from the choice of an always current topic, through masterful directing, to extraordinary acting.\n\nUnfortunately, the film is at least about Ma Rainey's music, as the title might interpret. But who cares about music, can watch \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\" from February this year, which, on the other hand, has nothing else to offer but an interesting interpretation of songs and decent acting by Andra Day. Lady Day as the \"leader of the civil movement\"? No, thanks.\n\n\"Ma Rainey's...\" is a brilliant film that will be remembered primarily by the bitter story, which you have to see instead of being told, but also by the extraordinary acting of Viola Davis, as well as the fact that this is the last role of Chadwick Boseman, who, unlike the role in the greatly overestimated \"Black Panther\" from 2018, shows all his lavish acting talent here.\n\nAn interesting note is that in the original play, Levee never breaks down the closed door in the rehearsal space.",
