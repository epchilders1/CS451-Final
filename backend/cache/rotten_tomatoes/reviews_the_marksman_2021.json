    "text": "The marksman starring Liam Neeson is a great movie about a guy who lost his wife to cancer and just mind his own business on his property near the border of Mexico and ends up helping out a woman and her child trying to escape the cartel. Things turned badly and the mother was shot and the story is Liam neeson\u2019s character trying to get this young man to relatives before the cartel gets to both of them and kills them. I thought this show was really good Liam Neeson does a terrific job in his role as as does the young man who plays the little boy. I don\u2019t recommend this film for children under 14 and there is a lot of violence in this one and the killing of an animal which I hate to see that in a movie.",

Not everything has to be some deep artistic expression. Look at the juxtaposition between the people that watched the movie and the people that \"critiqued\" the movie. Can you get more out of touch?",

    "text": "The Marksman is one of those films that delivers exactly what you\u2019d expect from a Liam Neeson project, offering familiar beats and the same rugged persona he\u2019s become known for. While this movie does attempt to add a bit more storytelling than some of his other recent work, it still falls into that predictable pattern that makes many of his films feel copy-and-paste. It wavers between being slightly more thoughtful and fully embracing the formula he\u2019s repeated for years.\n\nLiam Neeson is undeniably a talented actor, and his presence alone can elevate a storyline. But the issue here is saturation\u2014how many times can we watch him play nearly the same character in a slightly different setting? One film takes place on a train, another on a plane, another in a truck or on foot, and this time he\u2019s escorting a young Hispanic boy on the run. The repetition becomes impossible to ignore, and instead of variety, it feels like another rearranged version of the same story.\n\nThe direction in The Marksman doesn\u2019t do much to break away from the usual Neeson mold. The filmmaker sticks so closely to the established formula that the movie begins to feel like a checklist of Liam Neeson tropes. Somber man with a dark past? Check. Reluctant guardian role? Check. Intense chase sequences sprinkled throughout? Check. Nothing about the approach feels fresh or bold, which ultimately leaves the movie lacking impact.\n\nThe screenplay appears almost tailor-made for Neeson, relying heavily on his persona rather than crafting a character with depth beyond the actor playing him. Instead of building an emotional or complex narrative, the writing centers everything around his presence and his usual style. That leaves the supporting characters underdeveloped, the dialogue predictable, and the emotional beats less effective than they could have been with a more robust script.\n\nThat said, The Marksman isn\u2019t entirely without merit. There are moments of tension, a few engaging scenes, and enough heart to keep some viewers invested. For those who enjoy Neeson\u2019s particular brand of action-drama, this film will likely feel familiar in a comforting way. It\u2019s not poorly made\u2014it just doesn\u2019t offer anything new or exciting to distinguish itself from his other entries in the genre.\n\nUltimately, The Marksman is watchable but not memorable. It sits comfortably in the middle of Liam Neeson\u2019s long list of similar movies, offering a serviceable but unremarkable experience. While it\u2019s far from the worst film in his filmography, it\u2019s certainly not one I\u2019d revisit. It\u2019s a decent one-time watch, but it\u2019s definitely not my cup of tea.",

    "text": "Can\u2019t say no to an action-packed thriller with the Great Liam! I enjoyed this movie. It was a good length where it didn\u2019t drag on and it kept you on your toes watching what the next move will be. Liam stumbles upon a little boy running from the Mexican cartel and takes him under his wing. Liam takes out the bad guys in a satisfying way and he does it with precision. I would give this movie a 8.8/10.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\n\nIt does not get a 10 because the mother\u2019s death could have been prevented, unrealism, and a bit of a cliffhanger. Why didn\u2019t she tell Liam the cartel was on the way? How did the SUV flip from a sniper shot? Why did Liam take a huge risk by giving the main bad guy a loaded gun at the end? What happened to Liam after he got on the bus?",
