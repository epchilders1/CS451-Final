    "text": "Tried so hard to feel like an early 2000s style movie with the plot of unpopular kids trying to be popular at a party and win the love interest. Keep the nostalgia in 2000 and think of new ideas. Plus the actions of the \"kids\" in this movie was either flat out illegal or trying too hard. I get it's a movie but it doesn't have to be like this. The only new thing this movie thinks up is the criminal activity. Which really brings out the fact it's a terrible movies. Only Olson, Cannavale, and MacArthur was the best part of the movie. Would never recommend.",

Bobby Cannavale as the science teacher is hilarious too \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. \nThe stuff these kids get up to sort of reminds me of my teen years back in the 90's- except for the vaping and hard drugs. Kids should not touch that shit!\nOverall it is an entertaining romp.",

Everything else not as much. It kinda tries to be like any high-school movies or grownups. \n\nThe ending could've been better tbh. But I enjoyed the jokes and laughs.",
