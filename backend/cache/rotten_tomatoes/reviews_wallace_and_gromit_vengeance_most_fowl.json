The shorter films somehow seem just a bit more special and leaves you wanting more.  However, quodos to the man voicing Wallace, he really does bring back life the wonderful Peter Sallis.",

WOW am I glad I was wrong, they knocked it out of the park with this, and it's definitely the most cinematic Wallace and gromit project, and the emotion definitely hit home, definitely way better than I expected",

Like in that short film, in this one, we have a main antagonist that is truly iconic. Wallace invents an AI gnome that is basically going to ruin their world as they know it, and only Gromit see it as a problem.",

I saw it on its premiere on BBC One, on Christmas Day 2024.\nThe story is brilliant, Ben Whitehead is great as Wallace, Peter Kay returns as PC Macintosh and is hilarious as always, and Feathers McGraw returns which makes it even more interesting.",

Full of quick witted humor that flows so well. The story is awesome with exciting plot points, unpredictable moments, & touching emotion. I wish the tone is more consistent with satire but it ultimately breaks into its own thing which is a great success.",

    "text": "\"I can live without inventing, but I can't live without... me best pal!\"\n\nA delightful comeback.\n\nWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl was an absolute joy to watch from beginning to end. I loved seeing these two characters back in action after so many years, bringing back wonderful memories of their earlier adventures. The use of stop-motion remains visually stunning, full of charm and meticulous detail, reminding us why this technique is still so special. The film is thoroughly entertaining, with genuinely funny moments, but also offers a powerful reflection on current issues that adds depth to the story. A perfect mix of humor, nostalgia, and thoughtful commentary, and I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Wallace and Gromit The Curse of The Were Rabbit was one of my favorite films of all time, and I thought Nick Park would never be able to outdo himself. \nYet he did.\nComing 19 years later, as a sequel to his short film The Wrong Trousers, Vengeance Most Fowl is definitely one of my favorite animated films since...who knows when.\nWallace and Gromit are the dynamic duo that really make these films stick together. But over here, their relationship is being threatened, due to technology. Soon all of Wallace's inventions have to be taken away, making the inventor very sad, and he has even forgotten how to open teapots.\nYes, they came up with yet another great plot with lots of heart and humor for Wallace and Gromit, and I am all for it. The music, stop motion animation (besides the great CGI water effects), and characters made this film one of my top ten movies I've ever seen. I liked that there were both a silent protagonist and silent antagonist. The best of both worlds!\nAfter a disastrous attempt at a Chicken Run sequel a year before (may it never be mentioned again), Aardman is back, better than ever before!\nAnd the Norbot song was very funny, by the way.",
