    "text": "You dare play that Miley Cyrus song in my presence?! I expected better, Dog Man! I found it annoying when it was still new and its overexposure back in 2023 made me hate it even more. But I'm getting off-topic before I've even gone on-topic. This sorta-spin-off of the Captain Underpants movie is pretty fun. Vibrant animation that does a good job translating Dav Pilkey's art style to 3D (though I think it was executed better in that First Epic Movie; for whatever reason, the Spider-Verse approach towards framerates didn't really do it for me here), quite a good chunk of visual gags and some surprisingly good character arcs. Let's be honest, Pete Davidson and his clone son are the real stars of the show here. Dog Man himself is a likeable character but it's Petey who's getting the lion's share of character development. One moment near the ending is particularly powerful and can come off as providing reassurance to any insecure parents, fathers especially. It seems DreamWorks really had their minds focused on parenthood seeing how this film came out barely a few months after The Wild Robot. Of course, Dog Man doesn't reach the same heights as that film but I don't think it's trying to be, and not simply because this was made by a different team who might not have been aware of what Chris Sanders and his crew were cooking up. This isn't going to set the world on fire but Dav Pilkey fans are still likely to enjoy what is essentially another instance of \"books in movie form\" whilst those unfamiliar still get an entertaining action-comedy that's not afraid to embrace silliness, and is probably all the better for it.",

The films not afraid of it's stupid humour allowing it to thrive but also managing to keep serious unique themes in there to interest kids and adults alike. Essentially shows a child of divorce dealing with co parenting. Incredibly sweet and humorous film",

The story of the movie was entertaining and humorous. It's about a cop who is half man half dog taking down a bad cat. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a great movie for an entire family.",

At its face this movie is a comedy, but I like that this movie does get more into the tragedy of Dog Man and it doesn't sugarcoat Petey's backstory. It would be 5 stars but I do have a few nitpicks, mainly I feel like flippy was just kind of shoved in at the end to finish off Dog Man and Petey's arcs, but overall a very good and super fun movie",

And this is a very poor way and terrible way to remake dog man, because it is one of my favorite book series. While I was in elementary",
