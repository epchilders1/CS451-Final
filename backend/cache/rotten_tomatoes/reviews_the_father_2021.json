    "text": "Very well acted movie that I will probably never watch again. Because it's so upsetting to watch. It reminds me of this woman who lived at an apartment complex where my father was a maintenance man. He sort of was friends with her and had helped her do some things over the period of a few years. But I remember being asked wants to help move her stuff because she had fallen down or something I don't know what exactly. So I go help move some of her stuff and then we take her to this place that I can only describe is like a place you go die. This poor woman goes from her home to a white cinder block room with a curtain separating her from a roommate on the tiniest bed you can imagine and we left her there and I will never f****** forget how heartbreaking that was and I barely knew her.",

Anthony Perkins is stunning in this, portraying a not so likeable character in the most human endearing way possible. So impressed with how the film plays around with the sets and cast to portray someone who's mind is slipping.",

    "text": "\"The Father\" extremely well made & tragic drama facing one's mental decline while suffering from the disease dementia.\nDirector, Florian Zeller throws you in the shoes of Anthony, as his confusion of memories are tough to break away from. Occasionally using actors to swap roles, the repeating of dialogue & the use of different locations keeping a familiar look in design to keep you trapped in Anthony's confusion of reality around him, it adds a certain emotional uncomfortableness to the storytelling.\nAnthony Hopkins & Olivia Colman both give great heartfelt performances that deserve the praise, especially Hopkins as his performance left me emotionally beaten.",
