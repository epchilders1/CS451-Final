However the movie is still enjoyable",

    "text": "I've been a long-time fan of Denzel Washington and have enjoyed most of his films. The Equalizer (2014) was a great start \u2014 dark, balanced, and deeply satisfying. The sequel, however, felt weaker in my opinion.\n\nEverything that made the first movie great is still here: Robert is badass, sarcastic, and intimidating \u2014 a cold, efficient killer. The action scenes showcase this perfectly, maybe even better than in the first movie.\n\nBut two things feel out of place. First, the kid he tries to save \u2014 it feels like the writers wanted to preserve the \u201csavior\u201d aspect from the first film, yet it doesn\u2019t really serve the story. That screen time could have been used to explore the conspiracy more deeply, which is the second weak point. We learn very little about it, and the final showdown in the village where Vivian comes from feels more like an excuse for cinematic scenery than a logical conclusion.\n\nThe Equalizer 2 delivers a decent story, decent action, and decent intensity \u2014 but it never comes close to the impact of the first film.",

The action isn't bad throughout most of the movie, but the ending felt a little overdone and unnecessary. If they took out the absurdity of the ending, I probably would have given it an extra half a star. The acting is well done, but it could've used some rewrites to deliver a much more solid film.",

    "text": "\u201cThis time, it\u2019s personal\u2026 again.\u201d\n\nYou know a movie\u2019s in trouble when you can predict who\u2019s going to die based on how sincere their first conversation is. The woman McCall chats with on the train? She might as well have worn a shirt that said Dead by Act Two. The filmmakers probably thought they were being clever. Sorry\u2014I\u2019ve seen this dance before. She\u2019s doomed the moment she shows a flicker of warmth.\n\nEqualizer 2 isn\u2019t a thriller, it\u2019s a PowerPoint presentation of clich\u00e9s. People show up, say exactly what they need to say to be avenged later, then disappear until it\u2019s time for McCall to frown, grab a hammer, and deliver justice in slow motion.\n\nAnd the villains? One by one, like lemmings. They never team up, never flank, never say, \u201cHey, maybe don\u2019t fight the human Terminator alone in a hurricane.\u201d They just walk into their deaths like it\u2019s a union gig.\n\nThe \u201ctwist\u201d (if you want to call it that) involving McCall\u2019s old buddy turning out to be the bad guy isn\u2019t a twist so much as a contractual obligation. The moment he walks onscreen with that \u201ctoo calm, too clean, probably evil\u201d look, you can hear the plot thudding into place.\n\nAnd what\u2019s with the stormy final battle on an abandoned seaside town? It\u2019s like someone said, \u201cYou know what would really elevate this flat revenge tale? Wind machines and mood lighting!\u201d\n\nDenzel does what he can. He always does. But even he can\u2019t save a movie that feels like it was written by a committee with access to an AI trained solely on Liam Neeson films.\n\nBottom line: Equalizer 2 isn\u2019t suspenseful. It\u2019s a checklist. And I\u2019ve seen this checklist before.\n\nJust a reminder. Justice is blind. So is the script.",

    "text": "Overall, a solid action movie! The acting was mostly strong, with Denzel Washington delivering his signature tough-guy performance as an ex-hitman. However, a few scenes felt lacking in quality\u2014particularly those involving Miles. For example, when operatives held him at gunpoint in McCall's apartment, his reaction seemed underwhelming. I expected more fear or intensity given the life-threatening situation. Despite these moments, the film was engaging and worth watching for action fans.",

    "text": "The original Equalizer film with Denzel was definitely a stunner. I feel like this one was a bit of a step down, but not that far down from the original. Plus what makes it not feel like a sequel is the fact that his hair is grown in, in this film. Unless I\u2019m missing something, it just feels like a continuity error throughout the whole movie and that\u2019s one of the smaller reasons I gave this film one star less. Either way? Denzel Washington carried this film and I still loved it. Especially the hurricane sequence.",

    "text": "A decent sequel that may slow down in action and excitement for a good middle chunk of the movie, but builds on grounded characterization and an insider deeper look into his world despite the thin direction of the plot. Denzel Washington is great as always while Pedro Pascal serves as a refreshingly different antagonist that sets him apart from the villains of the first movie. The mentorship between Denzel and the young teen was cute, even if it's final conversation after that crazy climax felt a bit thin coming from the terrified teen\u2019s perspective. The action near the beginning was pretty entertaining and the climax set in the hurricane was a pretty cool setting. It\u2019s not as exciting or purposeful as the first movie, but luckily there\u2019s enough charm and care put into this to make it a decent sequel worth your time if you liked the first one.",
