Great story, well written and Todd Phillips did good bringing this to screen. Whole cast excels convincingly in character. Lots of wheeling and dealing, drama, dilemma, plot twists, suspense, action and it does have that \"real life\" feel to it. Very well done and very entertaining. Oh, and definitely not a comedy ...",

It is a serious movie about a serious subject; it presents information about arms procurement and war profits made from it how much it by whom.  Whoever wrote this movie knows the subject very well.",

    "text": "I liked it, but I got the sense, that it is trying so hard to be funny and just doesnt succed, because its too serious. For example, Jonahs laugh is hilarious, but seems a bit out of place, because the rest of the movie is not. In my opinion, either make it dead serious, or as ironic as possible. The mix doesnt work.",

    "text": "A Biopic comedy drama. Excellent editing and it's really well made all around. The structure is pretty much Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street mixed together. Todd Phillips is clearly a big fan of Scorese in general in his works. Hill is phenominal in this with great comedy and serving as the \"Tommy\"/\"Micky\" character in this Scorese style flick. He's funny, dangerously psychotic, and an idiot. This does a great job making the technical jargon of Arms Dealing and Govt Regs for dealers easy to understand. The plot expose is really sharp and the dialouge in general is really good the whole way. Plenty of dark comedy in this too. It's funny and fasinating. The one issue here is Miles Teller. He's good but his character is kind of on the boring side a bit. He doesn't become hooked on drugs, he isn't a psycho, or a criminal himself like how other Scorese style films main characters usually do. So when we do explore his life in between events it's a bit boring but it is important. His wife and all is the stereotypical wife who is left in the dark and eventually leaves and may or may not come back with the kid. But she is just alright and isn't really given any serious character and kind of an afterthought. But it's important to the plot and Hill does a great job making Teller''s character interesting he's given great dialouge for the narration to boot. Anyone who is a fan of Scorese pics, the director, the real events behind this, comedies, biopics or war dramas should check this out.",
