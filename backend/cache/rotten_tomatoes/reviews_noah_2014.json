    "text": "Horrible.  They wanted to take the title and biblical history of Noah to gain the Christian demographic/Market, but they also didn\u2019t want to offend people who aren\u2019t or don\u2019t care about the Bible and Christianity.  AND they also didn\u2019t think about or care if they offended Christians by making such drastic changes and departure from the actual biblical history. The result is a character and storyline so far removed from biblical history to gain and please the masses of non-Christian Movie-goers, but needed hold onto the person and title of \u201cNoah\u201d to  market to Christians whom they still hoped would pay for tickets - even if those Christians were led to believe they would be watching the biblical account of Noah - Which this definitely is not.",

    "text": "Absolutely underrated movie, most people watch it expecting it to be a christian movie, that's why they get frustrated; It is not biblically accurate nor it tries to be, it treats the christian mythology as hollywood has always treated others like the greek mythology. This is an absolutely astonishing drama and a very interesting iteration on the myth.",

I\u2019m not sure what drugs the people who gave this a good rating were taking, but just \u201cNo\u201d.  Great cast, but beyond that, just disturbing, dark, and dysmorphic.",

It will not be surpassed on any grounds, writing, cinematography, visual effects, cast interpretation and authenticity, mystery, supernatural, for what it really is. Extremely fascinating and keeps you wanting to see what happens next. Outstanding",

    "text": "Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah is an ambitious reimagining of the biblical story, blending warrior battles with theological myth. Russell Crowe delivers a gripping performance as the tormented Noah, while the film\u2019s bold artistic choices\u2014such as the Watchers, towering rock-like fallen angels\u2014add a unique, though strange, fantasy element. The movie excels in its environmental themes and thought-provoking moral dilemmas but falters in pacing. While Noah is a daring and visually arresting take on the Genesis tale, its mix of blockbuster action and biblical storytelling with only impress a small margin of people.",

Saw Russel Crowe and thought it was a Robin Hood sequel or something but then heard the Noah reference.\n\nFlipped it on to watch while doing a few things in the office.........  It was very watchable and enjoyable.  As a Christian and student of the Bible it was an interesting perspective and screen adaption.",
