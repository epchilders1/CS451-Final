I enjoyed it. I think Rebel Wilson is funny & she played the 17 year old mind in the 37 year old body great. I'm not a critic, just a 67 year old searching for funny  movies.",

    "text": "Senior Year is a lighthearted, entertaining comedy that blends high school nostalgia with a modern twist. Starring Rebel Wilson as a woman who wakes up from a coma 20 years after a cheerleading accident and returns to finish her senior year, the film is filled with over-the-top humor and heartfelt moments. Wilson delivers her signature comedic energy, making the film a fun watch. While the plot can be predictable and a bit cheesy, its feel-good tone and themes of personal growth and second chances keep it enjoyable.",

Ainda n\u00e3o encontrei nenhum filme pior. \nQuando decidi assistir, estava ansiosa para ver, porque prometia uma nostalgia aos anos 90 (\u00e9poca em que fui adolescente), e todo o clich\u00ea de escola de ensino m\u00e9dio e adolescentes, bem \"sess\u00e3o da tarde\" no Brasil. \nMe decepcionei com a qualidade do filme. P\u00e9ssimo, horroroso, mal escrito.\nA Rebel Wilson totalmente sem gra\u00e7a, n\u00e3o tinha nenhum sal, n\u00e3o tinha uma piada que de fato fizesse rir.\nEu n\u00e3o recomendo nem para o meu pior inimigo.",

Dont think or expect too much and just enjoy the ride. \n\nI love how this movie have a meaning that popularity doesnt mean much, and \"perfect life\" is just illusion (the cab scene). What matter the most is people who love us, and the adventures along the way.\n\nIts fun comedy, love the dancing routine..",

The movie provided a couple of chuckles while we were watching it. The 90's soundtrack WAS GREAT. The thing is with movies such as this...the script is pretty predictable.",

    "text": "Senior Year\n\nIn this movie, Stephanie Conway (portrayed by Rebel Wilson), a beloved high school senior aspiring to be prom queen, falls into a coma due to a scheme orchestrated by her nemesis. Two decades later, she emerges from her coma and resolves to complete her senior year.\n\nSenior Year taps into 2000s nostalgia and benefits greatly from Rebel Wilson's comedic prowess. However, it falls short in depth. While the plot shows potential, it quickly feels underdeveloped. The stark contrast between young and older Stephanie is puzzling, as she ages physically but not mentally, seemingly played for laughs.\n\nThe numerous characters here don't elevate the story, and they're not always fully utilised. The ending is rushed, and leaves loose ends; the fate of some characters remains unknown, case in point Tiffany and Blaine.\n\nUltimately, Senior Year is a tropey and predictable flick but it also has its golden moments that help make it tolerable.\n\n5.5/10",
