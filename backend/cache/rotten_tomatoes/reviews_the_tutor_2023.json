    "text": "I suppose it's true that a good thriller will elicit in its viewer an allowance to defy a certain amount of logic. But I don't think the Pope himself could find an ounce of forgiveness for the plot holes and ludicrous twists and turns of the plot in this thrill-less thriller. And as much as I'd like to expand on that thought, I will refrain so as not to spoil anything for those who choose to watch. But suffice it to say, when you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the \"surprises\" that are thrown at you left and right. If any of these characters acted like normal human beings, the movie would last 20 minutes. Hedlund has two registers here - minimalism and hysteria. Schnapp looks as though he's auditioning for a CHILDREN OF THE CORN reboot. There are a hundred unanswered questions at the end, but after the ludicrous finale and the 90 minutes that proceed it, we simply don't care.",

    "text": "What was that? The premise of the film is quite interesting. There was a potentially good film hidden somewhere in there. I like how the movie convinces us to root for the supposed protagonist, only for him to turn out to be the \"villain.\" It becomes predictable after a while because the execution is careless, but it's a decent idea in the context of this story. Perhaps the only decent idea in the whole film. The first half of the movie drags, and unfortunately, that's the better half in terms of cohesion. The \"reveal\" is messy, and the buildup is equally messy because of plot holes and general incoherence. The characters are so flat and uninteresting that the actors try hard to make you want to connect with them. Their performances are indeed good\u2014Schnapp's and Hedlund's\u2014but not even they could save the tacky screenplay, whose every turn just came off as try-hard because almost nothing seemed to work as it should. I haven't even mentioned the obnoxious movie score, which I couldn't seem to ignore. The music doesn't blend well into its scenes. It often feels misplaced; used wrongly for dramatic effect and leaving scenes that are supposed to build tension dull. It just feels so out of place and it's incredibly distracting. \"The Tutor\" is a disappointment for me. It's incredibly boring for a stalker thriller, and too focused on setting up an uneasy atmosphere to build a credible story.",

    "text": "The Tutor feels like someone ripped out the middle chapter of a book and then tried to pass the scraps off as a full story. The setup is there, the actors show up ready to work, but the film spends so little time on actual plot or character development that when the second half veers into its \u201cbig twist,\u201d it doesn\u2019t land with shock\u2014it lands with a clunk. Instead of suspense, you get tonal whiplash, and not the kind that makes a thriller feel unpredictable, just the kind that makes you check your watch.\n\nThe cast does what they can, and you catch glimpses of a better movie buried in their performances, but they\u2019re ultimately stranded by a script that refuses to build them into anything three-dimensional. The protagonist especially suffers, going from underwritten to completely hollow by the end. What should feel like a psychological descent instead plays like a writer skipping steps to get to the climax.\n\nIn the end, The Tutor wastes a capable cast on a story that doesn\u2019t know how to flesh itself out. It\u2019s half a movie at best, a shallow sketch where the middle act should\u2019ve been, and the result is less \u201cthriller\u201d than \u201cunfinished draft accidentally released to theaters.\u201d",

A shoddy attempt at a thriller, with bad directing, acting, and music, this movie is saved by an actually intriguing first half. Its as soon as we see the movie going in the direction that it does in the second half where it falters horribly. Bad movie overall, sadly!",

    "text": "Despite the promise of an intriguing title and a seemingly compelling premise, \"The Tutor\" disappointingly underdelivers. Hindered by a lackluster screenplay, the movie's potential is thwarted at every turn. Characters are flat and one-dimensional, leaving little room for any significant character development. The pacing is erratic, oscillating between prolonged, tedious scenes and hastily stitched together transitions. The cinematography, while occasionally capturing a few striking visuals, mostly feels uninspired. What's most frustrating is the wasted potential, as the narrative framework had the makings of a cinematic masterpiece. However, the execution left much to be desired. Here's to hoping the creators learn from this and come back stronger in their next end\nThis is just a fictional and general critique, and it might not be suitable for the actual content of \"The Tutor.\" If you need more specific criticisms, please provide some context or elements of the movie you'd like to be addressed.",
