I believe this is told from a \"Christian\" perspective, rather than a Roman Catholic one, but it doesn\u2019t detract to my mind.",

It\u2019s refreshing to see something honest and hopeful, instead of the mainstream despair that\u2019s often fed to the public and has caused everyone to grow accustomed to it and overall desensitized.",

I feel like if you\u2019re on a journey walking with God or yearning for a deeper relationship with him , this movie might just push that along further.  I was crying a ridiculous amount and was really healing with this movie as well. I would definitely recommend this movie.",

The portrayal of God as \u201cPapa\u201d is a beautiful reminder that our relationship with Him is not distant or cold, but deeply personal and nurturing. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see some critics twist this into something shameful, showing just how unwilling they are to even try to understand the nature of God\u2019s love. Those who mock this film are often the same people who reject faith altogether\u2014of course, they won\u2019t understand something they refuse to open their hearts to.",
