    "text": "How is this a movie adaptation of a book and yet the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 12 year old for their drama class?!? I was hoping for a mindless movie with beautiful scenery and maybe a saccharine love story but this was 1 hr 45 mins of pure nothingness, even the nature shots weren\u2019t that great, like a film student with a drone. Waste of my time, should\u2019ve turned it off but hoped it might pick up and get better. Shame on all involved, what a disappointment! Now wondering if I should even bother with Katherine Center books.",

I was skeptical because of the reviews, but found the chemistry of the characters, the actors and the story to be enlightening and provide the essence of change, goodness, happiness, and forgiveness. Thank you for such a good movie.",

The characters had their own quirks, nothing too deep going on but fun and funny. The ending was very clear from the start but I didn't mind the journey to get there. Perfect rainy day movie.",

That\u2019s how I feel about Happiness for Beginners. It doesn\u2019t seem like director and writer Vicky Wight was going for movie of the year with this one. Simple settings, simple story, simple love. There\u2019s a lot left to be desired but overall I\u2019m not mad I watched it.",

    "text": "Happiness for Beginners is a strange movie because it should have been a light & fluffy Hallmark-style rom-com, but for some reason they decided to throw in a few words and references to make it PG-13 and that salt kind of ruins the sweet. Also, Ellie Kemper\u2019s character comes off a little too ornery and it makes her somewhat unlikeable. The rest of the characters each have a fun moment or two, but they\u2019re mostly just scenery, and the plot takes the well-worn trail of many romantic comedies that came before it. I wasn\u2019t as annoyed with Happiness for Beginners as I thought I might be. It\u2019s fine.",

I don't quite get that because it is a pretty decent RomCom with a nice Love Message to it. Bottom line? A happy moviegoing experience begins here.",

    "text": "Love a rom com, absolutely hated this! Boring, story was pretty grim and mostly main characters lack any chemistry.  Because of grimes I had high hopes, but I hated every minute of this film! The love story between them was utterly unconvincing.  I\u2019ve seen better hallmark movies to be honest.  Feels like a low budget amateur film made by a group of high schoolers for a school project.",

Sadly the movie was extremely disappointing. It didn\u2019t stick to the storyline of what actually took place. The movie left out so much of what made the romance and connection so beautiful in the book. I also agree there was no chemistry between the main characters.",
