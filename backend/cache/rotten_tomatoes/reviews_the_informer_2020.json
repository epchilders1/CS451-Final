    "text": "I watched this on dvd recently.  It's violent and brutal at times, although the story starts off well and the scenes set in New York are quite exciting to watch.  However, once Pete is sent back to prison it looses it's finesse and it feels like a different low budget episode of the first part.  This is another one of those movies where the NYPD and FBI don't get on which reminded me of how different Councils used to clash, despite working cooperatively as public sector stake holders!\nThe plot is far too complicated and reaches the point where the credibility of the whole story is lost, resulting in an empty experience for the viewer.  The more I watched the worse it seemed and I soon began to hope it would end.  I fast forwarded through some of it to lessen the ordeal. Sadly, I can't recommend this movie.",

You get more than your money's worth with this flick.\n\nAnd to make it even better, Joel Kinnaman gave you a victim of the system character that you could pull for through the entire movie. Good job by all!!",

If you're up for a dawdling movie to pass the time away, half watching while you are on your phone, this is a movie for you.",

Por\u00e9m quando tudo irira terminar, ocorre um problema de assassinarem um policial e ele \u00e9 obrigado a assumir a responsabilidade e \u00e9 enviado a pris\u00e3o. Na pris\u00e3o d\u00e3o a ele uma miss\u00e3o. Quando ele cumpre \u00e9 tra\u00eddo pelo FBI. Sua fam\u00edlia tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 pega pela m\u00e1fia ent\u00e3o ele fica num mato sem cachorro. At\u00e9 que no fim ele consegue fugir da pris\u00e3o e resgatar a fam\u00edlia, eleminar o mafioso e os traidores serem desmascarados. Joel teve uma boa atua\u00e7\u00e3o, mas Ana teve mais, pena \u00e9 o seu cabelo cacheado loiro que a deixou horr\u00edvel. O filme foi meio raso nos assuntos e nas cenas. Um filme razo\u00e1vel.\nRoteiro: teve momentos que for\u00e7aram. Mas mediano\nVale apena assistir? Se n\u00e3o tiver outra op\u00e7\u00e3o e voc\u00ea gostar de filme policiais.\nNota: 6",
