Movies were great from 2015 and down\nHonestly what a waste they did with actor penny (the policemen) doesn\u2019t fit him as a police character because he was a great character for the movie Batman as two face.\nI think producers should look at old movies before making a movie, stop making movies just because they have the money and can hire the actors to make a movie, or use at least what everyone is using CHAT GPT",
