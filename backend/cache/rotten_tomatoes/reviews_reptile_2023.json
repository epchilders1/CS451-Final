    "text": "I like that movie. It has its pace, slow, but building up, step by step. Small hints given to me, and full picture building up, brick by brick. And then, just one small detail changing everything. Black becomes white, and white becomes black. And now, you think you guessed all correctly, but another turn in story, and you again in doubt, lost in guesses and assumptions.\nI like that movie has fully finished story. There is start, middle and end. Final end, end of story, all clear in last 5 seconds. There is no way for that movie to continue, no open stories to do Reptile 2. \nBrilliant actors, perfect cast.\nAmazing music.\nI am over 40 years old, and for me, its often difficult to watch movies, as I have seen it all, nothing new.\nBut its not like that with Reptile, it has its unique features, no sense of, ' it was in Simpsons'.\nMovie allows you to know how it ends, you can figure it out, but you must take notice of every frame, hints are out there, but only seen them when watched movie for the second time, and then they look obvious.\nGood movie, watch, enjoy.",

Ancored by a brooding, magnetic performance from Benicio del Toro, the film crafts a moody, atmospheric descent into a murder investigation that\u2019s as much about the psychology of its characters as it is about solving the crime.\n\nDel Toro plays Detective Tom Nichols, a man caught between the unraveling of a brutal homicide and the quiet disintegration of trust in his own world. His portrayal is layered and restrained, giving the film its emotional weight. There\u2019s a weariness in his eyes that speaks volumes, and his ability to convey suspicion, empathy, and quiet rage without overplaying it is masterful.\n\nDirector Grant Singer, in his feature debut, brings a music video sensibility to the visuals\u2014stylized but never flashy. The cinematography is cold and deliberate, echoing the film\u2019s themes of deception and hidden motives. The pacing is deliberate, sometimes bordering on glacial, but it serves the narrative\u2019s creeping tension well.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Alicia Silverstone and Justin Timberlake, deliver solid performances, though the film remains firmly in del Toro\u2019s orbit. The script occasionally leans into familiar noir tropes, but it\u2019s elevated by its commitment to ambiguity and moral complexity. This isn\u2019t a whodunit that spoon-feeds answers\u2014it\u2019s a meditation on the corrosive nature of secrets.\n\n\u201cReptile\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. It could have trimmed some of its runtime, and certain plot threads feel underdeveloped. But its atmosphere, performances, and thematic depth make it a compelling entry in the genre. It\u2019s a film that lingers, like a shadow in the corner of the room.\n\nMy Verdict: A moody, methodical thriller with a standout lead performance. Not for those seeking fast-paced action, but ideal for viewers who appreciate a slow burn with psychological heft.",

    "text": "Typical murder mystery where a cop discovers that his corrupt buddy cops are in on it. Same, same, same. Plot holes and senseless twists abound. We never do find out why the victim had bite marks. At one point, our hero has his gun confiscated  after he kills a skulking suspect, but he is cleared and has it restored. This episode is a big deal story point. However, in the big obligatory shoot out finale, he kills the two crooked cops and it is just pure victory. Apparently if it is the big finale you get to shoot up everybody all over the place, cops and everything,  and it is all triumph. Great performance by Del Toro, but the big shoot out finale is \"Oh please, this again?\" Also features some incredibly bad square dancing.",

The movie begins as a rather unremarkable murder mystery, however, by the middle of the movie, you have to stop whatever else you're doing and begin to pay strict attention as your jaw drops. \nBenecio del Toro's middle-aged, weather-beaten face and his demeanor as a jaded, world-weary Detective who still doggedly pursues answers to his unwanted questions, is brilliant. The shocks can be breath taking.\nThis is one of only a handful of movies that I'll be watching twice.",

Really impressed by it.\n\nThe good: Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro.\n\nThis man has got charisma few other actors (are lucky to) have. He really steals the show, with his very subtle acting skills, that convey so many different feelings that simply watching Benicio del Toro lifting up a small glass to drink is fascinating to watch.\n\nBenicio del Toro co-wrote the screenplay and he co-produced this movie as well. So he had a lot of cloud. And it shows, because this is one heck of a Benicio del Toro flick.\n\nThe director made his feature movie debut, with only having made lots of music videos before and although I dont think his direction was terrific, it certainly was a masterful debut.\n\nQuite impressed AND spooked out by it. Recommended for the art house movie fans of slowburning (yet still suspenseful) detective movies.",

    "text": "Reptile tries to captivate as a dark thriller, but only offers an average plot. The story about an investigator who solves a murder case is at times formulaic and not very innovative. Despite a solid performance from Benicio del Toro, the film often remains stuck in familiar patterns. The atmosphere is successful, but the character development and twists are weak and unsurprising. The plot drags on and the finale disappoints with a feeling of ambiguity. A solid but not very gripping thriller experience.",
