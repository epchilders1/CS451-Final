    "text": "\u201cCan You Keep A Secret?\u201d, es la pel\u00edcula rom\u00e1ntica a la que acudimos cuando queremos sentirnos mejor. Tiene tan marcados los conflictos en cada acto que no hay sorpresas, ya sabes que se van a enamorar, que va a haber un conflicto en el punto clim\u00e1tico de la cinta, y que posteriormente van a terminar juntos, pero yo creo que el problema con esta es que no est\u00e1 adornada con nada caracter\u00edstico, no se siente una intencionalidad en que aunque ya conozcamos justo lo que va a pasar en cada escena, sea bajo con contexto interesante, y no dir\u00eda que argumentativamente le resta, pero si en cuanto a originalidad entre cientos de propuestas iguales.\n\nPero para mi lo que la hace especial, es la qu\u00edmica entre Alexandra Daddario y Tyler Hoechlin, realmente te sientes bien en cada escena rom\u00e1ntica que tienen. Y los personajes secundarios no me parecieron malos, si, son los estereot\u00edpicos amigos que cumplen una funci\u00f3n dentro de la trama, pero logran ser emp\u00e1ticos, y en ellos hay chistes que si funcionan. Visualmente es agradable y aunque no arriesga nada, si se desarrolla en lugares visualmente atractivos. \n\nAl final ya todos sabemos a lo que vamos cuando vemos una pel\u00edcula c\u00f3mo estas que es m\u00e1s un encargo de una productora, que un producto con intenciones reales, por lo que se me har\u00eda muy pretencioso indagar en defectos t\u00e9cnicos o narrativos. Este es un g\u00e9nero al que regularmente recurro cuando solo quiero ver algo para pasar el tiempo, y tambi\u00e9n me parece importante que este tipo de propuestas sigan existiendo. Son la excusa para ver con la familia, con amigos o, para ver solo comiendo palomitas. Es una entrega que repetir\u00eda, porque, aunque ya hayamos visto esta misma historia contada de mil maneras diferentes pero siempre con la misma conclusi\u00f3n, te hace sentir bien contigo mismo una vez terminada.",

    "text": "The problem with this film is that it deletes more than half the source material. Structurally, a major plot point in the novel comes after about 80% of the book. Here, it comes before the halfway point, so there isn't enough build-up to give it weight. \nMost of Emma's characterization is removed, including her loveable loser life, her family, and her career struggles. As one example, her boss in the book is a man who overlooks her work and refuses to replace the department secretary. Here, it's a trans woman making sympathetic faces and having little function other than being the token LGBTQ+ character. \nEmma's family is a HUGE piece of the book, adding much to her self-doubt and low self-esteem. Again, gone. \nAdaptations can be tricky. This one didn't have to be. There is room for story, backstory, and characterization. It's just been taken out for no good reason at all.",

    "text": "Can You Keep A Secret was predictable but a good movie to watch for a brainless night. The script for each character was very surface level and doesn't capture the message that I think it was trying to portray. Firstly, when the Characters meet on the place she spills secrets that are mostly comical, others just plain stupid, but none very embarrassing. I know that there are women that get stuck in relationships out of loneliness but it didn't send those emotions because Alexandra's character just didn't come off as an awkward lonely girl. So when the time came that the boss \"spills\" her secrets, it felt more like a proclamation of his adoration for her. They really reached trying to make that a climax for her feeling betrayed but it was so forced by the coworkers joking about nothing serious. They needed better writes and someone who looked more like the lawyer roommate as the actress for the role.",

    "text": "Not as bad as the critics would have you believe, but still... not that good.\nAlexandra is a terrific actress (see White Lotus) - but here, she's miscast.\nI don't buy her goofy aloofness or self-deprecating actions and dialogue that comes with this character. Her face is not emotive enough for her to wear her heart on her sleeve. And she has zero chemistry with Tyler - who's pretty good in this.\nTo make matters worse, this movie was stuffed with every ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender that you feel like you're watching a diversity training seminar instead of a real story. The inclusiveness of side character casting stuck out like a sore thumb and made too much of this movie ring false. \nThe \"misunderstandings\" that cause the girl-lose-guy were dumb and the \"big secret\" that Tyler's been keeping is laughably stupid and implausible. \nThe set-up of a goofy girl spilling all her secrets and then later seeing her try to cover them up was the charming and fun of the story. But it doesn't last long enough to make this a \"must see.\" What's also missing is how these two characters really complete each other. By the end, we - as the audience - never felt the magic and the desire for the 2 main characters to get (and stay) together, because we never believed that they had any magic and needed each other.",
