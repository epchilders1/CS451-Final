Supposedly the grinch is supposed to be a well mannered lord from 16th century Downton Abbey. I'd take his review with a grain of salt, the man has probably never even seen Nacho Libre! I mean come on now.",

I dont know what the directors were thinking when they made this movie and they were probably on acid. The movie makes me bleed internally, and the fact that my friends from work love this movie makes me question our friendship. Its not funny, everything is overly forced and I wish this movie stayed in satan\u2019s diary. I HATE this movie.",

It is to this day one of the most requested and most popular Christmas movies. ANY critics that are rating this 3 stars and below ought to be ashamed of themselves. If you know ANYTHING about film or theatre this movie is a masterpiece.",

Ron Howard did good in bringing this to screen. Beautifully written and executed. Lots of intrigue, drama, suspense, comical situations and pure magic. Highly entertaining",

Jim Carrey\u2019s How the Grinch Stole Christmas has been one of my all-time favorite holiday films ever since it came out, and I\u2019ve watched it at least once every single year. No matter how old I get, it still hits the same way it did the first time.\n\nJim Carrey gives one of the greatest comedic performances ever put on screen \u2014 not just for a Christmas movie, but for any movie. His energy, expressions, the voice, the physical comedy, the timing\u2026 everything is perfect. You can tell he put everything he had into the role. Nobody else could have played the Grinch with that same balance of sarcasm, humor, heart, and chaos.\n\nThe world of Whoville is fun, colorful, and full of personality, and the film does an amazing job expanding Dr. Seuss\u2019s classic story into a full movie without losing the original spirit. The makeup, costumes, music, and sets still look incredible even today. For a movie made over twenty years ago, it\u2019s held up unbelievably well.\n\nWhat makes it special is that it\u2019s not just funny \u2014 it\u2019s genuine. Under all the jokes and sarcasm, the movie has a big heart. The message about kindness, acceptance, and finding joy again always hits home, especially around the holidays. Jim Carrey brings so much emotion to the character that you actually feel for the Grinch by the end.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a Christmas movie for me \u2014 it\u2019s a tradition. It\u2019s something I can put on every year and know it\u2019ll make me laugh, put me in a good mood, and remind me what the holidays are supposed to feel like. It\u2019s timeless, and it gets better every time I watch it.\n\nJim Carrey absolutely made this movie iconic, and it will always be one of the best holiday films ever made.",

I'm sorry your degree in cinematic arts makes it impossible to enjoy things. Sometimes pristine storytelling isn't the point, you have to meet films where they're at. This movie delivers on exactly what it was intending to do.",
