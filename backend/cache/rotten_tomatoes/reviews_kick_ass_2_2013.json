It was so much fun to watch and there were so many hilariously epic moments that made it an absolute joy to sit through. I definitely recommend it for superhero, action, and comedy fans!",

    "text": "Kick-Ass 2, while thankfully sanitizing the extreme storyline from the comics it\u2019s adapting, seems to be a rollercoaster of hits and misses based on its current direction. The dynamic of the cast, the humor, and the action remain, but the story is quite convoluted and doesn\u2019t elevate the franchise to the same level as the first. In reality, it risks portraying this version as an inappropriate teen comedy that sexualizes underaged actresses at the time and simplistically follows up on a successful first film.\n\nGrading: C+",

Some Really Fake Looking Moments with Blood, Vomit and Green Screen But nonetheless, you can't take these Movies seriously and I think if Matthew Vaughn directed this then it would be better but Aaron Taylor Johnson and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz do a great job but a standout is Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Mico aka; The MotherF******who was absolutely Hilarious! Can't Wait for thr Kick-Ass Reboot!",
