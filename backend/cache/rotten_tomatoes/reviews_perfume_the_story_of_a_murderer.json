    "text": "Perfume is a horror film in many ways, and the horror is the realization that our \"hero\" is horribly lost in his obsession.  It's a period piece in France about a young man in search of controlling the power of smell.  It's fairly graphic with some hard to watch scenes, but beautifully filmed, excellent script and an engaging original concept.  Fine acting and set design make this gritty world easy to be lost in. Well worth a watch.",

This is a great film - you've become to young or inexperienced to give reviews on films that cut through the usual and indulge you in an adult fairy story without meeting your youthful modern sensibilities because you don't understand this, because you weren't alive when 'The Company of Wolves\" was made - and others of this genre. Take your brain out sometimes, just believe, and enjoy.\nI've nevet heard of twyker & whatever his previous, I take things as I see them - loved it.",

    "text": "Tykwer's S\u00fcskind adaptation never transcends mediocrity; the novel's plot is filmed too awkwardly. A generic score lingers over the TV-quality images, and there's never any tension or interest in the characters. Ben Wishaw, on the other hand, is great, as is Alan Rickman (when he finally shows up after 80 minutes); Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, is completely in camp mode. All in all, a typical 'airs on network TV on a Sunday afternoon' historical/arthouse romp that doesn't dare to do anything. But I really want to read the novel now; it seems truly excellent.",

    "text": "The scent of an object may seem the least significant among all other senses that stimulate the perception, for which reason it can never be extracted, can never be preserved, but is only echoed to such that it is tampered with. It essentially loses its novelty. Be that as it may, a scent equates to a particular beauty to which one may be enticed. Yet it never remains and eventually dies out. When that happens, yearning is inevitable.\n\nAs in the film, Grenouille sought a way to preserve the scent of beauty (literally the young ladies), taking extreme measures to do so. Ironic as it may be, he did not have a personal scent, therefore clenching to those of others. Such a mere talent he possessed became a menacing obsession\u2014an obsession out of \u201clove.\u201d This love may be the representation of the beguiling scents of the women he murdered, forcefully and cruelly extracting it out of them. In the end, Grenouille himself vanished out of love\u2014not a single residual left for all the love that he bestowed upon himself; it was devoured.\n\nA peculiar movie, it may seem, but twofold. Not much dialogue is spoken throughout, but it is still able to tell, rendering how passion turns into a haunting pursuit of cruelty.",

    "text": "This film reminded me of, and has quite a bit in common with, Kubricks masterpiece, \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d.  Both are visually dazzling, both are adapted from admired literary works and both tales tell of rather unsympathetic antiheroes and both rely heavily on a narrator. But whereas Kubricks film was uninterested in plot, this films director definitely is and his screenplay is quite plot heavy\u2026and that\u2019s the big difference: Kubricks adaption is cinematic, this one isn\u2019t. The narrator in \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d complimented the visuals, the narrator here (the magnificent John Hurt) doesn\u2019t compliment, he distracts and too frequently is used to over explain and then over explain again. It\u2019s feels less of a creative choice and more of an annoying necessity. There\u2019s just something about this story that is not suited to the visual medium. Despite the best efforts of all involved, this story seems like it refuses to be cinematic\u2014I\u2019m assuming holding its full impact within the pages of the novel. However, the composition of the cinematography and the cast are strong enough to cover up its weaknesses and it is definitely worth a viewing\u2026or two.",

    "text": "\"Perfume\" . The film's opening in a grim, chaotic Parisian market immerses me  in the filthy, raw atmosphere that shapes the protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Its cinematography masterfully conveys his heightened sense of smell, using rich visuals and color grading to depict the beauty and obsession of scent-making. The film's ending is haunting and unforgettable: Grenouille pours his perfect perfume on himself in the same market, causing the crowd to fall into an ecstatic frenzy, only to end in his tragic, self-inflicted demise.",

    "text": "What ultimately let's this movie down is not its cast or dialogue but it's attempt to end the movie on a statement about the power of scent which ascends humanity rather than the protagonist finding his humanity through the power of scent. The movie starts out telling a fairly sad tale about a young man, played by Ben Whishaw, with a gift for scent and some obvious social flaws which result in him accidentally murdering a young woman whose smell he spends the rest of the movie recreating through a series of further murders. Whilst the premise up until this point is fairly reasonable and enticing, especially when he tries to learn the secret of perfume making from Dustin Hoffman and tries to recreate the smell of the woman he murdered and obviously feels responsible for. However the movie takes a weird turn after he has completes his masterpiece perfume from a dozen or so dead girls, including the daughter of a Lord played by Alan Rickman. The protagonist is then sentenced to death by beheading at the town square but just before his impending death, he opens the perfume bottle which results in the biggest orgy in movie history involving the very townspeople who wanted him dead. The follow-up scene depicts him being let go and ultimately being torn apart by tenants of a local French slum leaves viewers perplexed and let down. The moral of the movie is not evil being punished or even the fragility of a single scent can never be created again so enjoy it while you can. No it's if you brew enough blondes and brunettes with some flowers you can get a city to orgasym and become a hamburger for the poor. 0.5/5",
