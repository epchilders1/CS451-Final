    "text": "My 8 year old daughter chose this for our movie night and I just thought it would be another talking dog movie that I\u2019d half-heartedly watch. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. I found this film brilliant. Very well shot. True to life (if dogs were to talk). It tells the story of the dogs life from when he gets adopted, until the end, in his words. He has such a great life with his family. There is a tragedy in the movie which struck very close to home for me- I will give nothing away. Had I have known about this in the movie, I wouldn\u2019t have watched it as I knew I would have been a blubbering mess. I was a massive wreck. My poor child was worried for me having never seen me watch a \u2018sad\u2019 film. However, I\u2019m glad I watched it. I loved it. Yes it\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s also happy. Life happens. Life is sad at times. It\u2019s also happy. But life always goes on the way it should. The ending is good, lovely twist and happy. \n\nWell worth a watch. But have the tissue ready.",

Being a dog person and car racer this leaves me in a state of emotional heart break for the last hour or so.  It's a unique film with a bespoke approach that makes a refreshing change from the garbage often produced by Hollywood nowadays.  Although I'm not sure how many more times I'm able to watch this film before I'm an emotional wreck! \ud83d\ude02",
