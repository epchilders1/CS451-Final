    "text": "Shrek becomes a startlingly intense dark fantasy where the fairy-tale world turns vicious and unpredictable. The film\u2019s surreal creatures and twisted landscapes take on a menacing tone, and its bursts of unexpectedly graphic violence make it far more disturbing than its colourful exterior suggests\u2014certainly not suitable for all viewers.\n\nShrek himself becomes a brooding, volatile figure, misunderstood but undeniably dangerous, while the quest through forests, castles, and swamps feels more like a descent into a realm where every joke hides sharp teeth. Even the film\u2019s humour gains a sinister edge, giving the story an uncanny blend of menace and absurdity.\n\nStrange, violent, and unexpectedly gripping, this version of Shrek plays like a fairy tale told around a campfire to frighten rather than comfort\u2014and it works.",

OK, the animation looks a tad dated, but there are \"fashionable\" Oscar winners with less heart, cleverness, truth and laugh out loud moments than this.  A total joy.",

    "text": "Wow, wow, wow. I have no words of how to describe how good this film is. Everything about it: the animation, the way the characters acted, even the music. This is hands down the best animated film of all time. From the grumpy yet charming ogre Shrek to the hilarious chatty Donkey, the characters are just the beginning. We also get jokes referencing rhymes and fairy tale things, like the muffin man and the three blind mice. Also a pretty deep story, while subverting the common tropes. \nThe animation is very good for 2001 and still holds up in many ways nowadays (minus the characters, though). Music is just wonderful, especially with all those great pop songs thrown in there. And finally...keep out of my swamp!\nI definitely recommend you seeing it if you didn't already; it's something you can't miss!",

The animation may be over 20 years old, but it still feels fresh and full of personality.\n\nShrek and Donkey\u2019s friendship is hilarious and touching, and the film\u2019s message about being yourself never gets old. A perfect mix of fairy tale fun and clever humor that works for both kids and adults. Solid 9/10, an absolute classic! \ud83e\uddc5\ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udc51",
