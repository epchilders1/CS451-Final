The sets, cinematography, and acting were all understated in a refreshing, non-Hollywood way. The clothes and house were dirty, and the people were not great-looking, just like real life. Loved it!",

    "text": "First off, I enjoyed watching this film. It has a lot of classic elements that work. It has a sincerity and straightforwardness that is refreshing. However, I am kind of torn on it and somewhat surprised by the very high ratings it has. I guess people are just really thirsty for a very simple, unironic, western. This film was surprisingly modest in all respects, which is has a certain charm, but I also kind of agree with one critic who said this film lacks ambition. I was hoping for something more in the vein of 2003's \"Open Range\" in terms of a modern western. This movie feels more like a small stage-play than a grand sweeping western. It's interesting to note that this film has zero women in it, at all, for its entirety. I don't mean to point that out as a criticism or a negative thing. I just point it out because it highlights how narrow the scope of this film is. We also don't really see any other sets/properties other than Henry's farm. Also, the runtime of the film is relatively short. This film almost feels like more of a short film than a full movie. Again none of these things are necessarily bad things on their own. This movie basically succeeds in what it sets out to do. But in the larger picture I think there is legitimacy to the criticism that this movie lacks ambition. P.S. some of the action sequences are weirdly dull. This may have been intentional - they may have been going for a very mundane, realistic interpretation of what a shootout would have really looked like in the old west, but it's also, well, kind of dull and doesn't really satisfy the previous buildup of tension. All that said, this is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the western genre and are interested in modern interpretations of the genre. Tim Blake Nelson is really great as this character.",

    "text": "A riveting modern western that combines suspense and violence with the underdog narrative of an apparent farmer facing off against a stronger force. \n\nThe visual shots are nothing short of spectacular and help to keep your eyes glued to the screen. The twists and turns of the plot caught me off guard at times as well. \n\nA great movie overall, one of the best modern westerns with no frills, and Tim Blake Nelson shines as bright as he ever did.",

Pire encore, j'ai rapidement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que ce film \u00e9tait un remake d\u00e9guis\u00e9 d'Unforgiven, mais sans le g\u00e9nie de son auteur, sans souffle ni id\u00e9es. Le sc\u00e9nario, tr\u00e8s simpliste, pourrait tenir sur un timbre-poste, ce qui ne serait pas un probl\u00e8me si le r\u00e9alisateur avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 le rendre captivant ou \u00e0 lui donner du sens. Mais non, c'est terriblement vide, sans \u00e2me. Quant au twist final, il est risible, tout comme la sc\u00e8ne de mort du m\u00e9chant dans la for\u00eat, mal pens\u00e9e, mal r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, compl\u00e8tement rat\u00e9e.
