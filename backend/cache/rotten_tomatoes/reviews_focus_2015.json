    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Focus es ese tipo de pel\u00edcula que te pones para desconectar y, sin hacer magia, te mantiene enganchado lo justo. No es el gran thriller de estafadores que promete ser, pero tiene suficiente ritmo y descaro como para que el tiempo pase sin mirar el reloj. Y en un g\u00e9nero donde es f\u00e1cil aburrir a mitad de camino, eso ya es una peque\u00f1a victoria.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s sostiene la pel\u00edcula es la pareja protagonista. Will Smith tiene ese encanto autom\u00e1tico que arrastra incluso cuando el guion patina, y Margot Robbie ilumina cada escena con una mezcla de carisma y naturalidad que hace que todo parezca m\u00e1s s\u00f3lido de lo que realmente es. Su qu\u00edmica funciona, aunque la historia no siempre est\u00e9 a la altura de ellos dos.\n\nLa trama juega a sorprender m\u00e1s de lo que puede soportar. Hay giros que te los ves venir desde el otro lado de la habitaci\u00f3n, y otros que rozan lo imposible, pero como el tono nunca se toma demasiado en serio, acaba funcionando como una especie de espect\u00e1culo elegante y ligero. Es cine de estafas \"de superficie\": bonito de ver, r\u00e1pido, con di\u00e1logos \u00e1giles\u2026 pero sin ese ingenio que te deja repasando el truco despu\u00e9s.\n\nAl final queda justo en medio: entretenida, con momentos brillantes, pero sin ese golpe final que haga memorable lo que has visto. Es una mezcla curiosa entre comedia, romance y timo cl\u00e1sico, y aunque no encaja del todo, s\u00ed consigue lo b\u00e1sico: que pases un buen rato sin pedirle m\u00e1s de la cuenta.\n\n(ENGLISH) Focus is one of those films you put on when you want something light, fast and uncomplicated. It never becomes the sharp, clever con-artist thriller it tries to imitate, but it moves with enough style to keep you watching without checking your phone. In a genre that easily collapses halfway through, that\u2019s already something.\n\nThe real draw is the duo at the center. Will Smith leans on his natural charm, and even when the script gets wobbly, he holds the scene together. Margot Robbie is the real surprise here: bright, funny and effortlessly magnetic. Their chemistry doesn\u2019t fix the film, but it makes the ride smoother and much more enjoyable.\n\nThe plot wants to be twisty, sometimes too much. You can see some turns coming from a mile away, and others stretch credibility to the limit. Still, the movie isn\u2019t pretending to be airtight; it plays more like glossy entertainment with quick dialogue and visual polish. It\u2019s \"surface-level\" con-artist cinema: stylish, fun to watch, but never as smart as it thinks it is.\n\nIn the end, it sits right in the middle. Entertaining, lively, occasionally clever, but far from unforgettable. It\u2019s the kind of movie that works once and doesn\u2019t need a second viewing \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that when it delivers what it promises.",

    "text": "This movie did not hold up as well upon a second viewing.  Smith and Robbie didn't have convincing screen chemistry to make the romantic element stick.  Robbie is a good actress, but they did not give her a character with any depth. The scams and cons were imaginative (often far fetched) as a diversion, but somehow the whole plot did not hold together that well.  In the end the parts did not add up to a satisfying whole.",

    "text": "That was fun, with good twists and solid pacing. Some plot points felt a little sloppy, especially the scenes meant to throw the viewer off the scent. They don\u2019t fully add up once you see the whole picture. Overall, though, it's an enjoyable movie with charismatic leads. It strikes a good balance between keeping the viewer in the dark and still making them feel like they know what\u2019s going on. The con was on and I genuinely didn't know what was going to happen. Fun time.",

    "text": "Premise was good, but the movie could not keep it together. After the pivot to New Orleans, the plot thickened. It seemed interesting at first, but once the scene shifted toward the auto racing, it took a quick detour. The plot unraveled, becoming unrealistic. The third act was unrewarding and felt like a cheat after the better writing in the 1st and middle acts. \n\nOverall a disappointment of a film with good acting and a good setup.",

    "text": "The twists and tactics are a bit too surreal for the theme this movie was going for.  The chemistry between Mr. Smith and Mrs. Robbie wasn't bad, but could have been better.  The movie invested a lot of screentime into it and there was enough intimacy but there wasn't really enough emotion.  Not enough smiling and laughing during conversation, which is arguably more important for more immersion into the romance of the two.  This movie should have just had Will Smith play a cold heartless mob boss that robbed people at gun point instead of these unrealistic mind games and impossible pickpocketing.  It just breaks immersion when you have so much surrealism in a movie that's supposed to be realistic.  I feel like the directors tried to use Will's charismatic smoothness to \"smoothly\" pickpocket, or gamble, and... I didn't appreciate the bridge.  It would have been better to just introduce an evil, darker, and more violent side from Will to make it more believable, and aid in immersion, even if it meant going outside of Will's main comfort zone.  Directors also relied too much of Margot's charisma and attractive appearance for the chemistry between the two, as aforementioned her role needed more smiling and laughing while talking with Will.  The sensual scenes were good but lacked emotional depth.  She did a good job with her scene of emotional devastation, but there wasn't enough connection with Margot's character at that time to connect with her.  Will had too much screentime.  There wasn't enough internal struggle between Will and Margot either during the film when they were re uniting.  I think the director realized this and made it appear that Margot wasn't going to show up to meet Will by having her come late, but that's not internal struggle with re uniting, that's a cheap attempt at trying to elicit a connection between the audience and Will, and it didn't work, at least not with me.  And it didn't work with me because, as aforementioned, there wasn't any internal struggle for there to be a buildup for emotion during that scene.  Overall, poor use of actors, and weak development.  This could have easily been a 5/5 movie.  More emotions from both characters during ordinary conversation, less surreal pickpocket tactics and more violent robbery tactics, more development and screen time on Margot's character prior to the scene she's abandoned, and more internal struggle between Margot's and Will's character when Will tried to reunite.  Wasted masterpiece.",

I recall the football gambling scene was really well done so I knew that scene was coming and always enjoyed its outcome. It\u2019s mostly a fun, feel good movie with an air of sophistication and class somewhat reminiscent of Ocean\u2019s Eleven but not nearly as enjoyable. The acting between Smith and Margot Robbie is palpable making it more entertaining of a watch. Everything\u2019s a little too slick/easy for Smith per the usual but if there\u2019s anyone to make it look real he used to be that guy without it coming off as far-fetched (it just gets old after awhile).",
