We've known for years that big Pharma caters to, brides and pay doctors in accepting their drugs and writing prescriptions for them.\n\nBelieve me, I've seen plenty of drug companies rent out an entire theatre and give doctors all kinds of perks. Trips, money and incredible expensive items.\n\nIn addition, character played by Emily Blunt is spot on in appearance and demeanor. Drug reps strut like peacocks into these doctor offices to tout their goods. I've even heard them joking and flirting when in the next room It's all a game and the patients are the guinea pigs. I wouldn't trust the FDA as far as I could throw them.",

    "text": "It\u2019s a mix of The Big Short and The Wolf of Wall Street, but not as accomplished as either. The difference here is that the unlike the peddlers of penny stocks and junk loans, both of which are bullshit all the way down, good intentions were at the heart of pushing Lonafen on doctors. The pharma company makes money, the doctors make money, and the patients have their pain relieved, win-win-win. Unsurprisingly, once the system gets rolling (and by rolling, I mean the company goes public) there is no incentive but profit and the powers that be jettison their mission for the eternal chase of the almighty dollar \u2014 a perfect analogy to those who chase that initial ecstasy of opiates. The rise and fall of the company is shown through the eyes of Liza (Emily Blunt), in an as rags-to-riches story as you can get. Sure, it\u2019s predictable, but it\u2019s also entertaining and has solid performances from Blount, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, and Amit Shah. Chloe Colman feels like the child actor of 2023 and will always play the child of a biracial couple. The RT critics\u2019 is an abysmal (23), which just isn\u2019t right. This is a good movie with a message that you likely didn\u2019t need any convincing of its message in the first place \u2014 profit and healthcare sometimes cause problems \u2014 but is enjoyable nonetheless.",

    "text": "*Pain Hustlers* had all the makings of a hit with a cast like Chris Evans, Emily Blunt, and Catherine O'Hara, so I was excited going in. However, the film turned out to be a major letdown. Emily Blunt shines and really carries the movie, but it\u2019s hard to overlook the messy editing and strange pacing. Scenes drag on when they shouldn't, and others that need more depth are rushed. The tone had potential, but David Yates\u2019 vision here feels confused. It\u2019s like a cheap knockoff of *The Wolf of Wall Street* or *The Big Short*, without the spark. Despite some standout moments, the story doesn\u2019t captivate, and I found myself bored for most of it. Overall, it\u2019s a missed opportunity with a cast that deserves better. 2.5 stars.",

This doesn't mean I don't think she pick's great project's to do like Sicario and Merry Poppins which were both huge hits! Pain Hustler's just wasn't as great or completely terrible or even good but not great or awesome either! If that makes sense!?",

    "text": "PAIN HUSTLERS depicts the loosely fact-based tale of Insys Therapeutics and the early years of the opioid crisis, combining elements of self-made success story, corporate biopic and crime drama to create a thoroughly entertaining film that engages larger social issues while remaining grounded in the experience of compelling characters. The skillfully-balanced telling neither sensationalizes the everyday tragedy of the emerging opioid crisis nor demonizes the perpetuators, allowing for a nuanced and insightful depiction of a complex and uniquely American problem. The abysmal RT critic's consensus rating is truly baffling here.",
