    "text": "John Wick 4 effortlessly earns its place among my all time favorites. It\u2019s a visual ballet of violence and elegance. Every frame a work of art, every fight a symphony. The music paired with a rich sound system? Transcendent. Each beat, each gunshot, each echo wraps around you like silk and thunder. It\u2019s more than a movie\u2026 it\u2019s an experience, a masterpiece carved in motion. \ud83d\ude19\ud83e\udd0c\u2728",

    "text": "\"I am Klaus.\"\n\nThe German rave scene was wild. Everyone kept dancing while people got axes to the face right next to them.\n\nThe Paris sightseeing was a highlight, quite a tour. The sets and locations are incredible, very slick, and the overhead, video game\u2013style sequence toward the end was such a cool, stylized way to show the action.\n\nThe action and choreography, while still fun, I gotta say felt a bit off in timing. Some of it seemed unnaturally staged, with pauses or hesitations by the actors that made it seem noticeably staged. Minor concern, but more obvious compared to previous entries in the franchise.\n\nThe Arc de Triomphe car scene was a mind-blowing blend of CGI and stunt work.\n\nAlso gotta say that the blind assassin character was a bit over-the-top. Too gimmicky.\n\nOverall, satisfying showdown and ending and a fun action-packed time.",

The way that John is fighting for his freedom and returns to his wife is an emotional moment. It's sad that John wick has to die, I thought he was going to be the man who cannot be killed, but I guess nothing lasts forever. I'm wondering how they are going to make John Wick 5 now that John is dead. That is my only question to the series.",

    "text": "After the 35th or 50th kill, the spectacle stops serving story and slips into something almost cartoonish \u2014 except instead of slapstick pies and pratfalls, it\u2019s headshots and knives.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of over-saturation of violence. In older action films, the kill count usually escalated toward a climax \u2014 the audience saw danger and payoff. With Wick (and films like it), the sheer repetition blurs the line: Are we still watching a character fight for survival, or are we watching a violent ballet just for itself?\n\nThis is a \u2018\u2019Disney fantasy gone wrong\u201d l \u2014 it\u2019s the same formula: a heightened, stylized world where rules don\u2019t apply. Only instead of enchanted forests and talking animals, it\u2019s assassins in nightclubs and endless ammunition.",

If you are a fan of overly choreographed fight scenes that go on forever than maybe, just maybe you'll enjoy this flick. I found the first three previous movies to be fun but this was way over the top. The plot stalled to make room for all the endless fight scenes and there was really nothing to hold my attention.",

    "text": "John Wick 4 was released in theatres in 2023 and again stars Keanu Reeves in the title role killing his way through his enemies with style. Starring alongside Reeves is Bill Skarsgard as Marquis (bad guy), Donnie Yen, Lawrence Fishburne, Hirouki Sanada who I've liked since Last Samurai, and others. The movie is shot in different countries around the world and the fight scenes reflect these differing locations. There's not much to discuss with the plot as it's stayed the same for the last few movies. The Table, the shadowy organization that apparently controls the worlds crime families, wants John Wick dead and in turn Wick wants to \"kill them all\". There's lots of fight scenes, lots of shooting, chases, clever dialogue, interesting characters, and more dogs (who doesn't like attack dogs biting bad guys). But for me this has all been done in the previous three movies. A lot of this felt forced and didn't have the fun of the first two movies, which were my favorites. It was a good, not great, action movie but Reeves as usual was fun to watch. If you're a fan of the John Wick franchise, or just like action movies in general, then this is definitely for you.",
