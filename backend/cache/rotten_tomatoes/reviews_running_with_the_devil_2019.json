    "text": "Awful awful movie with some actors I used to like.  Unbelievable timeline of cocaine being transported from its source near the Columbian/Bolivian border  across the Gulf of Mexico,  through Mexico, through the States (California, Nevada, Idaho, Washington and then, with Skidoos (in the summer) to British Columbia.  Another USA slap to Canada re: drugs and being inept at law enforcement.  Give me (and Canada!) a break.  The last scene where an FBI Agent in charge murders Nicolas Cage is so ridiculous that my spelling out the stupid ending should do YOU a great favour\u2014 skip this one!",

Could have been written with more coherence and direction, cinematography is good but seems half heartedly directed. Such a great cast, all that talent could have been better utilized. A lot seemingly unconnected events happening, which makes story sometimes feels convoluted.",

    "text": "It's not a blatant caricature of the cocaine trade. But it falls short on nuance and acting and the ending feels rushed. Both Fishburne and Cage deliver watered down performances and they were as good as it got. Mediocre directing and predictable script missed a chance of a much better portrayal of the deadly and costly drug war. Watch it with low expectations and you might enjoy it. Just keep in mind that it barely scratches the surface.",

    "text": "It was so interesting how this story is told and how the characters ultimately converge. I could do with a little less of the vulgar sex scenes with Laurence Fishburne (great actor) which is why I gave it 4 stars, but you can always FF through that. Don't trust all these negative reviews. It was so cool to see the map graphic from time to time in the movie to see how the drugs travel and how the cost goes up with each stop. Just try watching it. Unique, cool movie with all great actors to support the plot.",

Nic Cage feels wasted as a serious top level drug runner who's only role is really to test drugs along the chain of custody.",

    "text": "A very understated story following the trafficking of cocaine into America from various viewpoints.  The disjointed storytelling style and big stars elevate it a bit, but it is slow going and doesn't really go anywhere or do anything interesting.  The short run time, semi-realistic take on affairs and subject matter holds your interest, but it doesn't build up much tension and the ending was very anticlimactic.",

A good cast of veteran and rising stars should cue folks that is a film worthy of Nicholas Cage rather than just one of his paycheck flix. Takes about 5 minutes to make that this ain't that. For those who ignored this film just because... suspend your assumptions and check it out.  You'll be glad. For those expecting the predictable schlock, you're right to be disappointed; this movie wasn't made for you.",
