    "text": "Black Adam arrives with the weight of Dwayne Johnson\u2019s passion project status, but instead of redefining a comic-book icon, it becomes a cinematic low point for the actor. Johnson pushed tirelessly to bring this character to life, promising an experience that would reshape the DC universe, yet the final product delivers little more than disappointment. What was marketed as a bold, game-changing superhero event feels instead like a hollow attempt at spectacle.\n\nThe promotional campaign framed the film as something extraordinary\u2014an over-the-top, once-in-a-lifetime performance from Johnson. But when the lights dim and the movie begins, it becomes clear how far Black Adam falls from those expectations. The shift from hype to reality is jarring, and not in the way an ambitious blockbuster hopes for. If anything, the film becomes a reminder that marketing alone cannot salvage weak execution.\n\nDirectorially, the movie never finds its footing. Rather than embracing the standards of strong character work, narrative momentum, and world-building that modern superhero films rely on, the direction feels aimless. Scenes that should heighten tension or emotion instead flatten out, leaving viewers detached from the story and its characters. It\u2019s as if the film is constantly chasing an identity it never fully claims.\n\nThe screenplay is by far the film\u2019s most glaring flaw. Structurally messy, thematically thin, and emotionally vacant, it never provides the foundation that Johnson\u2014or the filmmakers\u2014needed. Instead of building a compelling arc for its antihero, the script collapses step by step, unraveling in real time as the audience watches. Dialogue often lands with a thud, and attempts at depth come across as forced rather than earned.\n\nAs the story progresses, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense that the movie is crumbling under its own ambitions. Black Adam tries to juggle lore, mythology, world politics, and franchise setup, but never develops any of these elements in a meaningful way. The result is a film that feels both overloaded and underwritten, unable to bring coherence or excitement to its sprawling narrative.\n\nIn the end, Black Adam never steps into the cinematic spotlight it so desperately aims for. Instead, it becomes a cautionary tale about the gap between ambition and execution. From beginning to end, the film struggles to find purpose, creativity, or emotional resonance. Rather than elevating Johnson\u2019s superhero aspirations, it leaves behind little more than the memory of a misfire that could have\u2014and should have\u2014been so much more.",

    "text": "I enjoyed this superhero movie. It has some funny moments and the main character Black Adam is a somewhat conflicted character that evolves. It\u2019s not a deep character and not great acting. But it is superhero movie that is fun to watch! The visuals are amazing and I like all the heroes. The final villain is okay. Not a lot to him really. I feel it was well done. More people prefer the Marvel movies opposed to DC, but it is exciting and it worth a watch and a rewatch.",

Black Adam fell short of captivating failing to carry a decent storyline with shoddy directing. The Rock maybe thought even HE could defeat Black Adam, his ego got in the way and it shows.",

    "text": "Black Adam review i love opening action kill scenes can\u2019t believe her own brother betrayed his sister just to get the crown I love this casting introduce other justice league members I love how fast pace this movie is I hate that Adam got tricked into killing him just so so this for the bad guy, it\u2019s turned into a demon champion to fight to take over the throne, but also have the same type of power as black Adam, so somebody can challenge him for the throne because he blamed him black Adam blamed himself that he killed on mine, but he really didn\u2019t and that\u2019s the one part that I hate is that it\u2019s almost like they want him to give up because he\u2019s a killer but then at the same time they realize that maybe sending him to sleep again to bury him to feel like it helps to protect the people, but he\u2019s really actually helping so he\u2019s almost like 5000 years ago. The gods made the mistake of trapping him because they thought he was a killer, but in reality, he was seeking justice for his son, so this thing was more of a complex. and more of a misunderstanding I love at the end they all came together to defeat demon champion action and fight scenes was amazing as marwan kenzari is amazing playing bad guy roles isis she was amazing mom and character. Her son was amazing Kent was amazing in Dwayne Johnson playing Black Adam. He was just born for this role. He did an amazing job like everything and it\u2019s like he even used like tears WWE background for this movie when it comes to the actions and the fight scenes and when it came to his character work, he really used really used his wrestling background for this role and how the way the movie ended it look like it could like make a sequel, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna get a sequel but how it ended it look like it would like it\u2019ll be amazing if we do get a sequel or if not get a sequel at least another black Adam follow up movie and JamE$ gun DC world to follow up this movie but if a movie it but if this movie doesn\u2019t get a sequel, it\u2019s it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s still amazing and enjoyable like I don\u2019t think this movie should be like a one and done movie. It\u2019s look like this movie should be a sequel, but but this is a very good movie. If it doesn\u2019t get a sequel it\u2019s OK but it\u2019s definitely worthy of a sequel the visual effects for this movie looks very beautiful and amazing like throughout this entire movie and then especially when it came to the fight scenes arri and red digital cinema cameras looks so amazing and beautiful \n5 star \n10 out 10 star \n100 out 100 star",

The movie is Much better than I thought it would be. Action Packed, Good story, Dwayne Johnson is Awesome in it, and honestly every actor does Very well. Its a great popcorn muncher and an over all good time. Hope there is a sequel one day.  If you like action, and tired of goody two shoes heroes, this one will be a nice change.",
