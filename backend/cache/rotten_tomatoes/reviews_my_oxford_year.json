    "text": "I note that many reviewers have dismissed this film as contrived, formulaic and lacking a believable story line. What they have seem to have forgotten is that this is a rom com tinged with tragedy - why would you expect it to be believable. That is not the point!\n\nI thought the film was well written and the script smart with some good messages for those of us willing to listen.\n\nAll I can assume is that a lot of reviewers are so jaded and world weary that they cannot enjoy a good romantic story when it is put in front of them which is a shame.\n\nThe locations definitely helped and the Oxford backgrounds provided a romantic backdrop against which the story unfolds.\n\nFor me this was a good, entertaining watch with a good cast and engaging leads. What's not to like? Quite a lot if you are a film critic with no sense of romance or place or time. For the rest of us I can recommend this delightful film which I thoroughly enjoyed.",

The writing being done by someone who clearly isn't from the UK really shows when someone uses, apparently without irony, 'the dogs bollocks' as well as the constant mention of crumpets, something most people don't often eat. And to cap it off it has a horribly depressing ending. Not something I'd recommend.",

You can physically SEE them acting so hard instead of embodying their roles. Do not waste your time with this childish garbage.",

When I got into the movie, I realized with the setting, being in Oxford being in England and the real believable cast sporting cast along with the beautiful actress. Sophia Carson, I was immediately sold on this film. I think you will enjoy this love story.",

Oh, but it makes sure to try to get our stereotypes done quickly - getting splashed from puddles, fish & chips where the American can't understand the english language, and a kebab after a night of drinking.\nThe overall storyline is guessable within the first five-ten minutes, new college girl from America falls in love with her Poetry Professor and has a quick over-the-top romance. I am writing this after an awful 40 minutes watched.",

I was so absolutely appalled at how much worse the movie was (you always expect this but it was SO much worse) that I had to look it up. Netflix says the movie is based on the book but I also read that the book is based on the screenplay, which makes more sense. Regardless, don\u2019t watch the movie.",
