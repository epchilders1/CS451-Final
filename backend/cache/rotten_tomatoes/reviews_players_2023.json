Well, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",

    "text": "Players - 6.5/10. This is a \"shrug\" film (a movie you won't remember or care for in the future). Though, its still a good enough watch and will pass the overall time you spend on it. Gina Rodriguez is charming and great here, and she lights up the screen every time she's in a scene. But Players reminds you so much of other better films, and that's its downfall of the film. Its funny enough and charming enough, with the vibe of the film and the camaraderie of the group is what makes the movie better than your run of the mill romcom. Its story is a bit cliched though, and you kinda know where it will end up going near the halfway point of the film. Players is another one of those Netflix romcoms that will be enjoyable enough and good enough to watch, though, you shouldn't expect anything genre changing here!",

He must have been asked to be in this to create audience views. Actors were good, but plot so immature, who acts like this not even teenagers surely?  Net flix does do some filler movies and this was one of them.",

Better named \"The Wingmen\", the main two twists that made me rate this a strong B+ is due to the writing and Gina's great acting. Not to downplay the great acting by the rest of the cast, but I recognize no one in this movie other than Gina. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced romp. If you like rom-coms, watch this! \u2764\ufe0f",
