I wouldn\u2019t have minded 30 more minutes of runtime to develop the storyline and supporting characters a bit more. I also really enjoyed the score and soundtrack.",

This one drags on for over half the movie before becoming too hyperbolically dystopian on every level.  Everything from the constant overcast sky, to the winter months,  everything dirty, even smelly fish and ultra evil bad guys contemplating doing horrible things to innocents just too dark, dark, dark. \nCould have used a lot more nuance but opted to take a meat cleaver to the entire movie rhetorically speaking.",

It could have dragged but it kept my attention so much that I didn't take my much needed nap. Most of the characters are underwritten, but that didn't bother me. May bother you.",

It kept me intrigued...\nThe darkness of this film with a kiss of sunshine from Adrien Brody's character. The struggle he goes through with the loss of his daughter ( his fault) is particularly hard to watch ( in a good way). Loved it! It will be my go to movie to add to the list.",

It had some good action when it finally got to it, but I came close to turning it off. It took way to long to get to the action. I would say skip it unless you have nothing else to watch. Nobody uses a gun? I don't think so.",

    "text": "Clean\" earns a commendable 3.5 stars, driven by Adrien Brody's stellar performance and a narrative that presents a more nuanced take on the action genre. Brody's portrayal adds a layer of depth to the film, elevating it beyond a conventional action movie. Drawing comparisons to the high-octane pace of \"John Wick,\" \"Clean\" distinguishes itself with a slower, more character-driven approach. This deliberate pacing allows for a richer exploration of the characters, creating a more immersive and engaging experience for the audience. In the end, \"Clean\" stands out as a compelling entry in the action genre, blending intense sequences with character depth.",

It could use a bit better \"polish\", but it was really good. Acting was surprisingly good too. I would give it more than 3.5 stars if the ending would have a bit more closure and clarity (it left me wanting to know more)",

I looked at it almost like a comic. The way it is set up with the big boss and the crooked streets. Very Gotham. \n\nThe acting was good if you ask me. It loses a star for cinematography though.",
