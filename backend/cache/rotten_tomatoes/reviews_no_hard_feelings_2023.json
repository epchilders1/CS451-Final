It made me cry a number of times starting at the piano \ud83c\udfb9 scene and I think the goofy comedy got it there by making everything that was silly and fun fall into place unexpectedly in a very sweet way. I rather like the ending, I've made up my own idea of what happened Spoiler Alert: She moves to Cali because she wants to show that the travel concerns to see eachother on a regular basis wasn't the real problem it was the lies in the truth of the real feelings being had, and they lived happily ever after, till the end of their day's.",

Great acting.\nIt was really funny & it just made me feel lots of emotions.\nI mean that's what movies are suppose to do right?\nIt was creative & actually I can't remember myself seeing the similar comedy, which means that you are not watching with the feeling that you already saw the entire movie and know where all of it's gonna go. That's the part that I love the most about this movie!",

It left me feeling really sad at the end when Maddie and Percy didn't end up together \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94. I think Maddie cared for Percy and loved him as a friend.",

It\u2019s an OK movie with several plot holes, but it has enough bright spots to at least keep you watching the first time through.\n\nJennifer Lawrence didn\u2019t really come off as a comedic actress in this film and the guy wasn\u2019t quite pathetic enough to really believe it. The whole driver of the plot gets lost as it\u2019s a typical pay to date scam that\u2019s been done 100 times.\n\nThis isn\u2019t anything I\u2019ll watch again, but I managed to make it all the way through without rolling my eyes hard enough to knock me out. That will have to do.",
