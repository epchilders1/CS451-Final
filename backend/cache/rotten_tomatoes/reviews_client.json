Coming from Falling Down just the year before The Client is a big step down for Schumacher, despite a cast that should be able to make any directorial ambitions come to life. It is in fact Sarandon's effort that makes me put up with cartoonish mobsters and a script that doesn't know where it's going.",

Great actors given a bad script with bad directing delivers a real dud. First half hour gets your attention, but by the end you feel really bad you wasted your time on this.",

    "text": "The Client, though not the best of the John Grisham books brought to the screen, wins on the levels of 1. The acting from all involved. Tommy Lee Jones delivers one of his Top 5 performances. His cocky and arrogant Reverend Roy is perfect for this story. Susan Sarandon is on point as always with her down to earth performance as a former alcoholic and a cheap but smart, talented lawyer. The late Brad Renfro gives a great performance as a first timer in a film loaded with talent. He able to keep up with them all.\n2. The story gets a bit melodramatic but the storyline mixes the mob and the courtroom together very well. Joel Schumacher does it once again after giving us The Lost Boys and St. Elmo's Fire and would eventually bring another Grisham book to life with A Time to Kill does his best with the script that was given to him. This is definitely a great watch and the dialogue is a joy to listen to. There are several scenes that I have played over many times but I will say that the first scene between Sarandon and Jones is one for the books. Have yourself a Grisham weekend and start with this one, then A Time to Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Rainmaker and finish it off with The Chamber.",

It's impressive to think that this was Brad Renfro's first film role, and he does a good job as the central character. Coming in at just under two hours, this adaptation captures the essence of the novel without including all the details.",
