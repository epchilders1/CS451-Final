It is basically just a movie about how a woman cheats on her husband with a guy who previously cheated on his wife and then somehow they are the heroes you should root for. Not worth it.",

Thats all I saw and that's what made it magic! \n\nI've seen this in real life, granted not an entire lifetime yet, but two souls madly in love who just can't quite make it. I know it's real and its heartbreaking.",

Even though she cheated on her husband that didn't really do anything it was just a loveless marriage and Callum turner is WORTH IT.  Their chemistry and the story was kept me entertained the whole time. i love it",

And then she tries to make out he's the bad guy because he hid the letters? She even tried to run away with his child! Her husband was treated horribly, if this was about a husband who cheated on a wife they didn't love, it wouldn't he portrayed in this way. We definitely wouldn't be celebrating their affair and gunning for them to be together!",

    "text": "The story is neither original nor riveting, heavily drawing inspiration from Bridges of Madison County. The rendering of the 60's is rather good, overall. The \"modern\" part is less interesting. The acting is nothing to write home about, especially from Shailene Woodley. There's nothing going on in her face, no emotion. And I didn't really buy into their love story. If you're a fan of romantic movies, like me, you'll be disappointed, but it's not a complete failure either, so... up to you.",

Heartbreaking miscommunication and missed timing that could really only happen in bygone times. I thought I'd leave the movie feeling \"meh\" but I DID cry at the end, which surprised me. It's a nice watch if you want something you know will be bittersweet satisfaction, but are ok with the writing not really pulling it all together.",

Shailene Woodley is stunning in her portrayal of a glamorous 60's politician's wife.  She possibly surpasses Elizabeth Taylor for raven haired ravishing ethereal beauty.  She manages to convey with her face and body what few actresses can pull off.  I felt what she felt.",
