And the actors are okay just their voice lines are so cringe. I don\u2019t know how the cgi\u2019s gotten worse from 2007 but put more time into making watchable movies! Please bring back the og transformer movies. Get Shia leaubouf back",

With Anthony Ramos\u2019s grounded lead performance, slick visuals, and a strong mix of old and new, it\u2019s one of the stronger entries in the series despite uneven pacing. A fun, crowd-pleasing blockbuster that keeps the Transformers saga rolling forward.",

I miss the old transformers movies with  their epic car to bot transformations and epic detail. To be honest, Optimus and bumble bee don\u2019t even look the same as the old ones. Flat movie, but yeah we gonna watch it anyway to stay up to date I guess :/",

The CGI for the Transformers was not as good as Michael Bay's movies (which is tragic to me, seeing as this film came out years after), but the visuals were still really good. Peter Cullen once again gave us an outstanding performance as Optimus Prime, and the Maximals are some of the best looking characters I've seen in the Transformers movies. Unicron is my favorite Transformers villain, and I think the movie did an amazing job portraying how menacing he is. I definitely recommend it for sci-fi and action fans, and of course for fans of the Transformers franchise!",

In addition, the introduction of Gi.Joe was completely unnecessary, and not what I think anyone was looking for. Not to mention that it seems to really contradict the plot of the earlier transformer movies that take place (chronologically) before this one.",
