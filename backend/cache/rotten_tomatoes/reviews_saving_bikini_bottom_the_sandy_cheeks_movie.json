It\u2019s chaotic, unhinged, and weirdly charming in the best way.\nThe real tragedy is that people aren\u2019t turning every scene into memes. Like\u2026 hello? How is the internet sleeping on this?",

    "text": "When I first heard about this movie, I was so excited for it to come out on August 2nd, 2024. If you are confused, the WHOLE movie got leaked on Twitter(X). Anyways, I saw this movie on the day it came out, me and my parents were on a trip to Canada, I was watching this on the way there and I gotta\u2019 say I was not impressed, but didn\u2019t HATE it. Things I like about the movie: decent animation, good acting, entertaining, I like the introduction to Sandy\u2019s family. Dislikes: plot was slow at times, too many characters, there were some unnecessary elements in there. That\u2019s all, by the way I LOVE SpongeBob, I have been watching it since I was 3.",
