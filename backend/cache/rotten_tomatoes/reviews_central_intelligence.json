I'd like to say that I had zero expectations going into this but was still looking forward to it. This movie is HILARIOUS! The Rock and Kevin Hart are fantastic together and have some of the funniest jokes I've heard all year. Watching them both on screen is the best part of this movie and it was extremely funny.",

La qu\u00edmica entre los protagonistas destaca, ofreciendo momentos hilarantes y una din\u00e1mica entra\u00f1able. Aunque no se aparta de los clich\u00e9s del g\u00e9nero, la pel\u00edcula se sostiene por el carisma de sus actores y una trama que mantiene el ritmo. Ideal para pasar un rato divertido sin demasiadas pretensiones.",
