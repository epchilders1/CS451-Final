Not a single joke lands, it just tries constantly to be so funny by making the same jokes again and again, and it\u2019s honestly disgusting. Absolutely atrocious, wouldn\u2019t have finished if I wasn\u2019t with friends.",

Es honestamente, un atentado contra los derechos de los animes, un manifiesto del odio a la humanidad y la nueva pelicula favorita de un grupo de personas muy repugnates cuyos nombres riman con zoo + filia. Esto no debio de existir.",

    "text": "I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. I had read plenty of negative reviews before watching it, but I completely disagree. Fixed entertained me from start to finish and gave me genuine laughs, something I hadn\u2019t gotten from other films in a while.\n\nThe humor worked for me because it connects with the way I see things: irreverent, direct, and a bit absurd. That\u2019s exactly why it felt fresh, different, and fun. I was really bored, not finding anything that could grab my attention, and Fixed ended up being exactly what I needed.\n\nI get that it\u2019s not for everyone, but for me it was refreshing to watch something new that dares to be different. Honestly, it feels like this movie could\u2019ve been made by me \u2014 it has my sense of humor written all over it. That\u2019s why it absolutely deserves five full stars.",

    "text": "'Fixed' is, to barely any surprise (well, so I thought), utter tripe. It's somehow worse than 2023's 'Strays', which is the one impressive thing about this 2025 movie. These 'adult animated' films always fascinate me, like who the heck are they for? It's teenage humour for... grown adults?!\n\nGrossed out humour can exist, but I wished they'd stop stooping to the bottom of the barrel every single time... poop and sex gags, that's all they're capable of apparently - even when dogs are involved, evidently. Every inch of this film is just mind-numbingly stupid.\n\nListen, I'm fully aware that I only have myself to blame. Despite knowing nothing major about it, the tiny knowledge I did hold made me know what I was about to watch. Yet I still chose to watch it, hoping one day one of these 'adult animated' releases will be worthwhile...\n\nZero creativity here, proper lazy stuff. I simply cannot compute that people actually sat around and wrote this... they live amongst us, which is a scary thought! Those voices onscreen aren't much better, Idris Elba is the only one who is minorly OK (hearing him f-bomb is minimally amusing).\n\nYou can have all this gross comedy, but at least surround it with a plot that's somewhat coherent and interesting; the gags should be part of the film, not it entirely. Lastly... gotta feel for Andrea Bocelli - they really be letting anyone use his music, huh?\n\nI've not checked how this has been received yet... surely not any better than from yours truly? checks y'all too kind. If you like this then fair enough, I guess. One of the worst movies I've seen, personally.",

Also they try to make it seem like we should accept bull getting castrated even though the whole movie comes acrossed as a commentary against castration. They had a good concept but the writing ruined it.",

    "text": "Comedic in ways often unexplored, this film has an interesting storyline, often visually provocative scenes, and a well-adapted style of anthropomorphizing the actions of animals with a comical twist on reality. It does use excessive fiction and conveniently timed events which can make it seem inauthentic, but also can be a relief from the sexual-oriented storyline.",
