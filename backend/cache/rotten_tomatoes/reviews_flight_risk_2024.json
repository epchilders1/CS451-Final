Nobody seemed to even bother to lookup how airplanes work, and 99% of the film takes place in an airplane.\nThey couldn't even bother to film a truck in front of a motel, it was all cgi. And the cg was not even high school quality.",

Lots of twists, good performances, nice ending, and thank goodness it's just 90 minutes. Can we have more shorter movies, please?",

I've always liked Marky Mark but he's much better as a good guy. Topher Grace was exceptional in this, especially the last 35 minutes or so. The ending was amazing with a couple twists. Give it a look, ignore the experts.",

It looked like they even used CGI for simple scenes like a car parked in a snowy lot.  The dialog says the plane is at 1000 feet, but the scene shows it at 30 feet. The dialog says the plane is out of fuel and the engines have stopped, but then they land the plane and show the engines running at high power. This is a Mel Gibson movie? Mel, please, you directed this one on a Zoom call.",

The plot is rice paper thin, the writing is dreck, and that plane would have folded like a paper napkin when it struck the ridge. \n\nAwful, predictable, stupid film.",
