    "text": "Such a disappointment.  Eddie Murphy was da bomb, the king of entertainment for a period of time until he bombed taking on awful scripts and projects. This documentary is a vanity project presenting Eddie without any insights on his failures or his personal challenges.  What made the documentary worse, beyond the effusive praise of when was da bomb, is what comes across as Eddie\u2019s humongous ego.  Eddie Murphy may have more talent than (all??) others - we can debate that - but there\u2019s no debate for his lack of humbleness, which turned my stomach.",

As one of the best comedians of his generation and an actor that shaped my childhood, I was looking forward to hearing about what inspires him as an artist and his legacy in the industry. Being Eddie is just two hours of Murphy talking about himself in a one-dimensional way.",

Great to watch.  Love the Richard Pryor references.  Hate that anyone could ever be called \"the new Richard Pryor\", because\u2026 Richard Fricken Pryor!   But Eddie Murphy is also very funny and talented.   Just ask him lol. \nI would just rather hear that from fans, rather than Eddie himself.  Over and over again.. did you know Eddie Murphy Credits himself for Denzel Washington and Morgan Feemans careers?  Yup.\nIt actually gets kinda gross at some point.  Ego Murphy..",

There is no mention of any of the controversies it's just all fluff, so you only ever get half the person. After a while it's a bit grating and synthetic. I don't know if that's his fault for not filtering his own ego or the directors fault for steering away from difficult questions but the end result is another puff piece that is a bit dull.",

    "text": "- Suzie Q. \n\nThis Netflix documentary  \"Being Eddie\"   is an outstanding one. It starts from his early years before fame, and then it takes you through his entire career. There are a lot of things that you will learn about him that you didn\u2019t know. There are things that the industry does to cause friction between fellow actors and comedians. Eddie is a very talented individual, from acting, writing, directing, and his musical talent is also amazing! \n\nThis documentary brought light to the darkness of the industry, the way that they play black actors against each other, or at least they try to. There are clippings of Richard Pryor being asked, how did he feel about Eddie becoming the next Richard Pryor. Why was a question like that ever asked? It was as if they had to erase one to praise another, which is never cool. Arsenio Hall commented on that and made it very clear that no one ever asks white actors about being replaced with other actors. It\u2019s as if there can only be one black entertainer per industry.\n\nThis documentary reflects the personal side of Eddie, it shows him as the person he is behind the stage, behind the scenes. The documentary shows how he has been purposely overlooked to receive an Oscar, which I feel personally that he should\u2019ve received one for Dolemite Is My Name, Mr. Church, and Dream Girls. It doesn\u2019t take away his brilliance, it doesn\u2019t take away his phenomenal genius. The documentary also reflects on the pain that he endured while Saturday Night Live, the show that he literally brought life to, made fun of him, calling him a fallen star. How dare they! Garrett Morris was simply known as \"The Black Guy\" on Saturday Night Live. No other actor brought what Eddie Murphy brought to the show whether black or white. Eddie Murphy was the only reason people tuned in to watch Saturday Night Live every Saturday night\u2026 Period.\n\nHe reinvented characters and real life entertainers, such as Buckwheat, Gumby, Mr. Robinson\u2019s Neighborhood (His version of Fred Rogers), James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Velvet Jones, Richard Simmons, and the list goes on. None other has brought this kind of talent to the stage, Eddie Murphy is simply gifted. It was something special about everything that he did on SNL, and the fact that what he brought to us was never done before in the way that this mastermind brought to us through his performances. He\u2019s made us laugh, he amazed us, he brought millions upon millions to their T.V.\u2019s on Saturday nights. He never let us down, he scored every single time! And, that is what brought viewers to SNL, it was truly The Eddie Murphy Show. After he left SNL the viewers dwindled, they never had as many viewers as it had when Eddie was on the show. Facts. He still continues to amaze us over four decades of excellence. \n\nThere may have been a few flukes along the way, but they could not erase what Eddie has already given us. There are many entertainers that have had flukes, or made bad choices in productions, but that in no way can define one's sagacity such as Eddie Murphy. Today people still make references to his movies and his comedy even as far back as the early \u201880\u2019s to current. He spoke of the loss of his brother, Charlie Murphy, who was an awesome entertainer and comedian. He didn\u2019t linger on the subject, but he did speak on it. As we all know, it\u2019s not easy to lose a loved one, and it\u2019s extremely hard on others that they cannot dwell on the subject regarding a lost loved one, because it can truly take you to a very dark place. It was visible that he was hurting within while discussing Charlie.\n\nThe documentary briefly reflected on his children, all ten of them. The documentary did not focus on his marriage with Nicole, nor the divorce from her, it generally focused on him and his career, rightfully so. There were various actors, comedians and entertainers commenting on topics regarding Eddie\u2019s career. Although Eddie Murphy is widely known internationally, in my opinion he should be recognized far more than he is. What I love best about him, is that he knows when the industry tries to throw digs at him, but he overlooks the impertinence of their gestures, and he keeps moving forward.  Such a stupendous one he is.",
