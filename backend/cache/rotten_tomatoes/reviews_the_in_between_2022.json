    "text": "The story tried to give a unique setting and deliver an intriguing love story. But I saw it to be repetitive. The western romantic movies have not deviated away from having almost similar protagonists with consistent kissing and making out scenes. Anyway, I was able to watch all of it by being busy with other things at the same time.",

    "text": "The In Between ist ein Liebesfilm von Arie Posin (Regie), das Drehbuch stammt von Marc Klein. Die Geschichte handelt von einer ersten Liebe, ja Liebe und Verlust das sind die Themen\u2026 . Joey King und Kyle Allen spielen ihre Hauptrollen voll \u00fcberzeugend und glaubw\u00fcrdig\u2026 .  Die Farbbearbeitung von \u201eThe In Between\" ist gro\u00dfartig und erzeugt eine gewisse Mystik\u2026 . Die Musikalische Gestaltung von JJ Pfeifer ist voll ausgereift und l\u00e4dt uns Mitf\u00fchlen ein, von Songs bis zum klassischen Klaviersolo. Ja alles passt zusammen, f\u00fcr mich ist \u201eThe In Between\" ein perfekter Liebesfilm mit einer gewissen Mystik.",

I forced myself to sit through the movie but even the end is bad, I just can't find anything nice to say about it. Pure waste of time.",
