    "text": "Watched it for Anna cause I loved her YT channel and was excited to see her act but this was not the role for her. She is not an action star. Storyline sucked. The era shift was a bad call. Magic wasn\u2019t everywhere in the first movie but this one had just enough shitty sfx to give the illusion of being in the same world but still fails at it somehow. A lot of the characters were written extremely horribly and mostly all characters are unlikable. Forced myself through half the movie and then tapped out. Also the costume for Anna made her looked bowlegged and the fact that they gave her knee pads through the whole movie only highlighted that and it bothered me deeply lol. Fire the costume dept",

Storyline was focused on just killing but not as well executed as John Wick. I get that it was taking into consideration the modern setting but they should have let the 47 Ronin a classic as it is. Just got through the movie for the sake of the latter",
