    "text": "Sniper: Assassin's End \u2013 A Cinematic Disaster....\n\nAssassin's End is like enduring a slow, painful cinematic lobotomy. The plot is so uninspired and nonsensical that it feels like it was cobbled together by brain-dead interns on a caffeine crash. The acting? A masterclass in wooden performances and awkward line delivery that makes even the most generic B-movies look like Oscar contenders.\n\nFrom start to finish, the film manages to insult the viewer\u2019s intelligence with every predictable twist, lifeless action scene, and cringeworthy dialogue. It\u2019s the kind of movie that actively angers you while watching \u2013 a rare feat of filmmaking incompetence. If you find any joy in this mess, you might as well sign up for a lifetime of peeling potatoes, because critical thinking clearly isn't your strong suit.\n\nAvoid at all costs.",

    "text": "This movie is just your standard assassin flick, offering nothing new or thrilling. It completely fell flat, feeling like a rehash of countless films we've seen before. \"Sniper Assassins End\" was simply a dull and uninspired take on the genre.\n\nThe plot was basic, with an ending that felt like a generic copy-and-paste from any other movie\u2014lacking any real depth. The acting was mediocre at best, leading to a sense of utter boredom. Watching this film was so unengaging that I felt it was easy to just tune out.\n\nI started it hoping for something entertaining, but honestly, it ended up being more of a background distraction while I played on my phone.",

One dimensional villains. It has enough to keep your attention and a couple of the sniper scenes are pretty cool but in the end you wish there was less talk and more sniping.",
