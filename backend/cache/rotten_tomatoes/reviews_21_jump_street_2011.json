    "text": "This proves that not all reboots are doomed.\n\nInstead of trying to copy the original, it flips the concept into a self-aware, fast-paced comedy that pokes fun at buddy cop clich\u00e9s, high school stereotypes, and itself. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum\u2019s chemistry is the heart of the film.. Hill brings sharp wit while Tatum surprises with strong comedic timing. Add Ice Cube\u2019s perfectly intimidating (yet hilarious) captain and a clever script full of relentless jokes, and you\u2019ve got a comedy that doesn\u2019t just work.. it thrives. It may not be a deep story, but it delivers exactly what it promises: smartly stupid fun that still holds up years later.",

There really is a special place in my heart for 21 Jump Street. I wasn't sure when I watched it if I would find it very funny, but it shocked me by being absolutely hilarious!",

    "text": "This is a comedy made by people who got the joke. This kind of derivative movie based on an old TV show can easily be predictable and boring. Instead, Ice Cube brought it all together poking fun at the premise immediately. The characters are silly, but the movie is good with breaking the 4th wall, and making fun of itself. From the other cops, the teachers, the other students, and the plot regarding the drugs; everything was dumb, but in the best kind of fun way.\n\nOverall, this is a movie I can watch every few years and laugh along with and at the whole way through.",
