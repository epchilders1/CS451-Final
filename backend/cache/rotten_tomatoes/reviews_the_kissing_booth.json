    "text": "The kissing booth is a rom-com directed by Vince Marcello in 2018 \nthe lead actors other than her are Joey King place the r\u00f4le of Ella Evans y Jacob Elordi place the role of Noah Flynn and Joel Courtney place the role of Lee Flynn \nIt's the story of two brothers, one of whom has had a best friend since birth the other is a bad boy but falls in love with the best friend in question \nNoah flynn y Ella Evans live their love story behind the back of Lee Flynn but this brings them problems\n\nI think it's a good film mixing love and comedy. The actors play quite well despite their great ages for their roles as teenagers.\n\nThe sets are pretty good except in some shots where the green background is too present. \n\nFinally, this film is cool to watch to spend a funny and exciting time",

They blamed the love interest for what the main female character was responsible for? WTF? Did I miss why everyone hated the love interest as well? I mean, sure, maybe they didn't think he was right for her, I get that, but they all seemed to actively DISLIKE him. EVERYONE in the mc's life hated him. I didn't get that at all.",

I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, this is what i imagine to be 9 year old girl gold.Absolutely horrific. Visualise all the bad preteen high school movies and put them in one and poof you have created the kissing booth. Tbf it was a good laugh.",
