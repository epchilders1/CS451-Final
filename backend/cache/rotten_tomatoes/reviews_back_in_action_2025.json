The movie however was very safe, somewhat funny, it's good for a family watch with kids.\nJamie & Cameron are playing as spies that retired and decided to build a family and completely change their lives by cutting off their connections with CIA, that thought that they died during the last mission. But one day they got uncovered and that's when the trouble just knocked on their door. They went back in action and forcibly told their kids about their past that they sacrificed for raising them.",

    "text": "My goodness this was dire. I wasn't expecting Fight Club, or The French Connection, but a silly piece of action fluff to pass an evening. What I got was painful to watch. Credit where it's due, I guess it takes a special level of craftsmanship to make this many bike, boat and car chases, and shoot outs boring but they did a great job of achieving that. The script was bad fan fiction of one of Arnie's lesser movies. Throw in a comic relief character who was as funny as a piece of broken glass in your shoe, and we couldn't finish it. Do your self a favour. Don't.",

    "text": "Otra entrega de ex esp\u00edas con familia que tienen que volver a la accion para el disfrute del publico en el streaming de turno, en este caso con Jamie Foxx y Cameron Diaz. Rendidora, tiene buen ritmo y aunque la historia ya se hizo varias veces cumple. Falla mucho en el humor, por momentos es muy bobo e inocente. La escenas de peleas y persecuciones es lo mejorcito que ofrece (y menos mal porque es lo que uno busca ver).",

The spy storyline kept things exciting, and the humor made it so much fun to watch. Nigel was one of my absolute favorite characters\u2014he brought so much personality to every scene. This is definitely a movie my family and I will be watching on repeat!",

    "text": "I have watched this movie twice since it has been released. It very much so gives \u2018Spy\u2019 (Melissa McCarthy) vibes as well as \u2018The Family Plan\u2019 (Mark Wahlberg). Getting the return of Diaz and Foxx separately was so thrilling, let alone the return of them together. Their chemistry in this picture was nothing short of comedic and genuine excitement. I\u2019m not too sure why some audiences do not have a liking toward this genre of film anymore, as this style is the epitome of what the peak of Action Comedy was and is. \n\nIt is not meant to be a film where you are strictly given gruesome action scenes, rather it is to give a sense of thrill and wonder paired with a light hearted smile (which it did so very well). I enjoyed every moment of this picture, and would recommend to any group of people, including family audiences.",
