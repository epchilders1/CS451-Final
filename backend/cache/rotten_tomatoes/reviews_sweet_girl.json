    "text": "Boring.  And I love JM!!  But this, was boring.  Poor acting, on pretty much everyone's part.  And the dialogue?  Thumbs down.  Casting for the daughter Rachel was wrong.  Even though other reviews say the chemistry between JM and Rachel was good, I disagree.  I suffered through the whole movie to the end simply because I had already invested so much time in it.  I hate to say it, but I couldn't wait for it to end.  Disappointed.  But JM was AWESOME in Game of Thrones!!",

    "text": "Sweet Girl - 4/10. Brian Andrew Mendoza debuts with a clunky whimper of an action film. Starring Jason Momoa and Isabela Merced, who happen to be the only good things about the movie, star as a father and daughter team who seek out to get justice against a pharmaceutical company. Along the way, they dive deep into a corrupt system, finding out evil truths. What could have been an interesting film turns out to be a highly missed opportunity. And with an unbelievable (in a bad way) plot twist, the movie veers towards cliche and tried and tired tropes. Spoilers for anyone who will want to see the film, but the plot twist makes for a ridiculous reveal. If the story had revolved around the daughter from the beginning, this might have ended up being an interesting film. However, you get invested in the father, and it all goes down the drain with that twist. Its like baking a birthday cake and having it turn out to be a pumpkin pie. You expect one thing and you get something else in return. The film has great acting from the lead duo, who help bring the film out of gutter with convincing performances. The action is somewhat decent, though a little hard to see due to shoddy camera work. All in all, another failed star vehicle from Netflix.",

Who did all of the killing? Was it a dream? Did he die at the beginning? The ending completely lost me. Do not watch this movie, for you will be angry at the end. Utter stupidity!!!! It was really good until the end. Then she didn't even do the right thing!!!!! Kill them all.",

Careless, idiotic, and huge gaping plot holes. A skinny and tiny 18 year old girl, that would have trouble lifting a chopstick, easily kills at least 5 trained assassins....etc. blah blah blah. Terrible acting and really lame action sequences. Very stupid and unrealistic ending. Overall, this is one of the dumbest and lamest movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.",
