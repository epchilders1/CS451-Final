I\u2019m assuming the low rating is due to the age of reviewers but if you are Gen X or older, then don\u2019t let the average rating put you off.  I would give this a solid 3.5 with extra .5 for keeping close to a 90 min run time.",

I hoped for a wistful, steamy, feel good romance in a beautiful setting (and honestly my standards are low, I\u2019m easily pleased) but instead, it was boring, predictable, and entirely lacking in chemistry. I found Liam Hemsworth\u2019s character deeply unlikeable - the mopey coal mining finance bro who broke up with his girlfriend for cheating on him the same night he tried to cheat on her didn\u2019t charm me I\u2019m afraid. The singular sex scene was dull. The pace was stilted, like a poor book adaptation. The acting was fine. Giving it 2 stars because it was at least visually beautiful to watch.",

    "text": "I gave this a higher rating than it deserves because I want the industry to keep making movies like this. But I went in knowing (after reading reviews) that it was just two normal people talking in a beautiful setting and of course the predictable outcome. But really is it terrible to watch a Hemsworth for an hour and a half...my answer is no.  :) I did agree with the lack of chemistry but they can't just cast Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, or Nicole Kidman for everything, so knowing what I was getting into I enjoyed it. Again just like that Netflix is doing movies that aren't really a thing in the industry so I'll support it and hope to heck they get better at it!!",

My eyes can\u2019t just tolerate the hot scenes between the two lead actors because of the physically obvious age difference. (But no judgement here) it\u2019s just the hot scenes can be skipped, we already understand he needs a motherly care in the story. The lesson indeed was heard.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve never been a Laura Dern fan, and this film did nothing to change my mind. She now sports the predictable pillow face of aging actresses in Hollywood, which often replaces once-good acting technique. She has zero chemistry with Liam Hemsworth, who was the one bright spot in this tale of narcissistic women. The May-December relationship was just not believable and the movie fell flat. A Diane Lane or an Annette Benning could have pulled this off. Waste of a good-looking and charming Hemsworth.",

Plus the scenery in Morocco is beautiful.  However, the premise is ridiculous (a young hunk finance guy breaks up with his cute writer girlfriend while on a trip and immediately runs to the arms of an older, reclusive writer).  The dialogue is like that of a bad soap opera, and there is zero chemistry between the lead characters.",

Our planet would be very lonely if this was the best it could muster. Generally, I think the result is often bad when a writer is writing a movie largely centered around the plot of writing. There's a scene (not really a SPOILER...) where a thief steals Laura Dern's computer and novel she's working on. To that thief I'd like to say \"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! Otherwise, we could have been looking at a possible sequel...\n\nAs I've often said in my reviews, who finances this? Who reads this script and decides, \"yeah, let's make this.\"",
