    "text": "Venom: The Last Dance was the cinematic equivalent of a stalemate \u2013 it didn't particularly impress or disappoint. While it had some neat visuals, the overall experience felt like more of the same old Venom shtick, with a forced Spider-Man: No Way Home tie-in that only served to whet fans' appetites without delivering any real substance. Typical Sony.\n\nGrading: C-",

    "text": "Venom: The Last Dance delivers energetic chaos but falters with a cluttered, unfocused narrative that dims its trilogy-ending potential. While Tom Hardy\u2019s Eddie-Venom duo sparkles with humor, the script overloads with disjointed subplots\u2014blackmail, betrayals, alien swarms\u2014that muddy the stakes. Pacing stumbles in a sluggish second act, and supporting characters like Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s Strickland and Juno Temple\u2019s Paine feel like afterthoughts, lacking depth. Andy Serkis\u2019s Knull, despite cosmic promise, is undercooked, and the rushed climax fails to land. Compared to Let There Be Carnage\u2019s lean thrills, this 2024 finale sacrifices coherence for spectacle, missing a chance to elevate the symbiote saga into something truly epic.",

I'm not a fan of the comic character and this film didn't improve that opinion.  It's watchable even though it does abandon it's own logic.",
