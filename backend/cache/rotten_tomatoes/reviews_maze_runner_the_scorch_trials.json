However, the superficial and expository dialogues take away much of the scene's emotional weight.\n\nThe chase scenes are very well shot, while the action sequences fall short.\n\nI found the contrast between the first and second film quite fascinating - the first focuses on a confined setting and a group of survivors trying to escape, while the second turns into more of a zombie movie, with generic cinematography and makeup, yet featuring a story that stands out from other zombie films.",

All I want to know is why the maze was important, but the coolest part of the trilogy\u2014the maze\u2014isn\u2019t in this movie.\n\nOther than that, terrible score, poor writing and acting, cheesy lines, but hey, at least the zombies are kinda cool?\n\nI\u2019m only watching this to get to the third movie. Hopefully that one is better than this.",

    "text": "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is an ambitious sequel that successfully carries forward the momentum of the first film while expanding the scope of its dystopian universe. Picking up right where The Maze Runner left off, this installment dives headfirst into a world ravaged by chaos, where survival is no longer about escaping a maze\u2014it\u2019s about outlasting a collapsing society. The movie manages to maintain tension, intrigue, and action while introducing new layers to the ongoing mystery behind WCKD and the infected world outside.\n\nDirector Wes Ball deserves credit for keeping the energy high and the pacing tight. The film wastes no time plunging its characters into peril, delivering set piece after set piece filled with chase sequences, explosions, and moments of pure adrenaline. While some critics dismissed the sequel as overly chaotic, it actually thrives on its unpredictability. Each environment\u2014from the desolate urban ruins to the eerie desert wastelands\u2014feels alive and dangerous, reinforcing the idea that the world itself has become the maze.\n\nDylan O\u2019Brien continues to shine as Thomas, bringing both strength and vulnerability to his performance. His determination to uncover the truth about WCKD gives the story its heart, grounding all the spectacle in genuine emotional stakes. The chemistry among the cast remains one of the film\u2019s greatest strengths, especially between O\u2019Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster\u2019s Newt. Their bond feels authentic and adds depth to the ensemble dynamic.\n\nWhile the screenplay doesn\u2019t always hit every emotional note as cleanly as it could, it still offers solid structure and purpose. The dialogue is serviceable, if not particularly memorable, but the world-building is strong enough to compensate. What truly holds the film back is not its content but its marketing. The Scorch Trials deserved a larger cultural footprint than it received. It\u2019s a sequel that should have cemented the franchise\u2019s place alongside The Hunger Games or Divergent, but poor promotion left it underappreciated by mainstream audiences.\n\nThere\u2019s also an impressive balance between action and mystery here. The infected \u201cCranks\u201d introduce a horror element that blends seamlessly with the series\u2019 sci-fi roots, and the cinematography captures both the dread and desolation of a dying world. This tonal shift makes the film darker and grittier than its predecessor, which works in its favor\u2014it\u2019s no longer just a puzzle, it\u2019s a fight for humanity.\n\nUltimately, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a strong continuation that proves the franchise had far more to offer than it was ever given credit for. It\u2019s not a perfect sequel, but it\u2019s a gripping, well-directed, and visually striking one. The film\u2019s biggest failure lies not in its storytelling, but in the lack of recognition it received. For fans of dystopian action with heart and grit, this remains one of the most underrated entries of its genre.",

    "text": "The story makes perfect sense and isn't hard to follow at all. In that regard it expands on the world and all just fine. The biggest problem here is there is pretty much 0.00% character expansion. As simple as Thomas hero arc was it still was something along with basic enough arcs for the other kids as a whole. This has almost none of that. there the same as when they started for the most part. Save for the girl which comes out of nowhere. The result is an adventure that feels like mindless sort of action at points throughout. It follows a logical flow but it just feels a bit much. The music and cinematography isn't bad. It's not bad direction wise but the new settings all feel like places weve seen in other films. Oblivion, Mad Max, The Hunger Games, even Fallout games. It doesn't have that same distinction the maze did. The zombies also kind of come out of nowhere and don't even feel like they fit the movie honestly. It feels like I Am Legend or dawn of the dead remake type stuff. Everything else is just alright about it. The whole zombie part with Winston and all could've been cut because that doesn't really even contribute anything to the plot. It starts out pretty good honestly in the facility with lots of action, cool ideas, and it's just well done honestly and you think it's gonna be better than the first. But it just keeps going with action and no character development of any kind. The kids all blend in terribly because of it. Than once Harriet shows up and her and Tom become the main focus it just really takes a dive. We just abandon the main group, get more zombies, and are given hardly any reason to care or like her as the new replacement. Same with Tom who basically gets no development at all. Than the kids come back and we get to the actual rebel group and the betrayal, the enzymes, and setting up for the Mockingjay style conclusion. It kind of feels like everything in the middle was just filler honestly looking back. I mean if your a die hard fan of these kind of novels/sub genre than knock yourself out here I guess. But most could skip it. It's dissappointing because the new locales, new action, ideas all should blow away the first and yet without any character expansion, not setting up new ones well, settings that don't set themselves apart enough, ideas that don't fit, and a script that's got too much action just weigh it down.",
