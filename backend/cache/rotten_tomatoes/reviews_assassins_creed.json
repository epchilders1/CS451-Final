You have to watch it and decide for yourselves. Sometimes critics being over critical about a movie is like cutting a sapling cause its giving no value at that point of time and we miss out on a tree that gives many values someday. \nWatch and decide for yourselves.",

    "text": "For a film made from a computer game, it started pretty strongly - and went well up to about 2/3 of the way through. The \"Apple of Eden contains the key to free will\" plotline was always total bollocks, but the action sequences and some sub-plots (father/son, father/daughter, potential being realised) were not bad. Then the ending was so gob-smackingly awful: the assassins... assassinated everyone in about 2 minutes and the film just ended. Game over.",

    "text": "I think this movie got more hate than it deserved. It had an interesting storyline that aligned with the video games (story-wise), even though Templars vs Assassins isn't hard to emulate. It practically could have been a Desmond Miles story, if he was related to a Spanish Assassin. The movie definitely had a Brotherhood or Unity feel to it, with Cal being surrounded by Assassin's either in the past or at the Abstergo building.\n\nThe actors did an excellent job stepping into their roles. The characters were fleshed out and Cal had good character development over the course of the movie. I will say, Marion/Sofia didn't need to stand next to the Animus the whole time like a cheerleader \"oh, do it. jump. roll.\" It was awkward to watch and again, gave nothing to the story. We could take those parts out and nothing would change, or we could just have her debrief Cal after he exits the Animus for the same effect. \n\nBut, with every good, there must be bad. There wasn't much of a reason to make the Animus into a giant claw. It was purely there for aesthetics, because the video game does perfectly well integrating the Bleeding Effect without having to watch the present-day character act everything out. It looked cool for aesthetics, but was pointless for the story. \nAt times, it seemed as if the characters were mumbling, which doesn't add to the story at all. Such as, in the end, the last time we see Aguilar is when he stares at the ceiling and mumbles under his breath with no translation. \n\nOverall, I give the movie 4/5 stars. I would like to see another Assassin's Creed game that overall aligns more closely to the games or if they made a sequel and used the feedback to make it better.",
