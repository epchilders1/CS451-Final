    "text": "Four Brothers nails it\u2019s blend of dramatic tension and slick thrills, thanks in large part to its popular lead cast. The film's exploration of each character's complex past and bad-boy persona add depth to the film, making it a compelling watch. However, the ending may not resonate with everyone due to certain plot developments.\n\nGrading: B+",

    "text": "This somehow being a \"reboot\" of 'The Sons of Katie Elder' is wild to me. However, this is a pretty good action flick. The four adoptive brothers have a strong love and bond with their adoptive mother who gets murdered. So this is through and through a pretty great revenge story with some nice action sequences. Mark Wahlberg is Mark Wahlberg and does a good enough job. Having some Hip-Hop/R&B stars like Tyrese Gibson, and Andr\u00e9 3000 as some of the brothers is actually a nice touch in this. Especially since Marky Mark was a thing. So it leaves me going, who is Garrett Hedlund? The fourth brother?",

The Movie Is About Their Mom Getting Killed By Two Store Gunmen And Bobby , Jeremiah , Angel And Jack Going Back To Detroit And Finding Their Killers They Eventually Do But More Problems Arise. The Movie Is Super Fun To Watch And It Makes You Feel Like Your Part Of Their Squad And Like I Said At The Beginning It Hits Home As I Grew Up In Part Just Like Detroit But Just Football/Soccer More Around. This Is Also Your Typical Action Movie So There\u2019s Obviously Gonna Be Guns,Drugs And Viva La Locas Lol. But Overall 8/10 Movie A Perfect Buddy Movie Or Sleepover Movie\u2026 ANYONE WANNA PLAY TURKEY CUP !!!",

    "text": "Four Brothers est un film d\u2019action urbain qui, malgr\u00e9 une intrigue simple et parfois pr\u00e9visible, parvient \u00e0 offrir un divertissement honn\u00eate. Il s\u2019inscrit dans la lign\u00e9e de films comme Boyz n the Hood, mais avec beaucoup moins de profondeur \u00e9motionnelle et de port\u00e9e sociale. On pourrait presque le consid\u00e9rer comme une version plus brute et orient\u00e9e vers le spectaculaire, sans chercher \u00e0 proposer une r\u00e9elle r\u00e9flexion.\n\nL\u2019histoire de quatre fr\u00e8res adoptifs unis par la vengeance est assez classique, mais fonctionne gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019alchimie entre les personnages. M\u00eame si le sc\u00e9nario manque de subtilit\u00e9, on s\u2019attache \u00e0 leur lien fraternel et \u00e0 leur d\u00e9termination. L\u2019action est bien men\u00e9e, le rythme est soutenu, et l\u2019ambiance urbaine donne un style identifiable au film. Ce n\u2019est pas un chef-d'\u0153uvre, mais pour passer un moment sans trop se prendre la t\u00eate, Four Brothers fait le job.",
