The last 30 minutes of the movie went on a wild tangent and there were major plot twists and turns the kept the movie interesting and entertaining.",

Violence  and bubbling racial tension underpin this adult drama. It stays with you long after the closing credits ,as you try to process just what you have witnessed. Thoughtful and provocative but entertaining as hell. Recommend highly.",

This could have been a four star flick if the characters and the plot were given a little more depth. I felt it was pretty good for what it was given by the producers and writers.",

The acting is raw and haunting at times. I never felt I knew what was going to happen next. It was great to see a suspense, thriller, cop buddy movie that was so different from what Hollywood churns out. I will remember this movie for a long time.",
