    "text": "The Negotiator is one of those classic thrillers that still holds up well today. The plot is engaging from the start, throwing you into a tense, high-stakes standoff where trust and deception play a big role. The pacing is solid, though it stretches a bit in parts, but the setup and execution make up for it. \n\nF. Gary Gray's direction keeps the tension tight, balancing action and drama without overcomplicating things. The cinematography isn't flashy, but it works well in capturing the claustrophobic feel of the hostage situation, making you feel right there with the characters.\n\nWhat really makes this movie stand out is the acting. Samuel L. Jackson delivers an intense, gripping performance that makes it easy to connect with his character and root for him. Kevin Spacey plays off him perfectly, creating a dynamic where their back-and-forth feels natural and engaging. \n\nThe supporting cast is strong too, though some characters feel a bit underdeveloped. The script does a good job keeping the dialogue sharp and the tension high, but at times, it leans into familiar tropes that might feel predictable.\n\nThe score and sound design do their job well, enhancing the mood without being too overpowering. While the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable, the way sound is used to heighten key moments is effective. \n\nOverall, The Negotiator is a well-crafted thriller with strong performances and a gripping story. It might not be flawless, but it delivers where it counts, making it an easy movie to rewatch and appreciate.",

It's just that the entire premise is deflated by making the wrong guy the protagonist. It's very hard to sympathize with Jackson's character playing with other people's lives and the resources of an entire city just because he's doing the right thing.",

    "text": "A good film, but not a classic by any means. Kevin Spacey is great. Such a scene-stealer. And you can rarely go wrong with Sam L Jack. Was pleasantly surprised at how convincing he pulled off grief at a scene involving a funeral. The film does get a bit claustrophobic, same-y and a bit boring at times (it\u2019s far too long). It also doesn\u2019t quite come over re: its surprise reveals/twists. The stakes never feel that real either which I think is to the film\u2019s detriment.",
