Millie Bobby Brown \u00e8 intensa e convincente, e il film scorre senza mai annoiare. Il finale \u00e8 soddisfacente e chiude davvero la storia. Un ottimo fantasy, emozionante e ben fatto.",

Millie Bobby Brown gives such a powerful and emotional performance as Princess Elodie. I love how the story turns the classic fairy-tale idea upside down \u2014 instead of being rescued, she becomes her own hero. The action scenes are exciting, the dragon looks incredible,It\u2019s definitely one of my favorite movies, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, adventure.",

    "text": "Wow. I am quite impressed with this movie. It was supposed to be a fairytale about a girl from the poor family that all of the sudden becomes a princess. But unfortunately the royal family has a different plan. It turnes out that she is about to be a meal for a cave monster as an offering from the king and the queen which is a main part of agreement between them and a dragon.\nThis movie is about lies, betrayal and survival. I loved Millie Bobby Brown as a leading character. I am not sure that I ever saw a movie with her before (not as a main character at least).\nGreat visual effects! The dragon looks exactly like if the Basilisk from Harry Potter had wings lol. It was interesting to watch and I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed it.",

I loved it and I can't express that enough.\n\nAs someone living with severe C-PTSD, triggered by s-xual content, it\u2019s nearly impossible for me to find fantasy stories/media I can actually enjoy. Amazing dragon or fantasy movies get weighed down by scenes that make them unsafe for people like me way too much and it ruins potentially great content. \n\nDamsel is perfect for me. It means so much to me. It\u2019s dark, thrilling, emotional, and the dragon is everything I could hope for: powerful, intelligent, terrifying, and heartbreakingly beautiful. I actually really didn't like the design before watching the movie, but that has changed. I actually really love her. The fact that it delivers such an intense and gorgeous story without any s-xual content makes it a rare treasure. It gave me the ability to actually fully sink into the fantasy I love\u2014dragons, danger, and a heroine\u2019s strength\u2014without fear of being blindsided by something that would trigger a panic attack.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who adores dragons or dark fantasy but also needs a safe space away from s-xual content, this movie is a gift. For me, it wasn\u2019t just entertainment\u2014it was healing and a beacon of hope. I really hope they build more to this and a 2nd movie or a show comes out (without the s-xual content, I hope). Even if it isn't in this same universe or story, I would love to see more like this. I really needed this. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this. I appreciate you all so much! \ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude77",

    "text": "I watched Damsel without big expectations, and it surprised me in the best way.\n\nThe film gives us a fantasy story that feels fresh, with a young woman who doesn't wait to be saved \u2013 she saves herself. Millie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance as Elodie, combining vulnerability with courage.\n\nThe world-building is dark and beautiful, and the scenes inside the dragon\u2019s lair are truly captivating. The visual effects were better than I expected, and the pacing kept me interested from start to finish.\n\nI loved the message \u2013 that strength doesn\u2019t come from status or magic, but from within. I would absolutely love to see a second part, especially if it explores more of this world and Elodie\u2019s journey.\n\nPlease, Netflix \u2013 give us Damsel 2!\n\nHighly recommend this film for fans of fantasy with strong female leads.",
