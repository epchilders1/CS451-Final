Woody Harrelson makes for a fun and fantastic Carnage. This movie is arguably better than the first, and the fight scenes are a lot easier to watch and understand than the fight scenes between Venom and Riot in the first film.",

The second half is semi-watchable, but the former not only has terrible VFX, but lacks in character building (especially of Shriek) and relies mostly on one-liners that rarely land. They just want to get to the fighting. There are virtually no redeeming qualities of this film.",
