This movie puts you right in the action; you can almost feel the weight, the exhaustion, and the intensity of every moment as you move from scene to scene.\n\nAs the daughter of a retired military veteran, I have enormous respect for our soldiers, and this film deepened that respect even more. It\u2019s not just a war movie, it\u2019s a raw, emotional tribute to the bravery, sacrifice, and brotherhood of those who serve.\n\nGripping, heartbreaking, and unforgettable. Lone Survivor is a must-watch.",

Seeing what they had to go through portrayed by insanely talented actors that played their part PERFECTLY. The Directing, Acting, Casting, Editing & EVERYTHING is just excellent. If you have not seen this film.  You NEED to watch it. You will truly be inspired.",

    "text": "Brutal, gripping and emotionally devastating, Lone Survivor doesn\u2019t flinch from the horrors of war. Peter Berg delivers a tight, relentless film that captures the chaos and heartbreak of combat without grandstanding. The violence is hard to watch, but it should be. Wahlberg, Foster, Hirsch and Kitsch give grounded, deeply affecting performances, with Hirsch especially standing out. The falls, the wounds and the slow deterioration of each man\u2019s will to survive are shown with stark clarity. As war films go, this one leaves a mark. It\u2019s tough, timely and completely earned its spot in the modern canon.",
