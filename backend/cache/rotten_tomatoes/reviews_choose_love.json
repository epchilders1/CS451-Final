It's caused a lot of discussion amongst my friends, and we all really enjoyed it and can't recommend it more!",

    "text": "\"Choose Love\" was the BEST movie, and I thought the concept was so innovative and fun!  First, I watched all the endings by myself, and then I watched it again with a large group of friends.  It was so addictive - we actually saw all the endings again!! It was so well done, and couldn't have been more fun.  And Laura Marano was just so wonderful and endearing.  Netflix should definitely do a sequel and more interactive programming! We all just LOVED IT!\ud83e\udd70",

This movie isn't going to win any rewards, but we found ourselves going back to the movie over and over again to try and find new paths in the story. It was a fun time and wish Netflix would do more like these.",

I appreciated the witty dialogue and feel-good moments...it's a good pick-me-up for a cozy movie night \nI watched it first without making choices, then made a few the next time, it was better with my choices lol.",

    "text": "I think an interactive romantic comedy has the potential to be something great. While I do feel like the gimmick is kind of fun in \"Choose Love,\" this movie is as one-note as the genre can get. I went through the story with the choices that made sense to me, but I feel like regardless of who the main character ends up with, I was kind of indifferent. I could see the movie being a terrible one if it wasn't interactive, but I don't think the interactive feature does much to completely save it. Overall, I still would love to see more of these interactive films from Netflix, but maybe in a more exciting and engaging way in the future to come.",
