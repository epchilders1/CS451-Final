    "text": "Inside The Mind of Cat is a captivating documentary ideal for cat lovers, offering insights into feline psychology, habits, and their bond with humans, though it only lightly touches on the actual workings of a cat\u2019s mind. Visually engaging, it features adorable cat moments, playful animations, and cinematic techniques like slow motion, supported by fitting music to enhance the viewing experience. Expert commentary from various countries adds depth, while clear illustrations help explain the science, making it both informative and enjoyable for audiences of all ages.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)",

While there was some subjective information it appeared to be Just another group of semi/non professional\n\u201cCat\u201dpeople  incapable of quantifying the virtues and\u201d\u201dmysteries\u201d..of their pets without making smug negative references to dogs\u2026 Unnecessary and essentially boring  Case in point \u201cmysterious\u201dand \u201cindependent\u201d  (overused and unnecessary as their usage promotes the myth that cats are inscrutable and  of course much more discriminating in sharing themselves and therefore superior to dogs  apparent cretins that  will love anything that isn\u2019t dead.. and of course that is what  the folks that put this waste of time together intended. no one bothered to mention that dogs\u2019 readily apparent social responses to humans have  their origins  rooted in evolved pack behavior  .. No nothing that erudite or illuminating One vet commented on the fact that cats have amazing ( which they do\u201d spatial references such that they always land on their feet.. and if you push a dog off a couch it will not have the same facility ( he was a cat vet)\u2026.hilaaaaarious video of someone pushing their  dog off a couch to prove the point. I\nThis was an unscientific representation of owners and alleged experts aka dog haters  who lacked objectivity and I would imagine any scientific education cooing and oozing over there charges while providing  little didactic educational material that didn\u2019t demand a reference to dogs lol\u2026lack of objectivity appears to be an ongoing thing with cat lovers \nTotally boring.. I learned as much about lions watching  The Lion King.. however i do know that if a cat falls off a couch it doesn\u2019t always land in its feet\u2026 Hope I didn\u2019t break any hearts lol and fyi I am a vet tech\u2026 I like both species and we need more documentaries which are actually educational and highlights attributes of both species without negative references to the other \u2026 because without that a presentation including this one lacks merit and cannot call itself a diocumentary",

    "text": "\"Inside the Mind of a Cat\" (2022 release; 67 min) is a documentary that examines cat behavior and aims to explain how cats think. There are a number of talking heads that walk us through these issues, but the real stars of this documentary are of course the cats themselves. Along the way, we learn and appreciate a number of aspects about our furry friends.\n\nThis documentary is written and produced by Andy Mitchell, who has a long track record of documentaries with/about various animals. If you are, like me, a long time cat lover (I've had cats for well over 3 decades), this documentary is almost certainly going to please you and entertain you, even if you're really not learning anything revolutionary or new as such about cats. One of those \"revelations\" is that cats pick up on our feelings, and if you love them, they almost certainly will love you back. Really? I could've told you that 30 years ago!\n\n\"Inside the Mind of a Cat\" was recommended to me by Netflix based on my viewing habits. I really enjoyed this, certainly more so than \"The Secret Life of Pets\", which I also watched recently. If you are a cat lover, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Eu tenho um gato chamado Miguel, e tentar compreender os gatos \u00e9 um desafio grande, pois eles s\u00e3o muito diferentes dos c\u00e3es. Assistindo a este document\u00e1rio da Netflix me ajudou a exclarecer um pouco mais ou melhor a fimar suspeitas que eu j\u00e1 tinha. Um document\u00e1rio que passa com especialistas de v\u00e1rias partes do mundo, EUA, Jap\u00e3o, europa. Tanto no Jap\u00e3o existem caf\u00e9 de gatos e em quantidades enormes, onde quem n\u00e3o pode ou n\u00e3o estrutura para criar um #pet v\u00e3o a estes caf\u00e9s e interagem com eles. Aqui no Brasil pude ir na cidade de Sorocaba \u2013 SP. E passam tamb\u00e9m que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel adestrar um gato. Foi legal em ver o document\u00e1rio com feedbacks de v\u00e1rios especialistas que se n\u00e3o me engano na totalidade era mulheres. Ser\u00e1 que elas tem uma intera\u00e7\u00e3o maior que os homens?\nVale apena assistir? Sim para quem quer compreender melhor seus bichanos e quem curte pets.\nNota: 7",
