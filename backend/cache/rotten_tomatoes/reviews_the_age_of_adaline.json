There are plenty of talented actors whose parents are well-known in Hollywood, Lively is not one of them. Waste of screenplays every single time!",

    "text": "What if we stopped aging altogether, immune to the ravages of time, never worrying about the process of slowly withering away? But just because time doesn\u2019t move with us doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t stop for love 10 years old and this serves as a familiar tale we all know Yet it acts as a fable touching upon things like mediation on immortality, impermanence, loneliness, loss of life, and the struggle to find love thanks to director Lee Toland Kriger Blake Lively plays Adaline Bowman; she\u2019s an ordinary woman born in 1908 She was married and had a family of her own Then one night driving home she gets into a car accident and by some magical set of circumstances her body chemistry is drastically altered From that moment on Adaline has gained the gift of immortality being immune to the ravages of time not aging another day It seems unbelievable to her but there are obstacles to contend with; everyone else around her still dies either by natural causes etc., she has to keep moving from place to place to avoid suspicion given the many decades she lives through, it also pains her that she cannot be with someone having a real relationship In present day she meets a young man named Ellis, he becomes the apple of her eye yet she\u2019s very reluctant to make it real believing she can spare him the pain of him staying young Harrison Ford also plays a supporting role tying to Adaline\u2019s past which hits hard for her The film is utterly romantic with a love for things nostalgic of days long gone along with some good acting When you don\u2019t age like everyone else it\u2019s not the same when you don\u2019t grow old, that love be everlasting and have meaning only heartbreak, is there something we can hold onto and never let go, some of us don\u2019t know how to have a life after so long, it\u2019s also a true testament nobody wants to live forever, time is precious, and love can be eternal, our bodies grow old but our passion can abide, it\u2019s much stronger than longevity Blake Lively\u2019s performance really carries the film even if it feels a bit saccharine and more along the lines of a Lifetime tv feature It also feels a bit long being nearly 2 hours But the movie goes over the ruminations of living an eternal lonely existence in a believable manner without leaning too heavily into the sci-fi aspect with undertones of melancholy and yearning for a connection Ellen Burstyn and Amanda Crew are wonderful supporting players as well with heartfelt performances The costumes for each decade are spot-on too next to warm cinematography For Adaline she\u2019s an old soul having the wisdom and weariness never growing old being a big downside so the movie addresses several of the pitfalls living with something that feels like a burden Again Lively\u2019s performance is the strength of this romance meets science-fiction tale making us appreciate our own mortality",

    "text": "Fairytales make magic so that they can reveal something about reality. This movie suspended reality and stayed there, never telling a single truth about anything. Adeline doesn't age and everyone around her does. So, she pretends to be 29 and dates other men of this age group. These young men aren't intimidated by her at all. They are allured by her maturity, wit and knowledge and fall quickly in love with her. What reality is this, again? Because most 29 year old women are faced with guys who can't be anywhere around a woman who is superior in any way to them. In reality, men would be running away from Adeline, at best, or at worst, actively loathing her. There is no way a 101-year-old Adeline would want anything to do with a 29 year old man. I found it more likely (though still not very likely) that she'd be a better companion to Harrison Ford's character simply because he was older. Then, to find out that he was the love of her life but, oops, she's dating his son and has fallen for him, instead, for some unknown reason... It was just ICK. There was never a believable moment in this film. I thought the acting was wonderful. Blake Lively and Harrison Ford were fantastic. But... there was no truth anywhere here.",

The script for Ellis trying to win Adaline was a bit creepy, stalky and pushy and lacked the chemistry another actor could have delivered.  The other actors and their scripts were fine.",
