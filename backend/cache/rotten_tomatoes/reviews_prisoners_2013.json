There are some good performances and gritty cinematography, and you are carried along for a time - it just about manages to make you suspend your disbelief until the end, but, perhaps, only just. It doesn't hold up to scrutiny on reflection. You won't want to watch it again, unless to pick holes in the plot, because it depends on the d\u00e9nouement.",

Thriller, Drama or something...\nNot Horror.\nUsually, when it a long film, it's filled with filler content.\nThis one was different.\n\nBrief synopsis;\nTwo young girls vanish.\nHell Bent Revenge Dad out for, well, Revenge...\nDetective actually doing good work and trying to solve crime...\nMany misunderstandings and distrust begin.\nThing is, at 2.5hrs long, I'm usually very sceptical ov what's being screened.\nVery few scenes could be cut from this one.\nWell written for thee screen.\nWe enjoyed it.\n\nVaughn Roxx gives this 4 Stars.\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\nSun Angel Roxx gives this 4 Stars.\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nTotal 8 Stars out ov 10.\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nDefinitely worth a look.\n\ud83e\udd19\ud83d\ude0e",

Yet, for all its success, it's difficult to overlook a lot of the sloppiness reflected in some random, unexplained character motives and clich\u00e9d detours seen in many mediocre thrillers.",

My wife and I have never had as quiet of a ride home from the movie theatre before or after and we don\u2019t even have kids. The cast, the score and the acting couldn\u2019t of been any better. Extra credit to Gyllenhall, Jackman and Dano they nailed very demanding roles that had to stay w them as well, it couldn\u2019t of been easy. If you have young kids I\u2019d strongly recommend sitting this one out. To all involved- a sincere thank you for making such a outstanding, grippingly grim, emotionally charged, penetrative piece of cinema\u2026Bravo!",

Before he was the Dune guy, Villaneuve did this very organic mystery that also managed to insert a couple ridiculous smart plot twists in the middle. The ending made perfect sense, but it was also camoflaged perfectly. One of the best mysteries you could ever watch.",
