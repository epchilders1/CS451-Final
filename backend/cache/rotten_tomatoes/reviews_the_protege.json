Goes for the music as well that does everything it can to tell you how bad-ass they think the main character is and how talented she is at everything from assassination to baking muffins.\n\nMainly, though, it's the dialog that kills all cred for this show.  I like Maggie Q, but could barely make it through the first episode and that's where I stopped.",

    "text": "Overall a decent action movie. The plot had a few holes but was easy enough to follow. The dialogue felt clunky at times, but there were also some good lines. The ending felt a bit rushed and like the movie was trying too hard to make a point. Also, Michael Keaton? Really?? He's 30 years older than her! Maggie Q is strutting around all gorgeous and young and next to her he just looks like an old thumb. Seriously, they couldn't find anyone else who matched her age (and looks and vibe) better?",

    "text": "Maggie Q shines in this slick action thriller, delivering both emotional depth and razor-sharp fight sequences. Her presence elevates The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and her action choreography is a real standout\u2014gritty, precise, and believable. While the plot follows familiar revenge-thriller beats, the chemistry between Maggie Q and Michael Keaton, along with stylish direction and fast-paced action, make it an enjoyable watch. It may not be groundbreaking, but it delivers where it counts.",

    "text": "All the main characters are played by actors about 20years too old. The dialogue is clunky, some scenes the attempt at 'witty repartee' is utterly awful. The story is thin to say the least. Some good action scenes - impossible but well choregraphed. But Keaton and Jackson are simply too old and slow. Maggie Q gets by with the weapons but the martial arts bit is unlikely. Good actors in a very B movie.",
