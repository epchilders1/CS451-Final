I think the way RDJ's voice sounded also made it an annoying movie.\n\nRewatching it in 2025 in Netflix after watching a lot of b-tier movies pre MCU and other slow paced movies, RDJ's Dolittle is actually quite a good movie.",

    "text": "Dolittle, featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland, falls into that category of films that you didn\u2019t necessarily ask for. While it\u2019s not a terrible movie and provides some entertainment for the younger audience, it ultimately lacks the compelling nature that would make it a must-see. This new iteration diverges significantly from the original Dr. Dolittle films starring Eddie Murphy, taking a fresh but ultimately disappointing path with Robert Downey Jr. at the helm.\n\nIn my opinion, the screenplay felt a bit rough around the edges, riddled with issues that could have been addressed with some thoughtful revisions. It reminds me of the importance of collaboration between directors and screenwriters. If a director feels hesitant to challenge a screenplay that doesn\u2019t resonate, it can lead to a disjointed final product. Everyone involved is there to contribute their expertise, and if a scene doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s crucial to address it\u2014even if that means a rewrite.\n\nPersonally, I found the abundance of animals and unnecessary world-building to detract from the narrative. The story strayed so far from the essence of the original film that it felt like a missed opportunity for a fresh adaptation that could have built on the beloved storylines. The original films set a high bar, and this attempt sadly fell short.\n\nWith an impressive ensemble cast that includes Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Tom Holland, Craig Robinson, Tommy Colette, Kumail Nanjiani, and Selena Gomez, one might expect audiences to flock to this film. However, the reality is that even with such star power, characters still need to be well-written. Even if their roles are minor, giving them moments that matter can elevate the film, rather than making them feel like mere background players.",
