No more ridiculous storylines than James Bond.\n\nI am increasingly finding that critic reccomended movies are... \ud83e\udd14...  crap and often abandoned half way through.\n\nNote to critics... Movies are NOT ART. It is a couple of hours of entertainment.",

I was really only here to see Will Smith smack his wife's name out of his own mouth, and I was not disappointed. sure, they could have investigated more of the concerns behind cloning humans to be lethal weapons and they definitely missed a sequel setup opportunity that would have been as easy as having another clone watch the happily every after ending from afar. still good tho. action was decent. dialogue a bit dry. character arcs were nothing impressive, but the archetypes still fun and personable. i'd give it  3-4/5",

Will Smith keren sih mainin dua karakter sekaligus, tapi yang bikin mikir itu konfliknya... soal identitas, masa lalu, dan pilihan hidup. Meskipun CGI-nya belum sempurna, film ini tetap layak buat dinikmati.",

Otherwise bland and will smith plays it like he is exhausted. Not really worth your time unless you've nothing better to do, in which case, it's not the worst thing to watch.",
