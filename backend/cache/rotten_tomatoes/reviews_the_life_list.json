Sadly, though, I might have given up on Sofia Carson being more than a Netflix rom-com actress. Her performances continue to be fairly wooden.",

There are alot of good scene's with amazing diologe and acting but there are more scenes that lack just that. \nIt's as if the Actors got tired of each other as they where filming it and then the diologe feels so one dimensional almost like a student with English FAL wrote it for a creative writing peace. \n\nIf this movie was executed better would have been a cinematic mast piece because the cinematography is so good but the dialogue lacks depth and the acting lacks realism.",

    "text": "You know how sometimes you see a professional critic's score that's low, and then you see the viewer's scores that are higher? That's usually how I judge whether to watch a movie or not. If the real viewer's score is much higher than the pros, I'm in. And you know what? They were right. This is a terrific movie. In fact, this movie deserves a much higher score than both gave it. This is not your usual romcom or whatever category they've put it into. The writing is superb, the dialogue witty, the characters are well developed, the storyline is not your typical fare, and the actors are all superb, especially Sofia Carson. Wow. The editing is also very very good. There's no corny dialogue, no pandering to the viewers and yes, sue me, but I love a great family/love story that doesn't have a tragic ending like so many do these days. If you want to laugh, maybe cry, maybe feel some nostalgia for your own childhood and growing up issues and experiences, you must watch, \"Life List\".",

It's the kind of film that you figure out what happens next! Another thing that bothered me was the fact that it was too damn long! never ending, in fact! This could have easily been a 1.3 hour movie. There was nothing superb regarding the acting, either. Sadly, movies like this make me question if I should keep justifying my Netflix monthly subscription.",
