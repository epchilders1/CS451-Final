    "text": "The movie is great and a good interpretation of what a live-action Cat in the Hat is capable of, with slapstick humor and great acting by the children and step dad it also shows how things might always come to light, as seen with how the stepdad treated the kids and how the Cat in the Hat helps get rid of him. The movie is great; I hate all the negative reviews.
