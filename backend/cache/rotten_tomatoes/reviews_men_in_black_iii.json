    "text": "This is so very similar to the previous film. I didn\u2019t like the time travel and the story was stupid. It held my attention though and the jokes are less repetitive. The effects and production in general looked a lot better. I thought the villain was cool. And the alien character Griffin reminded me of Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy and was a great addition to the film. Overall only worth watching if you liked the first two.",

Amazing cinematography and effects. Very well written and brought to screen. Whole cast excels in character very convincingly. Highly entertaining and gripping",

Not only that, to me, Jemaine Clement did an amazing job playing an antagonist, and I appreciate the makeup that the crew did for him, and that\u2019s a 5-star review right there!",
