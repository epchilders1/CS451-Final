It lacks in showing the contempt between dean Highbottom and Dr. Gaul and rushes through key pieces that show the Snow we've come to hate. \nMany events happen out of order from the book, jumbling the story line. \nEasily the worst Hunger Games adaptation yet.",

    "text": "I am conflicted here.  There are tons of great elements here - it is well put together and acted, it looks pretty good, even with all the CGI.  The premise was decent, but this is where it get a bit murky.  First of all, the premise is just a remake of the Anakin Skywalker prequels.  And not even that well written.  We KNOW Snow will turn evil, but we want to know how, and this thing was super meandering and ponderous with side plots that didn't matter.  MAYBE it would have been better as a trilogy or a series?  Not sure.  Next up, they TRASHED the original flick... Katniss was supposed to be the bomb, but nope, Snow White did it first and did it best.  Then they lifted characters out of the original - Schwartzman was Tucci, Dinklage was Haymitch, etc.  I wasn't expecting a lot from Zegler, and I think she did ok, but the singing went on way too long and in too many places.  Yeah, this is supposed to be a teeny bopper flick, but geez.",

    "text": "Visually appealing. Broken story can be hard to follow. Dialogue not genuine makes it hard to buy into story. A lot of regurgitated ideas from first movies that just seem thrown in. Confusing unbelievable ending. Storyline seems like a bunch of run on ideas thinly sewn together the audience is just expected to keep following. Liked the singing but song lyrics not so much.",

I found it really entertaining before the games during the games after the games, you can tell people saying it\u2019s boring are just in it to see the games ( much like the capital in the original trilogy.) I love the characters and I love the setting, the nature in part III is beautiful There are so many amazing shots and visuals in this movie. It feels so alive. The only thing I have to say is sometimes you can tell that it\u2019s a book, that the writing was from a book but that\u2019s okay. Definitely recommend. it\u2019s a great entry into what\u2019s to come next in the hunger games franchise",

The rest they should've kept in the stash. Let's talk about Lucy. Didn't\nliked her from very beginning and I don't know who allowed her to sing on the stage\nonce she was chosen... She literally did nothing on the battlefield. She shouldn't have\nwon, honestly. And btw, the battlefield was boring, the battle scenes sucked. I get that\nit was a long time ago but that probably was their cover to play safe when it comes to\nthe structure and location of the Hunger Games. The 2nd part of the movie was\nextremely boring (couldn't wait the movie to end actually). And I didn't knew that\nbefore Katniss smbd won from District 12 besides Haymitch, and that it was a GIRL who won before? Miss me with this bs. Disappointed. The old movies are so good, but with this prequel they just.... Oh...",

The movie strayed too much from the book, omitted crucial points, changed character deaths, changed Lucy Grays personality, sped through her and Snows relationship to the point that it felt unlikely. I feel like if a movie is made from a book, it should atleast convey the message intended by the author and I found this movie lacking at no fault of the actors at all. Disappointed.",

Nothing against singing but I don't know this character, she may be your strong female lead but you have to build up to it. Rest of the film might be great, or it might, pathetically have a turn of events of her being a \"spectacle\" by singing, and I'm not wasting my time to find out.",

    "text": "This movie is much different from the book. In the book, Snow is not portrayed as a benevolent saint, as he is in the film. I also feel that the relationship between Lucy and Snow is rushed. I loved the first three movies and books, which are closely related, but this film strays too far from the source material, particularly in regards to Snow's character. Sejanus is depicted as more compassionate than Snow in the books, yet he comes across as a whiny brat in the movie, and their roles are literally switched in some scenes. They were not as friendly towards each other as the film suggests. Snow resents Sejanus most of the time.\n\nWhile I believe the cast is great, Lucy is not Katniss; she (Lucy) is much kinder and more lovable in the book and does not try so hard to fit the interpretation that Zegler presents. However, I acknowledge that the books revolve around Snow's thoughts, and it's challenging to convey those thoughts without a narrator. On a positive note, I really love the set design and costume work; the Capitol looks fantastic!",
