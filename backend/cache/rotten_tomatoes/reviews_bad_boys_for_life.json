    "text": "**Review:**\n\nAs a long-time *Bad Boys* fan, I walked into *Bad Boys for Life* with cautious hype\u2014and walked out grinning. Seeing Will Smith and Martin Lawrence back after all these years feels like cinematic comfort food, and directors Adil & Bilal handle the reunion with style. The plot\u2019s the strongest of the trilogy for me: Mike nearly killed, hunting down his would-be assassin, while Marcus fumbles with retirement and comic relief. The balance of heavier drama and buddy banter works surprisingly well. It\u2019s weightier than the first two films, but that tension pays off. Adil & Bilal honor Michael Bay\u2019s flashy chaos while putting their own stamp on it. Not perfect, but it earns its stripes. Roll on the next one.\n\n**Recommendation:** Worth a watch for fans.\n**Next step:** Queue it up before the sequel drops.",

    "text": "Well it's better than 2 I guess but it's just a forgettable legacy franchise entry at the end of the day. The music is decent but it feels like it's just trying to recapture the tunes from the first one. Everything else is just alright. It's totally watchable and feels almost like a Fast & Furious sequel in a sense with the hammed in family themes and over the top action. This starts out kind of good actually and the best moments are the serious family heart to heart moments with Lawrence and Smith. Too bad those all but disappear in the second half. Lots of the action scenes is stuff we've seen before and suffer the same problem 2 did where they drag on longer than they should. The main duo is decent but everyone else is just so forgettable, used as plot vehicles, or barely given much time. The biggest problem here is the bloated plot. This tries to fit in sooooo much and feels like a daytime soap opera with guns and explosions. The baby, retirement, Smith's injury which is all but glossed over, mortality, the son twist which is sooooo stupid, farfetched and over the top. And than add on a Cartel plot that's convuluted with Ammo thrown in and than jumping around half the time between the two and it just gets so jumpy, over the top, and isn't so much hard to follow but just bloated and farfetched. Than sequel baiting at the end like a F&F movie. The ending and the villian feels like villian you'd see in a fantasy movie almost with how the end fight is done and is a CGI fest. It's never incoherent or boring though as most bad daytime soap operas go. But still skip this. It's a forgettable action flick at the end of the day. Disappointing trilogy entry.",

This movie starts out with a bang with the prison escape and Mike being shot and ends with a bang with an amazing climax that had a helicopter crash through the building. The series took a brake for a while and when it came back it picked up where they left off and just climbed higher the before. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are wonderful to watch.",
