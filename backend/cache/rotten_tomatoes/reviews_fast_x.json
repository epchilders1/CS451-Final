I wouldn't pay anyone to be in this film. SHITE......",

Bonkers, warped, deranged and downright nuts (he wears a tutu/skirt fgs and tries to be a ballerina I mean WTF?). Genuine shock at the mid credits scene. Sets us up perfectly for the series finale next year.",

    "text": "Comedy sequels don't have the best track record. The structure of comedies do not lend themselves to follow ups. Jokes are never as funny the second time you hear them, and this comedy repeats a LOT of jokes from the first one. To complicate matters further, it has been about 30 years since the previous movie. That makes this a legacy comedy sequel. It has a similar problem to \"Space Jam: a New Legacy\". The final act of both films involve some nonsense version of the sport. It makes it hard for the audience to follow or feel any suspense when they don't know by what rules they are being measured.\n\nThe cameos they have, particularly with the professional athletes, are very funny. The new villains present an interesting foe for Gilmore. And the new character stuff for Happy is... an inconsistent tone. Like, this is material that isn't good enough to be serious and is too serious to be funny.",

With this Paul walker street racing in a skyline to John cena flying canoe boats out of flying planes, like what is this. It\u2019s a completely different franchise now, and the script was absolutely terrible. Some of the most cringe lines I\u2019ve ever heard. Don\u2019t bring a part 2 out, end it there.",

The film leans into family, loyalty, and revenge as central themes. Though the plot is wild and chaotic, it delivers pure entertainment. A thrilling ride for fans of the saga.\n\nThomas fandi\u00f1o franco",
