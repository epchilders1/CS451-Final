The vocals were top notch.  I personally think the older adaptations are overrated, they all hold their weight simply because the premise and messaging of the original story is timeless. Otherwise they bring nothing new to the table, this version is a breath of fresh air.",

My grand children found it and asked us to join them to watch.   They understood it and really enjoyed.  Don't over think it.   Happy Christmas.",

    "text": "The singing is good, and I guess I can say the animation is creative, but this is an example of re-imagining going too far, such that the quality of the story is lost in the attempt to make changes just for the sake of change. They spent way too much effort trying to bedazzle the audience with colorful and weird ghost sequences. They also changed some characters for representation in ways that are simply not believable or accurate for the time period. You've got to stay true to the story structure, at the very least.",

Filled with catchy songs, magnificent graphics and a new flair on an old favorite. \n\nScrooge: A Christmas Story, finds a way to follow the classic novel while being enjoyable to both children and adults. I was excited to see it back in my options.",

    "text": "With a splashy, aim-to-dazzle allure in the vain of Baz Luhrman\u2019s work, Netflix\u2019s \u2018Scrooge: A Christmas Carol\u2019 is undoubtedly the most glitzy telling of the well-known tale. There are certainly moments that tried too hard, and this version at times comes across as more Disco than Dickens; however, that said, it does add its own charm, twists while remaining fairly faithful to the original work. It adds splashes of refreshingly vibrant colors in contrast to its dark, often drab Victorian predecessors (some notable exceptions of course being 1988\u2019s \u2018Scrooged\u2019 with Bill Murray, \u2018The Muppet Christmas Carol\u2019 in 1992,  and FX\u2019s dark, often perverse take in their 2019 miniseries). The musical numbers are hit or miss; Luke Evans has pipes, no doubt - but I won\u2019t be expecting any of the songs to become holiday bangers any time soon (or, let\u2019s be real, probably ever). Though some of the animation sequences may make one question if someone had slipped acid into old Ebenezer\u2019s porridge that night, if nothing else, \u2018Scrooge\u2019 will likely keep the attention of the little ones, and introducing a new generation to a classic story is of course always encouraged. Hundreds of adaptations have been made, and they\u2019re not all going to be brilliant. This telling is not one of the worse ones, but it\u2019s quite likely not a new annual staple, either.",

    "text": "Looking at the thumbnail of the video, I thought that this movie looked like an algorithm chasing, procedurally generated Christmas film. I even left the film after the first musical number. It lost me after they gave Scrooge a dog. It seemed out of character for a tightfisted Scrooge to spend any time or money on a dog. But I came back later and finished watching, and to this movie's credit, there is some genuine effort put into this adaptation.\n\n\"A Christmas Carol\" is likely the most adapted piece of fiction of all time. And some people may be understandably sick of them, but I personally love the story. Each version has something unique about it that it does better than the rest. And \"Scrooge\" (2022) is no exception.\n\nThis one does the characters of Fanny and Belle better than any previous version I have seen. I also enjoyed the slight twist on the cemetery scene towards the end. I also get the sense that the animators would consistently ask, \"what is the most visually interesting way we can do this scene?\" before each section. The movie still would need another once over to be theatrical quality, but it's not bad.\n\nOn the negative side, the movie does not use its time well. At an 1hr 43, the movie spends too much time on unimportant details, like the transitions from scene to scene. The addition of a dog, and some flying demons feel like studio notes to make the film more interesting to kids. There are a number of little things that the film does wrong that loses the impact of the original. Jacob Marley's scene, the reveal of Scrooge, scenes like that are handled either too jovially or too over the top.\n\nOh yeah, this version is a musical as well. It's all OK, nothing too bad, nothing too memorable.\n\nIf you think there are already too many versions of \"a Christmas Carol\", this isn't the adaptation to change your mind. But if you like the story and can go for another version, you'll like this version fine. It may have a few sour notes, but it is still a sweet Christmas carol.",

It treats the serious subjects in a Christmas Carol with respect while telling the story in a suitable manner for younger children.  As an adult, I found myself surprised by the quality of the songs and, despite myself, touched by the story a time or two.\n\nIf you are looking for a family movie that is entertaining and full of Christmas magic, look no further.",
