    "text": "Mikey\u2019s Movie Review: Frankenstein (2025)\nWritten, produced & directed by Guillermo del Toro\nBased on the novel by Mary Shelley (1818)\nStarring Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth & Christoph Waltz\n\nAs expected, del Toro has delivered another beautiful looking, aesthetically pleasing gothic horror. The use of practical FX is refreshing, the story holds close to Shelly\u2019s original (but told from both Frankenstein\u2019s and the Creatures point of view) and the cast is divine, yet\u2026\nit falls short of greatness with pacing, and despite its $120 million budget, some very cheap looking CGI. \n\nExpanding the role of Victor\u2019s brother William and making him older (he\u2019s only 5 years old in the novel) to introduce the love interest of his fianc\u00e9 Lady Elizabeth Harlander, del Toro gives his version another layer. Another complex dynamic between the central quartet. \nAlthough in doing so he makes the journey / redemptive arc much longer than it really needs to be. Instead of a lean, bloody retelling it\u2019s often flabby. While Felix Kammerer (as William) isn\u2019t quite up the task in a thankless role unlike seasoned veteran Oscar Isaac. His Victor is manic, overblown, theatrical and somewhat melodramatic which perfectly fits the Hammer inspired tone.\n\nMia Goth turns in another great performance, although her character feels slightly out of step with the period (though that was perhaps the point). The extended cast too is phenomenal with a delightfully eccentric cameo from Christoph Waltz, and smaller roles for the likes of Charles Dance and Burn Gorman. \nThe true star of the film however is Jacob Elordi as the creature. He imbues him with so much warmth, pathos and tenderness it\u2019s tough to hold back the tears come the finale. \n\nThe Shape Of Water remains my personal favourite film from del Toro, and while this and many of his works share some DNA, I doubt Frankenstein will be regarded in quite the same light. It\u2019s simply missing the richness and inventiveness of his usual work. \n\nNo classic then, but absolutely worthy of your time. \n\nMikey\u2019s Movie Rating: 4/5*",

    "text": "Frankenstein: The Ride I Couldn\u2019t Take but the Movie I Needed. I didn\u2019t get to ride Monsters Unchained at Epic Universe because I was too big for the seat, so I sat outside listening to the screams echo through the lab. Watching Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Frankenstein felt a lot like that: standing just outside the experiment, watching something beautiful come alive.\n\nIt\u2019s not a monster rampage; it\u2019s a Gothic slow burn about creation, guilt, and the ache of being seen. Oscar Isaac plays Victor as a man drunk on genius, and Jacob Elordi\u2019s Creature isn\u2019t a brute but a soul still learning how to exist. Every frame drips with candlelight and sorrow, every shadow feels hand-stitched by Del Toro himself.\n\nBy the end, I realized I didn\u2019t need the theme-park ride after all. I\u2019d already taken one.\n\nzombiesinmyblog.com/frankenstein-the-ride-i-couldnt-take-but-the-movie-i-needed/",

    "text": "Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein: A Monstrous Masterpiece That Resurrects the Soul of Horror\n\nIn the pantheon of cinematic reimaginings, Guillermo del Toro's *Frankenstein* stands as a towering colossus, a film that doesn't just adapt Mary Shelley's 1818 novel but exhumes its beating heart and stitches it anew with threads of profound humanity, gothic splendor, and unflinching terror. Premiering to rapturous acclaim at this year's festivals, del Toro's vision\u2014his long-gestating passion project finally brought to life\u2014proves to be not merely a horror film, but a symphony of sorrow and wonder. It's the best movie of 2025, bar none, and arguably the finest achievement in genre filmmaking since del Toro's own *The Shape of Water* reshaped our dreams eight years ago. This is cinema that lingers like a fever dream, haunting and healing in equal measure.\n\nDel Toro, ever the alchemist of the macabre, honors Shelley's foundational text while boldly reanimating it for our fractured era. Gone is the novel's epistolary structure and some of its more aloof philosophical detours; in their place, del Toro injects a visceral intimacy, centering the narrative on the electric bond\u2014and brutal rupture\u2014between creator and creation. Victor Frankenstein's hubris remains the spark, but del Toro amplifies the Creature's rage into a poignant cry against isolation, weaving in contemporary echoes of exile and identity that feel ripped from today's headlines without ever preaching. These changes aren't dilutions; they're evolutions, transforming Shelley's cautionary tale into a mirror for our monster-making world, where science and solitude collide with devastating grace.\n\nFrom the first frame, the production quality announces itself as a triumph of tactile artistry. Del Toro's direction is a masterclass in controlled chaos\u2014sweeping crane shots through fog-shrouded laboratories give way to claustrophobic close-ups of trembling hands and flickering candlelight, every movement deliberate, every shadow pregnant with intent. The writing, co-penned by del Toro with his frequent collaborator Scott Ridley, crackles with poetic ferocity: dialogue that bites like Shelley's prose, laced with metaphors of birth and betrayal that elevate the script beyond genre tropes. \"We are all assembled from the scraps of our making,\" Victor intones early on, a line that reverberates through the film's emotional core, underscoring del Toro's genius for forging poetry from pain.\n\nBut it's the special effects that truly electrify, a deliberate rebuke to our CGI-saturated age. Del Toro champions practical wizardry here, with the Creature's resurrection sequence\u2014a grotesque ballet of sutures, lightning, and raw flesh\u2014crafted through prosthetics, animatronics, and old-school stop-motion that pulses with lifelike menace. No green-screen shortcuts; every scar gleams with the sweat of artisans, every limb twitches with mechanical ingenuity. The result is effects work that feels alive, intimate, and utterly immersive, harking back to the glory days of Rick Baker and Tom Savini while pushing boundaries into something profoundly empathetic. In an era of digital detachment, this is effects design with soul\u2014monstrous, yes, but achingly human.\n\nVisually, the aesthetic is del Toro at his most intoxicating: a fevered fusion of Romantic sublime and Victorian decay, drenched in palettes of bruised blues, arterial reds, and the sickly glow of bioluminescent elixirs. The costumes, under the meticulous eye of designer Lindy Hemming, are wearable poetry\u2014Victor's disheveled frock coats, frayed at the cuffs like unraveling sanity; the Creature's patchwork hides, layered with scavenged furs and metallic implants that whisper of forbidden alchemy. Set design elevates it all to operatic heights: Alexandre Hammid's production design conjures a Geneva of perpetual twilight, where Victor's lair is a labyrinth of brass gears, bubbling retorts, and towering bookcases groaning under forbidden tomes. Rain-lashed cobblestones and mist-veiled Alps frame the exile sequences, turning nature itself into a co-conspirator in the tragedy. It's a world you can smell\u2014the ozone of storms, the copper tang of blood\u2014del Toro's direction ensuring every element conspires to ensnare the senses.\n\nThreading through this tapestry are the poetic connections del Toro weaves, subtle yet seismic. He draws lyrical parallels between Frankenstein's hubris and the Creature's quest for kinship, echoing Shelley's themes of parental abandonment with motifs of fractured mirrors and inverted reflections\u2014Victor glimpsing his own monstrosity in his creation's eyes. A recurring lullaby, hummed by a spectral chorus, binds their fates, transforming the story into a requiem for the unloved, where science becomes a surrogate for the divine spark we all crave. These aren't flourishes; they're the film's beating pulse, turning horror into haunting elegy.\n\nAnd oh, the cast\u2014a constellation of talent orbiting two supernova performances that anchor the film's emotional maelstrom. Jacob Elordi as the Creature is a revelation, a seismic debut in the role that shatters every preconception. Towering yet tender, Elordi's physicality\u2014those deliberate, lumbering steps evolving into a dancer's grace\u2014conveys the agony of awakening with raw, unspoken eloquence. Beneath layers of makeup that accentuate his aquiline features into something both pitiable and primal, he imbues the monster with a feral curiosity and bottomless grief, his eyes (those piercing, storm-gray orbs) conveying volumes that lesser actors couldn't voice. When the Creature weeps\u2014not with guttural roars, but silent, shuddering sobs\u2014it's Elordi's quiet fury that breaks you, a performance of such layered vulnerability it demands awards-season worship. He's not just the heart of the film; he's its howling conscience.\n\nOpposite him, Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein delivers a tour de force of tormented brilliance. Isaac, with his chameleon intensity, captures the doctor's descent from feverish idealist to shattered recluse with a precision that borders on the surgical\u2014his voice cracking like thunder over whispered incantations, his frame coiling tighter with each moral compromise. In their charged confrontations, Isaac and Elordi generate a father-son alchemy that's equal parts tender and terrifying, their chemistry crackling like the storm that births the beast. The supporting ensemble shines too\u2014Lia Williams as a steely Elizabeth, radiating quiet ferocity; Felix Kammerer as the loyal Clerval, a beacon of unscarred warmth\u2014but it's Isaac's unraveling genius that makes Victor's folly feel like our own.\n\n*Frankenstein* isn't just a film; it's a resurrection, a defiant act of creation that reminds us why we tell these stories. Del Toro has given Shelley's immortal work the adaptation it deserved\u2014one that honors its bones while breathing fresh fire into its veins. In a year of bold swings and safe bets, this is the one that lands like lightning: profound, exhilarating, unforgettable. See it in theaters, let it scar you sweetly, and emerge changed. Five stars aren't enough; this is the stuff of legends.",
