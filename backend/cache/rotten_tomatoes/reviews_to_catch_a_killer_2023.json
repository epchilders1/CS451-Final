    "text": "Shailene Woodley is captivating and precise in this gritty search for a mass shooter.\n\nArgentine director Dami\u00e1n Szifron\u2019s crime mystery thriller To Catch a Killer (2023) is very enthralling. Szifron\u2019s direction is quite stylish and serious. There\u2019s a creepy atmosphere as mass shootings happen, the police gather evidence, and then the FBI seek out the killer. I kept trying to guess who the killer was and how they\u2019d figure him out. It\u2019s cool that Shailene Woodley got a producer credit here. She\u2019s absolutely fantastic and enthralling as the young detective, hopeful to get into the FBI.\n\nWriters Jonathan Wakeham and Dami\u00e1n Szifron do a great job of building suspense, creating chaotic shootings, crafting complex characters for both the police and the suspect, and providing tons of grim details. I was very impressed with how much detail there was to how police and detectives talk, agencies co-operate and impede investigations, and how the authorities attempt to narrow down their search. It\u2019s a very cool, realistic, and brutal movie with a clear vision. The acting is actually the standout with excellent performances from Shailene Woodley, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ralph Ineson.\n\nShailene Woodley is striking and compelling as beat cop Eleanor Falco, who has keen senses of observation. Woodley feels mature, serious, and concerned as the clever cop, who figures out the mass shooter by his psyche and clues. To Catch a Killer is some of Woodley\u2019s finest acting up there with The Fault in Our Stars, Big Little Lies, and The Descendents. She should lean into these great dramatic roles instead of her usual supporting roles.\n\nBen Mendelsohn is brilliant as the stern and guiding hand of the FBI lead agent Geoffrey Lammark. He\u2019s very coldhearted and clinical, but also manages to warm up to Woodley. Mendelsohn is very precise and detail oriented like Woodley\u2019s performance for real conversations and investigative tactics. Jovan Adepo is very good too as the other agent Jack Mackenzie.\n\nRalph Ineson is horrifying and poignant as the sorrowful mass shooter Dean Possey. He\u2019s very chilling, but you also understand why this guy\u2019s mindset fell so hard and how he became disillusioned with reality. Rosemary Dunsmore is unsettling as Mrs. Posse.\n\nEditor Dami\u00e1n Szifron\u2019s slow cuts and cinematographer Javier Julia\u2019s sleek visuals make for a crime thriller that lets the mystery gain tension. The lighting by Bruno Ferland and Andrei Cirnat looks sinister and stylish. I like the worn sets by production designer Jason Kisvarday. Composer Carter Burwell\u2019s score is full of menace, isolation, and anticipation. He knows how to write scary music that is still subtle. F\u00e9lix Larivi\u00e8re and Mathieu Latour\u2019s hairstyling for Shailene Woodley looks super cute.\n\nIn all, To Catch a Killer is unnerving and well crafted. We\u2019re given standout lead acting from actress Shailene Woodley and supporting players Ben Mendelsohn and Ralph Ineson.",

Unfortunately it fails to deliver on this promise, with an unrelatable antagonist, and a hero whose afflictions aren't properly explored. Worth a watch, just don't expect another Silence of the Lambs type of flick.",

Absolutely nothing that we haven't seen before, over and over again.\nThe acting is pretty solid, but the script is pretty terrible.\nPlus, whoever advised the director on operation tactics was pretty clueless. That and the ending could have so much better.",

What I found most interesting is it it's almost like a documentary in sense that it's very Realistic. The movie  makes you think\nHow does the killer think? What is there true motive? The movie showcase corrupted power Dynamic/ The incompetence of people. I mean, if you like things like Hannibal or criminal minds I think you might like it though it's less intense Then Hannibal Still an amazing movie if you like problem-solving Or thinking about Society issues it's a good watch.",
