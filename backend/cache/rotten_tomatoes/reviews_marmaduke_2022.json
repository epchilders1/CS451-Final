    "text": "Horrible.  The  human characters don't walk,they hop but my favorite part is the end credits part. so this is one out of 10 and why is the mom's butt so thicc? Why did the animators do that and almost like it was made 20 years ago. But I like the original one better, and all he does in 2022 is that he loves to fart, and eat,eat,eat,and eat!  \n\n I give this a rotten rating . So literally why? We owe Pete Davidson and J.K Simmons an apology! Netflix was a little crazy. And Netflix made this pretty choppy. Just chopped. Like the animation is pretty choppy. #1 hated movie.  0% good, 100% \ud83e\udd2e The 2010  version is better than this cat poo poo! \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e Pete should NOT have been in this cat poop! Same for JK Simmons! This is pure SLOP!",

    "text": "Marmaduke changed my life. Marmadukes character arc of going from a drug addict to savior of the city is insanely inspiring. My two-month old son got out of his chair and applauded until his hands fell off. The subplot with Omni-Man shook me to my core. Had me quaking in my boots. Now Pete Davidson took the already good performance of Owen Wilson in the live action movie and cranked it up to 67. \nHere let me show you guys the screenplay to one of the scenes.\n\n\nMarmaduke: NOO OMNI MAN WHY DID YOU KILL MY FAMILY GRRRRR\nOni mean: Are you sure?\nMarmaduke: yes their dead bodies are right there\nOn meme: Are you sure?\nMarmaduke: STOP TOYING WITH ME I WONT FALL FOR IT\nUNO man: Are you sure?\nMaramudke: Yes now shut up!!!!!!\nOmni ma\u2019am: Are you sure?\nMarmaduke: Alright I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to do this but I\u2019m bringing a CELEBRITY CAMEO\nMarkiplier: Hey everybody I\u2019m Market pliers and today we will be playing five nights at Freddy\u2019s\nOmmnom man:  Are you sure?\nMarket pliers: I\u2019m not dealing with this *Grabs Marmaduke and throws him at omniman, killing them both in a suicide bombing*\n\n\n10/10 movie but would not recommend to those faint of heart.",

    "text": "The movie is painfully so bad that critics gave it a zero and I can see why. That one scene where marmaduke  lets out a huge f*rt (I\u2019m censoring this because it\u2019s disgusting)  is really unnecessary and disgusting. This whole movie is disgusting, the humor is not funny, the animation is not that good and the story is just not great, it\u2019s bad. There are no emotional moments, there was one but I wouldn\u2019t call that emotional. I don\u2019t know what to say about the ost but it is mid.  I get that this is a kids film but kids don\u2019t deserve to watch this slop, they deserve something better, not a movie with unfunny and disgusting f*rt jokes. If you want to watch a film about pets or animals in general then I would recommend the Secret life of pets 1 and 2, the Garfield movie (2024), lilo and stitch or Madagascar (a actual funny film with no fart jokes). So yea, this movie is hot garbage.",

I mean the movie is so bad it seems like an NPC came up with the idea of creating it. This crap because this movie is so bad instead of the character winning a Chinese wins as if the Chinese care more and ridiculing the Mexicans I do not recommend it",

I am not using dog shampoo? Hmm, so so special. Yes come to the big show, come see the next world dog champion, Zuess. I like when he flooded the city I laughed really hard, and marmaduke is pretty. :) watch it",

My wife threatened to divorce me if i didn't stop sleeping with my Marmaduke body pillow every night, so of course i divorced her on the spot. Marmaduke's sheer beauty is only rivaled by Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison. also the story is cool or whatever. i could only give it 5 stars, but i would give Marmaduke 69 if i could.",
