Teve sequ\u00eancia I (2000), II (2001), III (2003), IV (2006), V (2013). Imitando os filmes \"P\u00e2nico\" e fazendo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 dela, mas diversos filmes de forma c\u00f4mica, tirando o sarro literalmente. E tendo Faris que s\u00f3 sua cara ja ganha a bilheteria, temos os irm\u00e3os Wayans de \"As Branquelas\" + Hall + Munro. Prepare a pipoca e a poltrona para dar boas gargalhadas e o mais improv\u00e1vel, ser\u00e1 seu maior a certo. kkkkkk \nVale apena assistir?: sim e com pipoca. E esta experi\u00eancia deu certo.\nNota: 8",

    "text": "The humor is outrageous, often leaning into slapstick, absurd dialogue, and adult jokes. Anna Faris stands out in her debut as Cindy Campbell, delivering a funny and surprisingly charming performance amid the chaos. The Wayans brothers bring their trademark energy and comic timing, making the film both ridiculous and entertaining from start to finish.",

The ridiculously intentional bad effects actually make the movie better.
