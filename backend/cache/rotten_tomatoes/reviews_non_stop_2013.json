Yes, it has all the thrills, suspense, and tension you get from his films. What I liked about this film was that it threw in a good dose of mystery as well. Liam has found his niche and does a very good job at it (like John Wayne). He plays the superhero without being \"super.\" I like how he underplays the role until he rises to the occasion when all is on the line. In the end, he is always underappreciated.",

All different people from different walks of life. You know not one person is the same so you can have more possibilities to shape their stories to make your own. Finally, the movie leaves you thinking this idea can happen in real life. But after watching this I would probably be more inclined to take the train.",
