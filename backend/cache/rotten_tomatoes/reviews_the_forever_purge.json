    "text": "Like its predecessors, The Forever Purge follows a familiar storyline \u2013 once a year for a twelve-hour period, Americans embark on a government-sanctioned crime spree.  However, this time around, the mayhem continues beyond the final buzzer as the Purge Purification Force attempts to exterminate those who they judge not to be \u2018pure\u2019 Americans.  Filled with a seemingly non-stop barrage of blood splatter and pyrotechnics, those who enjoy non-stop barrages of blood splatter and pyrotechnics will no doubt get a kick out of it.  Those who prefer something a little more sedate should look elsewhere\u2026or maybe just settle for the original The Purge (which is actually pretty decent) and accept the fact that all that follow the first instalment are pretty much the same and probably don\u2019t require viewing.",

    "text": "Contrived, confusing, idiotic and harebrained this mind numbing exercise in  incomprehensible tedium has no idea what it it wants to say. This is the least suspenseful and scary of the Purge films and is poorly directed with bare minimum effort. The messaging is ham-fisted when it isn't puzzling and the actors range from mediocre to terrible. The female lead does a decent enough job in her role but she too is poorly written just like everybody else in this film. This film is a catastrophic waste of time and a new low for the horror genre as a whole. Don't fry your brain cells watching this incompetent trash.",

    "text": "While I enjoyed the first three Purge films and disliked \"The First Purge,\" I didn't have high expectations for this latest installment, and unfortunately, it was disappointing. The first half was lackluster, and the second half was overly predictable. It was clear that the Mexican character, who fell in love with the American guy's sister, would be killed. Additionally, during the climax, when they ran out of ammunition, they were hiding behind a bus in an open field and still managed to escape, which seemed unrealistic. Overall, the movie didn't bring anything new to the table, and I wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "The Purge Goes Global: A Wildly Entertaining \"Forever Purge\"\n\n\"The Forever Purge\" takes the franchise to a whole new level, ditching the single-night format for a relentless fight for survival in a world gone mad.  This final installment delivers amped-up action, social commentary with a punch, and a surprising amount of heart. \n\nEverardo Gout's direction is sharp and stylish, creating a constant sense of danger and paranoia.  The film throws our heroes, the seemingly ordinary Juarez family, into a desperate struggle against a new breed of purgers \u2013 those who believe the purge should never end.  The cast shines, with Ana de la Reguera and Tenoch Huerta bringing fierce determination and relatable vulnerability to their roles as Adela and Juan. \n\nWhile the action is relentless, the film doesn't shy away from its core themes.  The concept of a \"Forever Purge\" acts as a chilling metaphor for the rise of extremism and the dangers of unchecked violence.  The film cleverly explores themes of immigration, class warfare, and the fight for a better tomorrow.\n\nBeyond the action and social commentary, \"The Forever Purge\" also surprises with its moments of genuine connection.  The bond between the Juarez family and their unlikely allies forms the emotional core of the film.  These moments of humanity amidst the chaos make the fight for survival all the more compelling.\n\nThis isn't your typical Purge movie.  It's a wild ride with a bigger scope, a more desperate fight, and a surprising amount of heart.  \"The Forever Purge\" is a worthy send-off for the franchise, leaving audiences breathless, exhilarated, and pondering the dangers of a world that embraces violence.",
