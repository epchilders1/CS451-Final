    "text": "El caso de Jennifer Pan es una historia cruel que me impact\u00f3. Desde el primer acto vi a Jennifer culpable, no fue dif\u00edcil de suponer con una postura de muchos nervios e incoherencia en sus declaraciones, que aumenta a medida que avanzan los interrogatorios.\nMe gust\u00f3 el inicio, con un ritmo calmado pero que me mantuvo atento, a pesar de, no lo sent\u00ed aburrido. Me gust\u00f3 la puesta en escena de la directora y algunos de los aspectos en el montaje, es lo que m\u00e1s destaca en toda la pel\u00edcula.\nEl gui\u00f3n es su punto fr\u00e1gil, el tercer acto es realmente voluble, un cl\u00edmax sin intensidad, no transmite sensaci\u00f3n de resoluci\u00f3n, me produjo m\u00e1s dudas que respuestas.\nEl desenlace es realmente intrascendente, lo que produjo una sensaci\u00f3n de que pude haber encontrado esta informaci\u00f3n en cualquier otro lugar, no hubo un cierre que me hiciera pensar, reflexionar, o cuestionarme, solo un cierre de una historia.\nHabr\u00eda estado genial profundizar m\u00e1s en los aspectos psicol\u00f3gicos de Jennifer, alg\u00fan testimonio de un forense, contextualizar m\u00e1s en el lugar de los hechos o evidencias, as\u00ed como los padres, o el velorio del cual Jennifer tambi\u00e9n forma parte, sin necesidad de caer en morbo.\nAlgunos de los entrevistados son realmente innecesarios, ya que la informaci\u00f3n que sus testimonios no tienen gran relevancia en el desarrollo de la historia.\nPercib\u00ed el cierre muy apresurado y general, sobre el juicio y participaci\u00f3n de los medios no hay mucho que decir, pr\u00e1cticamente nada.\nEs una pel\u00edcula que puedes ver sin problema, si te gustan los documentales de cr\u00edmenes reales y todav\u00eda no lo has visto, no es mal plan para cerrar un domingo tranqui en casa.",

    "text": "\"What Jennifer Did\" is a true crime film that dives into the chilling case of Jennifer Pan, who calls 911 to report her parents have been shot, only to become the primary suspect. As a true crime enthusiast, I appreciated the film's commitment to authenticity, particularly its use of real interrogation footage, which added a gripping layer of realism. Watching Jennifer's demeanor shift under questioning was a fascinating glimpse into the psychological intricacies of the case.\n\nHowever, despite its compelling start, the film falls short in terms of unpredictability. The narrative unfolds in a predictable manner, lacking the shocking twists or noteworthy revelations that often define the genre. The storytelling felt linear and straightforward, which made it easy to foresee the film\u2019s key developments. As a result, it didn't quite deliver the suspenseful experience I look for in true crime stories.\n\nOverall, \"What Jennifer Did\" is a solid watch for those interested in true crime, but it doesn\u2019t break new ground. It offers an intriguing yet unsurprising look into a well-known case, making it worth watching for the real footage but not necessarily for the narrative depth or unexpected turns. I\u2019d give it three stars.",
