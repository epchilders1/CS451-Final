    "text": "A film that pretty much has everything; winning both Picture & Director seems very possible, if not likely. Disagree with criticism of how Perfidia is portrayed: Taylor's character is critical to much of what transpires on screen, and PTA makes clear which side we should be rooting for, and she so clearly lives on through her daughter (Infiniti is wonderful). Perhaps Penn's character comes off as a bit too campy, but that's the point: these men are indeed ridiculous and downright silly, but simultaneously very dangerous because they have the powerful and their foot soldiers (i.e. the US government) on their side.",

It\u2019s a movie that makes me wonder why we are subjected to ridiculous movies in the last 5/10 years.  Its hyperbolic, overly exaggerated attempt to encompass compassion with recent events was laughable.",

And that they didn\u2019t break the law because\u2026 well, it just happened, they didn\u2019t mean to. Which is essentially deceptive.\n\nWell, anyway, I hope that the president\u2019s administration and ICE will finish their work, and we won\u2019t see many more films like this.",

    "text": "One Battle After Another is easily one of the best films of the year. From start to finish, the movie delivers powerful storytelling, emotional weight, and performances that stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is, as always, fully in his bag\u2014commanding every scene with intensity, vulnerability, and the kind of layered acting only he can deliver. His portrayal feels lived-in and deeply human.\n\nBut one of the biggest standouts is Teyana Taylor, who continues to prove she\u2019s one of the most versatile and underrated talents working today. She brings incredible range, depth, and raw emotion, elevating every moment she\u2019s on screen and matching DiCaprio beat for beat.\n\nThe movie balances action, drama, and heart seamlessly, making it easy to recommend to almost anyone. If you\u2019re looking for a gripping film with top-tier acting, this is absolutely the one to watch.",
