    "text": "This film was by far one of Mr. Tyler's best films! From the cast to the details of their emotions. lIt's one thing to act but to feel but it's completely different when it actually moves you. The rotten reviews come from those critics that have dust on their baseboards but if you visit their home you sneeze uncontrollably. They lack real vision but are full of opinions. This movie is my favorite of all time! Mr. Tyler I know your mama is beyond proud for the production this film.",

The entire casts performance, you could tell meant more than words to portray such an incredible story! \nIf you want a story that inspires as well as entertains, this film is certainly for you.",

It was very well made, and taught me something from the past that I had no idea about. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen it, and would definitely watch it again. I recommend watching it if you\u2019ve got a movie night on your radar.",

Much of the issues could have been averted if Gov't/Military standardized communication by understanding the the variables of communicating during war. Some similarities still prevalent today.",

    "text": "The Six Triple Eight is the story of the only black Women's Army Corps to serve in the European theater during WWII. It was a compelling story, enhanced by a touching interracial love story. Some critics did not feel as if it was dramatic enough, and did not like the love story. However, if you like Pearl Harbor or Titanic, chances are you will like this film. On the other hand, if you prefer more gritty, realistic historical dramas, such as Saving Private Ryan, you may not like this film.  In other words, if prefer your  history lessons wrapped up with some romantic tension, you will like this Tyler Perry drama. Recommended.",

    "text": "Fantastic movie that (finally!) recognises this battalion of female soldiers who, with a phenomenal amount of grit and resilience, proved so many mysogynistic bigots/racists wrong when they are given a mission with an intent for them to fail. \n\nWhilst I would have preferred less focus on the romance suggested in this movie (which may or may not be fictional), it does not take away from the real story, which is that these women did something the army thought to be unachievable, and rose above every bit of adversity deliberately (and sometimes cruelly) thrown at them - in almost half the time they were given. The actors in the main roles were amazing, particularly Kerry Washington, Ebony Obsidian and Dean Norris (who played his character so well, he made me despise him!).",

    "text": "It's not bad for what it's worth but I questions if a 2 hour film was the best way to do something like this rather than a 1 hour documentary. The problem is the editing is just alright and story wise it's just very unfocused. We bounce around between multiple subplots. Romances, racial tensions, bombs, individual stories, and the core sorting mail plot all feel very scattered. It feels like it's telling the events that happened but not in a cohesive manner. The cinematography is alright. Some scenes look better than others and Perry's direction is decent here. Some scenes are very melodramatic, over the top, repetitive and there are some that do a decent job of character drama. The production value is pretty good but the whole thing has like what I can only describe as like a borderline hallmark Channel vibe to it. Which isn't a bad thing but it makes it feel out of place when we go for serious racial subjects or dark scenes. Everything else though is half decent. Everyone is trying here but the characters do all blend in a bit and it gets a bit hard to keep track of everyone besides the Lt Col. And I do like the subject manner. You know we see how many WWII flicks of D-Day, Pearl Harbor, Stalingrad, and Iwo Jima but I can't tell you of many where a unique subject like this is covered. It is a interesting perspective and the end homage was sweet and the best part to the ladies of the unit. But it feels like the racial parts are very on the nose, get repetitive, and add on the unfocused subplots and it just gets a bit boring honestly. But again it's still not half bad just because it's such a unique subject manner. Anyone who wants to see a unique WWII subject manner or is a fan of any actors in this may want to check this out.",

I know a film isn't a documentary but anything like this that shines a light on a piece of important black women's history is worth seeing just to make you think. You can do the research afterwards. \n\nPlus it's a good film telling an uplifting story. I was recommended it by a friend and I will pass on the favour. Just because the film critics didn't like it very much, well, ignore them and watch this film.",
