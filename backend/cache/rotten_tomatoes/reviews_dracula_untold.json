    "text": "Dracula Untold was released in theatres in 2014 and stars Luke Evans as Vlad the Impaler (Vlad Tepes) and Charles Dance as sort of the Master Vampire. It's set in the 15th century and Evans is the ruler of Wallachia. The Turkish army invades Transylvania demanding tribute including his son. Evans refuses and seeks the master vampire's help who had earlier killed some of his best soldiers. Dance offers Vlad his blood which will give him the power of a vampire, but he can return to normal if he doesn't drink any human blood. Vlad uses his new abilities to turn a number of his soldiers into vampires and they defeat the Turks. But when his soldiers want to attack the villagers and his son he allows the sunlight to destroy them. The movie ends with Vlad in present day being watched by the master vampire. Luke Evans gave a solid performance, the CGI was good, and I liked the dark atmosphere. I think an 'R' rating would have helped but overall it was a decent Dracula movie and certainly worth a watch.",

    "text": "Dracula Untold stands out because it\u2019s stylish, fast, and full of energy. The visuals are sharp, the action hits hard, and the bat transformations look incredible. Luke Evans brings real presence to the role, making Dracula feel powerful and commanding. It blends medieval war, dark fantasy, and myth in a really cool way, and the movie keeps a strong, cinematic momentum from start to finish. It\u2019s a fun, visually striking, badass take on the Dracula legend.",

Nowadays, new movies are being taken with complexion and failed to reach its profit in collection wise. The simple flow of movie is being forgotten and that's is why ,any movies sequels after the first one does not perform very well.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Dracula movies. It's very entertaining, beautifully shot, with phenomenal acting. It may not be the exact story of Dracula but it's a really good story. Don't trust these scores on rotten tomato because alot of them are just way off. I mean, Nosferatu got high scores and that's a pile of garbage...  There definitely needs to a second movie to this. I absolutely hate and don't understand why  studios listen to these lame critics. They are obviously being paid to give certain scores, which are almost every time, just wrong.  Listen to the people that actually spend money to watch your films and do so for entertainment, not to push a certain view or paid to give wrong scores. Hollywood still hasn't learned to listen to the people and they and us are losing out because of it.",
