And I love cheesy Christmas movies. \n\nI know everyone is throwing shade at the acting but you've got a relatively solid cast and a TIKTOK skit quality movie. \n\nThat's a writing problem. \n\nThat being said, I'm continuing to watch it because I'm masochistic and hate myself.",

Melissa Joan Hart whose company produced this film is under used. \n\nPierson Fode is actually quite good with his limited role, he is one to look out for, hopefully he will make the move to serious movies, he has the looks to match Ryan Gosling and Chris Hemsworth, lets hope he can find an indie to show his acting chops.\n\nJameela Jamil did okay as well she has more screen time than Fode but is stuck in the role of the 'other woman' and isn't given much to do with it and unfortunately doesn't make the role a memorable one.\n\nOverall just very bland not one of Netflix's better Christmas movies.",

And Chet is a laff riot!! I feel some negative reviews must come from young people just setting out to change the world. Just remember, the grass is always greener on the path not taken.",

Zero Christmas charm. \n\nThe beginning of the film promises a newly divorced woman in her late 40s claiming her life back from her awful husband now her youngest kid is grown. She gave up her dream job to live in a small town and in her words, basically be a single parent for 20 years. Her ex treats his new girlfriend like trash and wins his wife back by thanking her for making him the kind of man that could be a good husband and father for someone else? She gives up a second chance at her dream job in a new city to stay with the man who only wanted her after she was finally getting out. \n\nThe acting feels as though everyone got their lines the morning of filming.",

Once you\u2019ve seen the trailer, you\u2019ve seen the best bits. It\u2019s really not that funny, it\u2019s not that entertaining and it\u2019s not that moving.
