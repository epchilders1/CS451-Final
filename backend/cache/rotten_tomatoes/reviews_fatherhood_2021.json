    "text": "Fatherhood is a heartfelt drama-comedy based on Matthew Logelin\u2019s real-life memoir, portraying his journey as a single father after losing his wife shortly after childbirth. While the film takes creative liberties\u2014like altering family dynamics and character meetings\u2014to heighten emotional tension, it stays true to the core story and emotional depth. Kevin Hart\u2019s compelling performance brings humor and sincerity to the role, making the film a touching and relatable tribute to love, grief, and fatherhood.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)",

    "text": "Fatherhood - 8/10. Paul Weitz directs this sweet and honest film about single parenthood based on a memoir by Matthew Logelin. With an incredibly honest performance from Kevin Hart, this film does an amazing job of showcasing the comedian in a different type of way, outside of his usual goofiness. The story follows his character as he deals with the loss of his wife after giving birth, and how he raises his daughter through many of the trials and tribulations that any single parent would face. A simple, yet engaging story thanks to the performances of the cast, Fatherhood is a perfect example of creating a beautiful film out of something predictable and familiar. Though the film feels familiar, it feels very down to earth thanks to the performance of Hart. He plays the character with this earnest quality, and his energy is played at the right level throughout the film. His trademark humour is there, but at the same time he also gives the character a depth that many seasoned actors are not able to give. Its wonderful to see him act like this, as this film and The Upside show that he is well capable of making good films with good performances. For director Weitz, this feels like a nice throwback to another amazing film that he had earlier directed (the wonderful About A Boy). He gives the film a nice pace and does a great great job of showcasing all of the performances and framing scenes with a nice mix of comedy and drama. A nice film, though familiar, Fatherhood is a good dramedy that will lift your heart and also makes you appreciate all that parents go through.",

    "text": "Lo siento, pero Ser padre ha sido una experiencia decepcionante. La pel\u00edcula, protagonizada por Kevin Hart en el papel principal, intenta tocar el coraz\u00f3n del espectador con una historia emotiva sobre la paternidad, pero se queda atrapada en un guion plano y predecible que no logra profundizar en las emociones que promete. Aunque el tema tiene potencial, el enfoque es tan formulaico que las escenas clave parecen dise\u00f1adas \u00fanicamente para buscar la l\u00e1grima f\u00e1cil, sin realmente gan\u00e1rsela.\n\nKevin Hart, conocido por su destreza en la comedia, demuestra carisma en ciertos momentos, pero no consigue convencer en las partes dram\u00e1ticas. Su interpretaci\u00f3n carece de la autenticidad y vulnerabilidad necesarias para transmitir el peso emocional de la historia, haciendo que muchas escenas se sientan forzadas o poco cre\u00edbles. La qu\u00edmica con Melody Hurd, quien interpreta a su hija, tiene destellos de ternura, pero no logra sostener la trama debido a la superficialidad del guion. Alfre Woodard, en el rol de la suegra, aporta una actuaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lida, pero su presencia se siente subutilizada en un guion que no le da mucho con qu\u00e9 trabajar.\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos t\u00e9cnicos, la pel\u00edcula no presenta nada particularmente destacable, ni en su direcci\u00f3n a cargo de Paul Weitz, ni en su banda sonora, que parecen m\u00e1s preocupadas por seguir el manual del g\u00e9nero que por aportar algo \u00fanico. La relaci\u00f3n padre-hija tiene momentos genuinos, pero incluso estos destellos se ven opacados por el ritmo pesado de la narrativa.\n\nSer padre podr\u00eda haber sido una exploraci\u00f3n sincera y conmovedora de la paternidad y el duelo, pero se conforma con ser un drama tibio que no arriesga ni sorprende. En lugar de emocionarte, te deja con la sensaci\u00f3n de haber visto algo m\u00e1s enfocado en cumplir con los clich\u00e9s que en contar una historia que realmente importe.",

    "text": "I see people saying it's formulaic.  I think that is if you look at the overview and categorize it, ok.  Put it in a box. For a moment take it out of this box,  if you look at the minutia, there is charm, relatability, humanity.  The reason it is possibly perceived as  formulaic is because people have these things happen to them irl over and over. Struggle in real life is real.  We sure do need stories of love and the complexity of love. Seeing others experience and cope through storytelling can offer hope irl. I'll be redundant, unexpected loss and how to cope are REAL relatable, vulnerable issues. And in a culture that does not date talk about grief and death a movie can offer catharsis.  Hope and humor is powerful. Do not underplay hope and humor.   It can sometimes be the only fuel that keeps someone going through the darkest of times.   The acting is hands down genuine and believable.  I was immersed.",
