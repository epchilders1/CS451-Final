    "text": "The story behind the Titan sub disaster is tragic and definitely worth telling, but this doc drags more than it should. It\u2019s competently made and covers the basics; Stockton Rush\u2019s ego, ignored safety warnings, and how preventable the whole thing was, but it just doesn\u2019t stay engaging the whole time. I felt like I got the point about 45 minutes in, and then it kept going.\n\nThat said, I really feel for the families. The doc does make you sit with the human cost, which matters. I just wish it had been tighter and less repetitive. It\u2019s solid background if you don\u2019t know much about the incident, but not something I\u2019d rewatch or strongly recommend.",

The entire crew did a great job on telling this story about the OceanGate disaster that killed five people in a submersible that was created to see the Titanic underwater. It's a story about a man obsessed with fame and ignoring anything that could jeopardize it. If you haven't seen this documentary yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",

The company didn't record anything from the last dive? that is impossible. How were the people on the surface experienced the implosion, how did the passengers arrived in the ship, interviews with them, how they entered the titan? etc.. there should be tons of material available but we didn't see any of it.",

The dreadful arrogance that led to the tragedy could inspire a Hollywood disaster movie, but this documentary approach is better and more respectful to the victims. The silencing of naysayers and whistleblowers over several years is both shocking and numbing but brings a kind of explanation to it all.",

Not to be viewed as a blockbuster summer flick, but as an engaging history lesson. Really enjoyed the research, narrative, and tone of the doc. It is verry fitting to the tragedy it represents.

    "text": "Netflix should really stay out of the business of making documentaries. Every single doc the make follows the same lousy script: interview a few ppl (this is the core), throw in as much emotion as possible and drag it, jump all over the place and feed the audience pieces of facts delivered incoherently. Is this the new Gen Z way of making \u201cdocumentaries\u201d? I binged many youtube videos and other sources when this tragedy unfolded, this \u201cdoc\u201d left out many interesting details, conversations and technicalities. It barely even covers the last dive and search operation. It really feels like a lazy presentation of this story all done by the interviewees and close to 0 created by the makers doing further research. I also just finished watching the Astroworld doc, which is just as poorly made.",

The documentary drags on with a long-winded buildup and barely scratches the surface of the most critical part: the implosion itself. No details on the last communications, how the surviving surface crew was reapinding when the vessel went missing, or how the wreckage was actually found. It skips over the most tragic, intense, and revealing moments. Why make a documentary like this and ignore the heart of the story? Sadly, this was a waste of time.",

While it sheds light on the mysteries of the event that captivated the world for about 5 days, it really is a compelling, cautionary tale stranger than fiction that shows the pitfalls of hubris, the comfort of generational wealth and the invisible hand of fate. \n\n\u201cAerospace engineer\u201d Richard \u201cStockton\u201d Rush. Seemingly buys his way through college and one day decides he wants to be the next James Cameron or Elon Musk and use his wealth and \u201cengineering background\u201d to philanthropically \u201copen the ocean to humanity\u201d with a for-profit tour company open only to those with means equal to his own. All the while showing the mindset of anyone with means and an ego to match. Narcissistic, manipulative, crooked and vindictive, Rush will let no one and nothing get in his way until he is literally crushed under the weight of his own hubris.",

It is chaotic, without any merit and forcing cheap emotion. There are way better videos online made by a single youtuber. The worst part there is not even really any good information what have happened? There are just bits and pieces that are not coherent. I think this topic deserve way way more.",
