    "text": "The Gray Man is a very mixed movie for me even though I really wanted to like it.\n\nI knew about its reputation, but went in hopeful because I liked the films the Russos, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus made before. This one bleeds from several wounds. First of all the story is generic despite the pretty cool premise. If a mocie has a premise similar to this, I'm going to watch, but you have got to inject something fresh, something unexpected into it to make it intriguing. The characters are generic too with almost nothing interesting. The dialogues are sometimes painfully unnatural. It's also written like it couldn't be shot practically under like $500 million. There are too many locations and over the top actions sequences. Because of that these actions sequences don't really hold value or stakes.\n\nThe directing is mixed. Maybe I only say this because of their previous work, but this feels like it wants to be a superhero movie. Every other shot wants to be epic. It's just not fitting. I loved the direction of the first two scenes, which made me very hopeful for the rest of the film. But as I said, it was quite a downhill from that. The lighting would be pretty good, but the constantly noticable CGI just overwhelmed me. The editing is not too good, as I said there are too many locations and they cut between them incredibly fast, but it's still boeing. The score is pretty good at times. The cast is great and the acting is okay.\n\nThe Gray Man is sadly as bad as they say.",

Only reason I watched this was because it was highly rated but I have to leave my first review. If you're looking for good cinema you won't find it here.",

When I finished it, I was like, \"man, that was pretty underwhelming.\" The plot was very generic and predictable, some of the characters were useless, and even some things had me questioning if it was cool. I will say the cast performances were really good. Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas did well. Just everything else was very average.",

How many times do you want to repeat the \"mortally wounded person does a thing\" trope? Surely not 3 times in the same film. I almost fell asleep during one of the action set pieces. I miss the days when Ryan Gosling only made cool films.",
