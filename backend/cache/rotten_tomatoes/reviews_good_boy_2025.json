    "text": "A brave dog, \"Indy\" (as himself) fights to protect the one he loves most Shane Jensen as \"Todd\" in \"Good Boy\".\nIt\u2019s a unique horror movie from the perspective and point of view of a dog.\nAlso starring Larry Fessenden as \"Grandpa\" and Arielle Friedman as \"Todd\u2019s\" sister \"Vera\" and more straight out of central casting.\n\nHowever, this film is not about the human actors.\nIn fact, you barely see their faces in a \"Toy Story\" style.\nThis is not an animation or a child friendly flick.\n\n\"Good Boy\" is suspenseful, dark and haunting.\n\nDespite the supernatural horror you\u2019ve got to admire this feature film directorial debut of Ben Leonberg and his sense of humour for naming his production company \"What\u2019s Wrong With Your Dog\".\n\nTheres nothing wrong with \"Indy\", but it\u2019s long been studied that dogs have a sixth sense about danger.\n\nTheres a few genuine jump scares in the short 72 minute runtime that took 400 days to shoot, but you are working with the directors own dog and he is a better actor than half of Hollywood. \n\nIt\u2019s a very different experience to your normal run of the mill horror movie and it really ramps up in the third act for our protagonist.\n\nFun fact: \"Indy\" is a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever who will play fetch with you till your arms fall off.\n\nWatch out for: ancient carvings on the basement staircase.\n\nSaying goodbye to my little man \"Henry\" in May this year brought the story even closer to home.\nI remember him always seeing things around our home that us humans failed to although we\u2019ve felt and even heard strange things.\nYou'll fall in love with \"Indy\" and want to give him an Oscar!\n\nStreaming on Shudder through Prime.",

They do what they are told. I get the feeling that Indy got a lot of mixed messages making this film. Anyway, it was interesting since it was from Indy's perspective.",

    "text": "\u201cGood Boy\u201d manages to acheive something extraordinary: a well-executed, ultra-low-budget haunted house movie with an actual living, breathing dog as the protagonist.\nThe story covers some well-trodden horror/suspense ground and the human performances are somewhat hampered by a clunky script.\nHowever, the utterly believable performance of Indy the dog give is the backbone of this movie. One of the best dog performances I have ever seen put to film. You will find yourself wanting to reach into the screen and hug him. He is, in every possible way, a Good Boy.",

My son felt the same way. One good thing was how the dog was looking back at the right time and all that, but ridiculous, mixed-up story.",

No unbearable undeserved ego or cringe. \n\nThese bone heads could actually learn from Indy. \nThe film has some pretty creepy moments. There are a couple good and genuinely frightening jump scares. \n\nIt's also a very sad film. How the dog is dealing with its owner's suffering was a bit of a tear jerker. Wasn't expecting much depth from this film. It is worth a watch.",

The one thing that is missing from the other reviews that I saw is that it is a terribly sad movie, particularly if you have lost someone to cancer. Unfortunately, I have lost several. It really hits home. Indy is so expressive and intelligent, and wants so much to understand it all and to help. Just heartbreaking.  I wanted to take the good boy home and comfort him! A very lovable main character.",
