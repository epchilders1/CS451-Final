    "text": "Time Trap? More Like Time I\u2019ll Never Get Back\n\nIf I had the power to time travel, I\u2019d go back to the exact moment before I pressed play on this movie and slap the remote out of my own hand. Time Trap is the cinematic equivalent of a lukewarm gas station hot dog  looks kind of interesting at first, but you instantly regret the experience.\n\nThe plot stumbles around like it\u2019s lost in its own time loop, the pacing is somehow both rushed and painfully slow, and the characters make choices so brainless I started rooting for the cave to seal itself shut. And then there\u2019s Cara\u2026 easily one of the worst performances I\u2019ve seen in years. Every line delivery sounded like she was reading a grocery list, and every reaction felt like she was realizing she left the oven on at home. If bad acting were a competition, she\u2019d be a time-traveling champion.\n\nBy the end, I wasn\u2019t just bored I was angry that no time machine exists in real life to undo this mistake. File this movie under \u201cDo Not Watch Unless Trapped in a Cave With No Other Entertainment.",

    "text": "I get it. It\u2019s B movie acting. But I knew that going in and I love anything with time travel and sci-fi elements. That being said, I\u2019ve watched it several times because it\u2019s such a unique premise that has a neat and satisfying ending. Time dilation is a rare subject for a movie so while this isn\u2019t necessarily the best execution, it\u2019s quirky enough to justify cult status in time travel cinema. It was better than I thought it would be going in, and strangely, I find myself going back for more viewings to see if I missed anything. That\u2019s a testament to a good movie! Can we get a sequel?! lol",

    "text": "Time Trap is a fun, intriguing sci-fi adventure with an ingenious central premise\u2014but while the ideas are fantastic, the execution doesn\u2019t quite match their full potential.\n\nThe story follows a group of students searching for their missing professor, only to stumble upon a mysterious cave where time moves at drastically different speeds. This high-concept setup immediately hooks the viewer, and as the characters delve deeper, the film cleverly unravels layers of history and time anomalies, leading to some genuinely mind-bending reveals.\n\nUnfortunately, while the film\u2019s visual storytelling and sci-fi elements shine, its simplistic dialogue, uneven pacing, and flat character development hold it back. The characters often feel like they exist just to push the plot forward, rather than fully fleshed-out individuals we can invest in. Additionally, the film introduces some incredible ideas\u2014ancient civilizations, futuristic beings, and time distortions\u2014but doesn\u2019t fully explore them, leaving a sense of what could have been.\n\nThat said, Time Trap is still a fun, thought-provoking watch. Despite its meandering execution, it\u2019s a great film for fans of low-budget indie sci-fi who enjoy high-concept time travel mysteries like Coherence or Triangle.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Verdict: A brilliant sci-fi concept, wrapped in a film that is engaging but lacks depth and polish. Worth a watch for time-travel fans, but don\u2019t expect a masterpiece. 3/5 stars! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

    "text": "The movie is A class for a C grade low budget sci-fi movie. It combines many elements that somewhat fit well in the narrative it portrays. Some of the execution however leaves much to be desired, as most of the scenes were cut in post production to fit the time allotted for these kind of movies. The acting and script were as expected for a low budget film, however the casting of characters were on point in my opinion. The Science fiction side was surprisingly good, and gave a dazzling array of detail that is enough to intrigue the viewer.",

This isn\u2019t a Hollywood quality blockbuster, but it is a highly creative and original thriller that will keep you guessing. To be critical, the plot and acting weren\u2019t amazing, but it gave the movie a cult-classic type feel that absolutely charmed me by the end of the film. I literally made an account to leave this review because I genuinely believe it deserves more credit.",

If there is ONE redeeming quality about this movie it was the superb acting abilities of Furby. Sarcasm. The concept would have been amazing if it were directed by non-Mormons. Very Wrinkle in Time. If the acting was remotely passable. I want them to remake this.  Correction - They as in whoever made this version should make G rated kids shows for Disney.  The dialogue is SO BAD. Someone ELSE should remake this concept and scrap the script. \n\nStraight up I will never get that time back.",

A collage professor investigates a disappearance then, becomes lost himself. His students follow up only to become similarly ensnared. It starts out OK but becomes sillier as the plot develops\u2014including a hilariously goofy band of cavemen-savages. The actors are attractive, but not strong enough as characters to make us care much about their fate. Also, animal lovers will wonder what happened to \u201cBoss\u201d!",
