    "text": "Aqui, a franquia tem seu primeiro trope\u00e7o. A aventura \u00e9 empolgante, a anima\u00e7\u00e3o continua linda e a com\u00e9dia ousada segue sendo um dos grandes acertos da s\u00e9rie, especialmente com a inclus\u00e3o de Buck, o personagem mais divertido de toda a franquia. Por\u00e9m, os problemas superam os acertos. A Era do Gelo 3 apresenta a ideia mais interessante de toda a saga \u2014 um novo universo habitado por dinossauros \u2014 e at\u00e9 consegue explor\u00e1-la bem em alguns momentos, mas n\u00e3o o suficiente para corresponder ao seu potencial. O filme desperdi\u00e7a tempo que poderia ser usado para desenvolver essa narrativa com cenas e subtramas in\u00fateis. Al\u00e9m disso, n\u00e3o encontra motiva\u00e7\u00f5es consistentes para todos os personagens: Diego, por exemplo, fica perdido no enredo com um arco que n\u00e3o faz sentido frente ao que havia constru\u00eddo nos filmes anteriores. A trilha sonora \u00e9 apenas competente e, no fim, todos os acertos j\u00e1 foram feitos de forma melhor nos longas anteriores. No geral, A Era do Gelo 3 diverte e empolga, mas est\u00e1 muito abaixo do que a franquia \u00e9 capaz de entregar. Nota 6/10.",

    "text": "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the best of the 3 films! It has a character named Buck and he was hilarious, and the story in my opinion is actually very engaging! The characters were also likeable, but for Crash and Eddie, screw them! But overall, the third installment of the Ice Age franchise in my opinion is absolutely one of the best movies Blue Sky Studios has put out there!!!",

    "text": "Another exciting instalment to the franchise, centred around another extinct species, dinosaurs.\n\nIt does get different from what other Ice Age stories bring out: it is sad that Diego was plotting to leave when Ellie was about to have her child. But soon, the story gets crazy when Sid takes 3 dinosaur eggs to look after as his own & is taken by the mother dinosaur into the lost world of dinosaurs, now that is the most adventurous Ice Age movie.\n\nAnd another unique story was that Scrat had forgotten about the nut & fell for a female (Scratte) who also wanted a nut too.\n\nWe are also introduced to a popular Ice Age character, Buck Wilde, who was enemies with Rudy since he broke out his tooth & Buck lost an eye.\n\nThe best line was when Manny said \"I LIKED YOU GUYS BETTER WHE YOU WERE EXTINCT!\" since there is not so much sense that dinosaurs existed at the same time as animals of the Ice Age. And speaking of Manny, it was lovely to see their daughter, Peaches (sweet, round & covered with fuzz) being born. CAUTION: When you thought that the franchise should have ended there, you are forgetting the one scene in the first movie that shows the next 2 were happening in general.",

    "text": "A significant improvement over 2. The characters move the plot, the villain is actually set-up and 100 more intimidating. Sid finally gets some emotional moments with the dinos. Manny, Ellie and Peaches subplot is beautiful. The comedy is actually great, and Buck is an amazing addition, the possums aren't as annoying as in any other installment. This movie is actually decent!",
