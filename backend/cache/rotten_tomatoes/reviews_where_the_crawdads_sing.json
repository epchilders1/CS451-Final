    "text": "How on earth did the critics give this just 34%? It baffles me. This film has so many elements to it. A solid story that is unique. A sad start to life for the protagonist, herself developing into a strong, complex, multi-faceted character. The beautiful backdrop of the marsh. Really solid acting all round. A story so beautifully romantic. Interesting court room drama. A twist in the tale. I've seen it twice and have had tears in my eyes both times and I'm hardly a soft, maudling person myself. Watch this film. Watch it again in a few years. Recommend it to your friends and family. And finally, don't forget to watch it with your lover.",

    "text": "This story of a young woman's survival living outside the norms of conventional society is gripping from start to end. Part courtoom drama, this beautifully filmed story goes deep into the psyche and experiences of Kya, the \"Marsh Girl\",  eminently portayed by Daisy Edgar-Jones. Her survival of abuse and abandonment comes from her relationship with nature, until she goes on trial  acused of murder.",

After glancing at the professional reviews, I thought I would end up watching ten minutes before relegating the rest to the web abyss. Actually, the movie raises a pretty solid argument. The protagonist is attractive, but not a 10/10. The case of a poor little girl left alone to figure a way to survive is described quite convincingly. David Strathairn plays well the sympathetic lawyer who is trying to save her life. In the end, we have a revelation that changes our previous impressions.\nAnd a nice Taylor Swift song with the end credits (again, not a big fan) with lyrics directly referencing the plot.",
