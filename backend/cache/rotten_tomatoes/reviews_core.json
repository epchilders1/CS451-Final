They had a discord mod giving them comms. The cgi was better in 1273BCE. This made my WWII grandpa traumatized. Watching paint dry would have been better than this. This made me want to get a job. If I had the option between going to Afghanistan and watching this a second time, I would go to Afghanistan in a heartbeat. Originally my fantasy football league punishment was a buzz cut, now I think we might change it to watching this movie.",

    "text": "This movie is fantastic. That is what it is. In the original sense of the word. Fantastic. The director, gaffers , actors , etc. they knew what this movie was: a Clich\u00e8 disaster movie. But by god does it strike a chord within myself that every time I see it streaming that I buy a crate of 5% beer and just tune in to this film. The acting is top. It is believable. The physics of the film is only bad as they get through the mantle. I can understand that the rest of the film is all speculation, as if it was made of cheese! What does it matter !?!?!? It\u2019s a film. 2001: A Space Odyssey has a massive baby? As much as it is an amazing film, sometimes I like just dirt disaster. 80IQ and sitting in front of the television with large amounts of alcohol, my girlfriend sitting besides me equally as drunk. Probably shouting \u2018why has Hilary Swank got such lovely incisors?\u2019 Or \u2018what is Unobtanium?\u2019 \nI would recommend this film on the grounds of: \nA: are you a fan of SCI- FI?\nB: Are you high?\nThis film deserves the credit it tried to bring itself, it knew what it was. Where do you turn left at England? ITS WALES!! WALES!!",

    "text": "Truly woeful movie. The cast is wasted on this piece of rubbish. It is almost a cartoon. An interesting premise, but ruined by the worst Hollywood 'science' imaginable. Radio communication to the surface from the bottom of the Marianas trench and then from several thousand feet below that into the centre of the Earth? Which supposedly has a molten metal core that can be forced to start spinning again by detonating nuclear bombs? I didn't pay anything to see it, but I want my money back anyway.",

    "text": "The Core might not win any awards for scientific accuracy, and sure, the premise alone invites every kind of eye-roll, but what it does deliver is something we\u2019ve been losing fast in today\u2019s cinematic landscape: original storytelling that doesn't try to go viral or squeeze itself into a franchise mold. It\u2019s from that 2000 to 2010 cultural crossroads, before everything became about metrics and trend-chasing. This was when movies still dared to be weird, flawed, ambitious, and most importantly, human. It has all the hallmarks of that era where studios were still funding original scripts, even if they were risky. And yeah, it paid the price at the box office, but I\u2019d argue it aged better than a lot of so-called \u201chits\u201d from its time.\n\nDirecting-wise, Jon Amiel keeps things grounded even when the plot is anything but. He never tries to oversell the drama or throw in unnecessary flash. Instead, he lets the characters carry it. And that\u2019s where The Core shines. The script is quietly brilliant. It doesn\u2019t scream its cleverness, it just talks like people talk. You\u2019ve got emotionally loaded one-liners, smooth transitions, and character-defining dialogue that lands in seconds and moves on. There\u2019s no pandering, no exposition dumps. You either keep up, or you miss it. That kind of confidence in the audience is rare now, especially when studios are so obsessed with clarity over character.\n\nOne thing that stands out even more today is how unfairly movies like The Core have been treated just because their science wasn\u2019t explained in a way that \u201cfelt\u201d believable. The truth is, there are tons of movies with equally ridiculous science that were accepted just because the script guided the audience more carefully. If a movie gives you a decent explanation, even a weak one, it becomes forgivable. But when it doesn\u2019t handhold, even if the logic is the same, it gets slammed. And that\u2019s a problem. The Core didn\u2019t flop because it was more far-fetched than others. It flopped because it didn\u2019t explain its madness in a way that made audiences feel safe. But honestly, once you get past that, what you find underneath is a character-driven, surprisingly well-written story with actual heart.\n\nWatching this in 2025 hits different. You realize just how rare it is now to get a non-franchise, non-remake, non-based-on-existing-IP kind of film. Out of the top 66 movies to earn over $100 million in recent years, around 70% were franchise flicks. That tells you everything. Studios are scared to invest in originality, so they don\u2019t. And we as an audience? We\u2019ve gotten used to that. But The Core, for all its plot holes, reminds you what it's like when a movie just wants to tell a story, not trend. It's a reminder that when you kill risk, you kill magic. So if you want to rewatch something that speaks to the lost art of character-driven, original cinema, give this one another look. You might be surprised at how much it says when it\u2019s not trying to go viral.",

Every so often, I need to rewatch and enjoy this one. I didn't understand when Roger Ebert was thumbs down on what I consider a worthy 134minutes of great entertainment. This film is no throwaway.",

I thoroughly enjoyed it and may have learned a thing or two.  For example, pre-movie I was not aware that the rotation of the liquid iron core of our planet provides the geomagnetic flux referred to and essential to our protection from cosmic radiation.",
