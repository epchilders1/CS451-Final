The two actors are gorgeous and great performers, the story is great and keeps you engaged, and it is nice to see the countryside of another country. The relationship of the main character, the girl, with her dad is strong and healthy (no crooked issues) and it is nice to see an all American romance between the US and Australia.",

I made an account and am writing my first movie review because I am dumbfounded that anyone would would actually believe Justice\u2019s act and the guy was the typical \u2018shut up and take your shirt off\u2019 stand in. \n\n2010\u2019s \u2018Stomp Clap and Hey,\u2019 \u2018Two guys with a crazy idea and a $30 burger joint\u2019 days are over and we\u2019re all collectively getting over the cringe.\n\nOn a lighter note I\u2019m sure Justice could probably be a better fit as a villain and Adam just needs to be some war movie extra handing a general his notes.",

    "text": "Ridiculous script by artistic city dwellers on a low budget, that have no idea of practical country life.   There is no sheep \u201cstation\u201d in Australia (Qld) with a wine growing enterprise and this sort of scenery that would  be 200 kms from the nearest neighbour \u2026 more like 5 kms.  Appears to be filmed in the Logan River Valley / \u201cScenic Rim\u201d area of SE Qld, just inland of the Gold Coast \u2026  a semi-tourist area.  An experienced station hand (farm worker) that persists up a hill in a Toyota ute that is obviously overheating \u2026 until it fails, would have been instantly dismissed from any farm.  Next day as a farm hand with full make-up and jewellery ?  Token temporary sheep yards set up on a mowed lawn ?  Wooden roofed enclosure for a pet sheep with a name sign ?\nThen It morphed from a rom com to slapstick comedy with cringey silly sheep jokes about 25 mins in.  Brown Snake \u2026. a  harmless python.\nMuch other cringe worthy moments - a film editors nightmare.  The script was the worst component.  Lead actress given corny dull lines - contrived, contributing to little chemistry between the lead actors.  Perhaps a problem of mediocre direction, camera work and background music.  Corny clich\u00e9 ending.  Barely a morning TV movie.",

    "text": "\"A Perfect Pairing\" is a film featuring Victoria Justice and Adam Demos that feels like Netflix's own take on the classic Hallmark formula. The streaming service has been trying to cater to fans of romantic comedies, but their efforts have waned recently, with less frequent releases and price hikes without delivering new content.\n\nFor me, this film lands in an awkward middle ground. It offers the charm of a romantic comedy, showcasing Victoria Justice's comedic timing and the creativity of the director. However, it falls short of originality, coming off as a formulaic copy of Hallmark's style without introducing anything fresh or engaging.\n\nI don't dislike the film; it was enjoyable enough to keep my attention and reveal some redeeming qualities. Yet, I find it puzzling that when crafting a screenplay, writers don't seek feedback from others. If someone were to tell me that this director or writer had people review their script, I would be skeptical. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have caught glaring issues along the way. It seems like they might be surrounded by people who are too timid to provide honest critiques, allowing significant mistakes to slip through.\n\nVictoria Justice does deliver a solid performance, showcasing her talent. However, since transitioning into adult roles, her acting credits have diminished, perhaps because she often leans toward more cartoonish characters instead of taking on more serious roles. Ultimately, while the film is passable, I wouldn't consider it worthy of a rewatch. I struggled to remember much about it until I revisited it, and I can't see myself doing so again.",

    "text": "Almost turned it off after about 20 minutes, as it was too full of bad slapstick and \u2018oh my god' from Justice. Just not really lifelike, over the top and therefore not funny: for example, no slightly normal person who trips and falls on the handle of a manure tank would then stand blabbering while people get sprayed. First thing you do is pull the handle back ! \nBut the beginning had promise and further on Justice becomes a more normal and loveable person. Also, good interaction with the other characters, nice plot development, nice scenery, predictable but very watchable.",

Her last name was different in this movie, but she was married. Hear me out, Zoey 101's Lola Martinez went on to make a wine business and this was the result.",

    "text": "Out of the multitudes of rom-coms put out each year by Hallmark, Netflix, etc. there are a few that stand out as a cut above and some that are so badly executed that you can't make it all the way through.  A Perfect Pairing is a cut above. To be sure the Australian scenery and on site filming locations draw you in as extra special but it is the story coupled with the chemistry of the leads that make this offering rise to the top. To be sure it's formulaic but it executes the formula with charm and natural ease that draws you into the story and rooting for the characters. It's not perfect (the conflict coming between the leads is the weak point) but it's one I wouldn't mind seeing again or having a sequel. To me that's the mark of a good rom-com: do I want to spend more time in that world with those characters? A Perfect Pairing is enjoyable and I suspect most people who like rom coms will like this one quite s bit.",

    "text": "Netflix version of a \"Hallmark\" movie, \"A Perfect Pairing\" is as generic as its title.  At least everything is beautiful.  Victoria Justice is the unbelievably attractive and spunky lead, and Adam Demos the hunky Australian whose most important trait is to be charming and to look good with his shirt off.  Of course the down under setting is luscious.  But, the plot is just like everything you might expect.  I swear I've seen this movie a five dozen times.  It even has the trendy lesbian couple who are nothing more than an afterthought.  The film checks off a lot of boxes. Too bad none of those boxes are for originality.",
