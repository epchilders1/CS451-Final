    "text": "Corny? Predictable? Maybe but I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. On to the review.\n\n\"Gunpowder Milkshake\" is a visual treat, boasting a stellar cast and a vibrant, action-packed storyline. Karen Gillan absolutely steals the show, delivering a performance that is engaging and entertaining. The film's vibrant tone and slick direction make it one of the most entertaining action flicks of 2021, hands down.\n\nHowever, despite the array of talented actresses, it feels like most of them are waiting in the wings until the final act to truly shine. This slow buildup does detract a bit from the overall impact, but when they finally get their moment, it\u2019s explosive and worth the wait.\n\nThe movie masterfully blends style and substance, offering a fresh take on the female assassin genre with nods to classics like \"L\u00e9on\" and \"La Femme Nikita.\" The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with a delightful mix of blood, guts, and elegant twirling that keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nWhile the narrative may not be the most compelling, and it's quite by the books and predictable, the film compensates with its eye-catching visuals and dynamic performances. It's a bit like a rollercoaster ride\u2014perhaps not the deepest experience, but undeniably thrilling and a whole lot of fun.\n\nIn short, \"Gunpowder Milkshake\" is a dazzling, fun-filled ride that action fans, especially those who enjoy female-driven stories, will undoubtedly appreciate. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a bold, entertaining romp that promises and delivers a good time.",

If you only have this movie as an option, turn off your system and sit in silence.  This is a perfect example of what happens when there is too much money thrown into a movie for actors, and the story is just pieced together from other movies and the director is just stealing from other successful directors for a style that they hope will sell.  It\u2019s a big puff of a movie with no semblance of a plot or direction.  I guess it\u2019s only redeeming quality is people were paid in the process of making the movie.",

    "text": "Gunpowder Milkshake is a lotta fun reminiscent of Atomic Blonde, but partially a little stylised like Sin City and maybe a little Leone thrown in too. Karen Gillan is great as the older Sam left by a mother on the lam for working a little too hard for her killer firm. Left behind Sam is cared for by her mom\u2019s handler Nathan (Giamatti) and he turns her into a more deadly employee than her mom. Alas, she kills the wrong guy before trying to get back money stolen by a firm accountant who\u2019s daughter\u2019s been kidnapped and feeling a kinship for this absent parented girl she messes up badly. All hell breaks loose when wrong guy\u2019s daddy goes after the girl & Sam & she enlists the aid of her absent mom (Headey) & her mom\u2019s friends (Bassett, Gugino & Yeoh). It\u2019s a freakin blood soaked free for all and just a lot of fun. Coleman is great as the little girl! \nPut it this way, if it made enough to order a sequel, I\u2019d buy another milkshake.",

Sam is raised and protected by Scarlet's handler Nathan, who is the Human Resources head of the assassin organization 'The Firm\"\n    Now it is 15 years later and Sam has become Nathan's top assassin. Sam's new hit is a man who stole money from The Firm. Easy job, kill him and bring back the money. Not! The thief's young daughter (Emily) has been kidnapped and Sam takes it upon herself to rescue and protect her.    \n   But The Firm is not happy and sends more assassins to kill Sam and Emily. \n     \"You think you have a chance here? I have an army.\" - Virgil\n    Now their only hope to survive is the three Lady Librarians.\n     This is a very polished, high stylish, fast-paced action, thriller that looks and feels like a Pulp Fiction magazine come to life.... With just a touch of Anime neons and violence. \n      The story is fueled with Girl-powered super cool assassins with super cool guns. The awesome cast really makes the story work. How can you go wrong with Michelle Yeoh, Lena Headley, Angela Bassett, and Carla Gugino. Just a pure entertaining popcorn flick.\n   Cast - Lena Headley, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, Carla Gugino, Karen Gillan, Paul Giamatti",

    "text": "The plot is not as original as the sharp and shiny snazzy neon style and settings suggest, so that doesn\u2019t help it any.  We\u2019ve already seen role reversal casts, so nothing there either.  Then they introduce the kid and, as per the Netflix usual, there seems to be an overabundance of relationship drama and dialogue. This is not 2004 where a film like this might become a trendsetter, now in 2024 it barely reaches the bar for what constitutes a typical and average film in 2024.  The conclusion partly delivers on the low expectations setup, but it was far too contrived.  Kill Bill 3 it is not.",

    "text": "Acci\u00f3n impecable en una historia que nos hace reflexionar sobre las decisiones impulsivas que hemos tomamos y que ahora nos afectan en nuestro presente. GunPowder Milkshake es genial. Tiene todos los componentes para ser una gran pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n, una trama simple centrada en la venganza, un dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n impecable y con suma personalidad, extras que se entregan en cada toma y que le dan un dinamismo brutal en cada una de las cientos de escenas de acci\u00f3n en montajes fenomenales. Una trama que expone de forma interesante el concepto de la venganza, vi\u00e9ndola m\u00e1s c\u00f3mo un obst\u00e1culo en cuanto a resentimiento y resoluci\u00f3n en vez de como una soluci\u00f3n al conflicto, (el factor de cientos de pel\u00edculas de acci\u00f3n), el darle ese giro al concepto de la venganza que hemos visto que se ha estandarizado en Hollywood c\u00f3mo una norma en \u00e9l g\u00e9nero, para mi es lo que le da su propia identidad. Una pel\u00edcula que a pesar de volcar todo su foco en un desenfreno de acci\u00f3n se da el tiempo de ser introspectiva con sus personajes, aunque sea de forma superficial, la pel\u00edcula se encarga de dotar de tridimensionalidad las acciones tanto de las protagonistas c\u00f3mo de los antagonistas de la cinta, en la que hacen una sutil cr\u00edtica rome sistemas \u201cpatriarcal\u201d con \u201cLa Firma\u201d, este poderoso grupo de hombres que desde un punto de superioridad minimizan las acciones que la protagonista ha hecho para ellos. Una Pel\u00edcula que gracias a lo poderoso tanto de su discurso c\u00f3mo de sus golpes logr\u00f3 diferenciarse en un g\u00e9nero que muchas veces discriminamos c\u00f3mo reiterativo y simplista. Una historia s\u00faper entretenida de ver.",
