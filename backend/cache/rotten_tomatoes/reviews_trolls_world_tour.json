This audience is being introduced to all sorts.\n\nIt even stopped discrimination & dictatorship with a talk about that a leader should be listening to what their people want & not have your own interests which are not everybody's dominate the world. When everybody has different things & are different, which is how we live in harmony & make the world go round. This lesson was learnt by Barb & Poppy.\n\nOnce again, the franchise is about courage & discovering.\n\nWhen you thought the story of the Bergens was over, wait until you see the mid credits scene.",

    "text": "'Trolls World Tour' is mostly what I expected the original film to be: an uninteresting story meshed with meh music. I, in fact, enjoyed the first flick, though this one I didn't. The all-troll story is a drop-off, who knew the Bergens were the glue that held this together?\n\nIt is practically a standalone sequel, the writers plucked this story right out of their, er, minds. That's not to say the plot is bad, it isn't, but it just didn't really hold my attention, the downgraded humour and less catchy music contributes. Character-wise, they give too much time to some.\n\nJames Corden and Ron Funches are given more prominent roles compared to last time out, but I'm too sure why; neither stood out to me and they are just as dull in this one, to be honest. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake do, at least, still lead it and those two are solid.\n\nNone of the new cast members stood out in terms of who they portray, though of course their voices are well known. Sam Rockwell, Mary J. Blige, J Balvin and Ozzy Osbourne are some examples, though there are a fair number of familiar peeps scattered throughout.\n\nI found 1 to be good, 2 to be not good. All eyes on 3, 'Trolls Band Together'...",

Poppy was insufferable in this movie, it made me root for the supposed villain, whose motives I found dumb; actually the whole movie was stupid and served nothing. KPOP girls and college punk rock guy were cool. \nI might watch the new movie, see if they did any better.",
