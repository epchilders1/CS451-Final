    "text": "Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway is a fun and lively family movie that builds nicely on the first film. The animation looks great, the humor is cheeky and self-aware, and James Corden brings lots of energy to Peter. While the story is a bit predictable, it\u2019s still heartwarming and full of laughs. Perfect for kids and enjoyable enough for parents.",

    "text": "Very heart gripping film\nA Quiet Place Part Two was one of my most anticipated movies of this year, and for good reason. A Quiet Place was one of my favourite films of 2018. That movie is basically proof that John Krasinski can direct well. This movie just emphasizes that.\n\nPerformances- Emily Blunt is fascinating in this film. She is one of the best aspects of this entire movie. Millicent Simmons who plays Emily Blunt's daughter has also given off a really good performance. Cillian Murphy was also really good.\n\nTENSION- Like the first film, this one too knows how to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The tension is present in this movie, from start to end. John Krasinski knows what to do with the tension in his films, and he knows what conflicts portrayed in his movies are most effective, and he utilizes them to the maximum. That's what makes him such a good director.\n\nA WORTHY SEQUEL- This is a damn good sequel. One appreciable thing worth mentioning is that- it feels as though they pay more attention to the human characters in this movie. A bit more than the first one. Another reason why this is such a good sequel is- it doesn't just try to be bigger than the first one. As a matter of fact, it 'is' bigger than the first movie, but it doesn't put too much emphasiz on being bigger. It feels just about as real and simple as the first one. This movie also takes the first ten minutes or so- to tell us where these creatures come from. A lot of sequels don't necessarily give us that-origin story, but this one does. That's great.\n\nWe want more, John Krasinski- Yes! He has proven his talent as a director with two very intense, amazing horror films. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of his work. Not just in the 'Quiet Place' franchise, but in other stuff as well. The man clearly knows what he's doing- and he's good in it. So, yes. We want more, John Krasinski!\n\nSo, A Quiet Place Part Two is an amazing movie. It's fresh, intense and is a worthy sequel almost as good as the first one. Although the ending seemed a bit rushed up for me, I don't really have that many flaws with this movie. I highly recommend this film to you",
