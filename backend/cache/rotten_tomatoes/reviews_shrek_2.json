    "text": "It\u2019s quite literally the best Shrek movie of all time, and yes I do believe it\u2019s 100% better than the original. The movie is undoubtedly a wonderfully written and well executed masterpiece. The story is similar to the first one but with a twist and in my honest opinion, that twist makes the movie stand out above the original. The characters are charming and entertaining to watch as always. The classic raunchy humor never gets old and the jokes are extremely clever and witty. What can I say? 10/10. 5 stars easy.",

    "text": "Shrek 2 is the only Shrek sequel worth having made and worth watching. Adding new and hilarious characters, recontextualizing the message of the first film in a poignant, if not always well executed manner and, of course, having much more of Shrek and friends\u2019 edgy 2000\u2019s humor. \n\nWhile the first film is, of course, meant to be a comedy, it does have a worth-while message: you are beautiful and worth being loved as you are. This film retreads that same message and while it doesn\u2019t hit with the same resonance as the first, it still provides much needed heart. This story fleshes out our characters a bit more, mainly Fiona and her family dynamic leading to the introduction of some great characters like Puss in Boots and, my personal favorite: The Fairy God Mother. Her dynamic character is oddly believable in this weird film, fluctuating between menacing fairy and corporately charming with ease as she functions as the Amazon.com of wishes and magic. \nThe humor here consistently strong with corny jokes, sight gags and Mike Myers\u2019 Scottish accent \u2014depending on how much you enjoy it at this point. That said, the story doesn\u2019t go as far with its themes as it could. Splitting up Shrek and Fiona for much of the film weakens the emotional impact, and Prince Charming, despite some funny lines, doesn\u2019t bring much beyond being a bland obstacle.\n\nShrek and this sequel will always have a special place in my heart. While Shrek 2 doesn\u2019t hit the same highs as the first or have the same emotional resonance it is still sharply written with great new characters and some fantastic performances.",
