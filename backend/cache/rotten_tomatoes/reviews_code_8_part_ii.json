    "text": "El punto fuerte de esta segunda parte es tal vez lo que haga que mucha gente a la que le encanto la primera se sienta decepcionada: ac\u00e1 esta mas claro quienes son los buenos y los malos, cosa que en la anterior no pasaba, y es todo mas lineal; pero a su vez tiene mejor ritmo y es mucho mas pochoclera, se siente todo mas Hollywood, va mas a la accion y a los bifes. Buena secuela que cumple en general pero para ver sin tanta expectativa.",

    "text": "Code 8 Part II - 7/10. Got an opportunity to see a special screening of this film (which I didn\u2019t know at the time would be the actual world premiere). And also, ironically, I never saw the original, so I went into this film with no sense of knowing what kind of movie it would be. Part 2 revolves around the concept of X-Men like mutants who live amongst people in a not so distant future, and in this future, police brutality and corruption involves robotic dogs and unfair drone surveillance. Overall, for a Canadian film, this is some good work in making an original sci-fi thriller with a socio political story. The performances are okay, and the VFX is good, but I think the overall message through the sci-fi elements is what helps elevate the film to be better than your run of the mill dystopian thriller.",

    "text": "Code 8 Part 2 is a decent sequel that builds upon the intriguing concept and plot of the first film. The action is good, and the characters are well-developed. The dynamic between the two protagonists, Connor and Garrett, is one of the highlights of the film. Stephen and Robbie Amell, being cousins, have great chemistry, and they play off of each other well. \n\nSirena Gulamgaus as Pavani, a young, very powerful, and grieving girl, held her own sharing scenes with the Amells. Her character seems to not only serve as central to the plot but, also, a second chance for Connor. \n\nThe film also explores some interesting themes, such as abuse of power, community, class systems, prejudice and discrimination against people with abilities, and how those \u201cpowered\u201d individuals are not only treated as second class, but used and manipulated.  Overall, Code 8 Part 2 is a solid action sci fi movie with a lot to offer fans of the genre.",

    "text": "The Good - 1) The themes and political intrigue is engaging and interesting, even if the premise is a bit basic. 2) The actor who plays Puravina is really good and I wouldn't be surprised if this is just a stepping stone role for her. 3) I was not expecting the ending to go off the way it did. It hammered home the intended idea behind the movie and is not a simple \"Superpowered vs non-superpowered\" ending, but has more behind it which I appreciate. 4) There were a couple scenes, especially one in the beginning that were very suspenseful and I was left on the edge of my seat.\n\nThe Bad - 1) I was left a bit bored by it and it was very slow to start with barring the \"hide and seek\" sequence. 2) This movie felt like just more of the same compared to part 1 rather than doing anything more with it. 3) I wish this movie had ended on a sadder note. They're setting up a 3rd movie, I believe, but I wish it ended in a way that was bleaker to set things to come if that is the case. If not, then I do not understand some of the dropped information comes into play\n\nOverall - A serviceable streaming movie. It has some great ideas and honestly, this world is interesting but the movies writing seems to be missing the mark except for it's heavy tones on police violence which are done to good effect",
