    "text": "'Love Is in the Air' is one I found to be surprisingly decent. Listen, it's cheesy/clich\u00e9 and it's Hallmark-esque, but I actually minorly enjoyed watching it. The poster is a little misleading, it does feature a romance but I wouldn't say it's that type of romance; as in kissy/cuddly.\n\nIt's more a fish out of water sorta love story, where the leads gradually develop a bond; they don't even get romantic together until the very end. None of this is a spoiler by the way, you'd be able to tell within the first few scenes where the whole thing is heading - and that's OK, imo.\n\nThe main reason why I did like this is most certainly the cast. I wouldn't even say that they give major performances, but as a group I found them to be very likeable and I was happy to follow them onscreen. Delta Goodrem and Joshua Sasse have enough chemistry, to boot.\n\nRoy Billing and Steph Tisdell offer pleasant support, elsewhere. Another positive is where the story takes place - coastal Queensland, Australia. All locations look nice, that and the aviation angle of the plot made it feel fresher than it would've otherwise been - in, say, a big city.\n\nA pass in my books, for sure.",

Pity as the scenes of the queensland tropics was lovely to look at , but I'd rather watch drone footage of Queensland than try and watch one more minute of the total mills and boon train wreck ! Don't even bother to try and watch it unless you want brain damage !",

She's supposedly this cool airplane pilot, living in this natural beautiful place and she has caked on makeup with fake eyelashes. It pretty much ruined it for me from the beginning.",
