    "text": "A deep look into a bandit's life who lived in a time ahead of his actual era. Whole mission was to paint this notorious criminal in a different shade that's not seen by many. In any reality theft is severely damaging but looking at Scott's behavior, his approach and his giving back signs us towards a rebellious side of the character. He engaged in a chaotic, unbeatable battle with a behemoth that most people can't even look at, much less yell at. So this reunion of both sides to narrate explicitly how Hollywood's story went down is greatly entertaining. Excellent visuals and footage. Makes this documentary well worth the time.",

    "text": "How To Rob A Bank - 9/10. Finally, a Netflix doc that offers up a great retelling and explanation to the events that are covered in great (and entertaining detail). As a huge Oceans film fan, this was a fun and cool watch. I\u2019m fascinated with the idea of a bank robber. Why do these individuals do the things they do? Why do they want to rob? Is it for ego, or for another purpose? This is a fascinating documentary which chronicles a famous robber and how that robber terrorized the city of Seattle. The interviews are actually interesting, and the retelling and chronicling of this robber leaves you interested and intrigued with how the robber did what they did. The doc also offers up a very interesting portrait about the robber themselves. The robber has such an interesting back story, and you see why and how they ended up being so successful at what they did to get their money. This could\u2019ve easily been a movie, but I liked the way they crafted together this doc! Solid work!",

I've actuallly been in the tree house and it was much larger and more interesting than any documentary could show. You had to climb up a twenty foot rope ladder to get to the first floor! Overall the documentary was well done and worth seeing.",

    "text": "As with everything in life, we are only privy to approximately 20% of what we see in any given experience. Surely the remaining 80% has compelling untold facts that would make an amazing movie. How to Rob a Bank does not vary from any other experience in life. This documentary was outstandingly produced, the music is also amazing, but again, we are only getting about 20% of the facts here.\n\nThe lead FBI Special Agent on the case, Shawn Johnson, epitomizes the quality of agents the FBI used to have in its prime. His interviews and compassionate comments show regard for human life, including the bank robbers, unlike that of other members of the task force. The comment that stands out particularly is that Agent Johnson indicated that there was always another day to catch \"Hollywood\". The Seattle cop who was also interviewed for this show seemed like he preferred blood over justice. Isn't pride one of the seven deadly sins? Not a quality I would want in an officer.\n\nIf you really pay attention to how things played out, you would understand that the investigation took 4 years because of the skill of Hollywood and his accomplices. This does not in any way diminish the immense skill of the FBI agents or other individuals involved in this case, who were also handling all other bank robberies in Seattle (which they indicated was about 1 a day on average). If I remember correctly, it was said in the documentary that Agent Johnson actually accurately predicted (based on facts, evidence, and pure skill) where Hollywood was going to rob next. It seems that the Hollywood robberies would have continued indefinitely if not for his level of competence.\n\nMark Biggins and Steve Meyers, Hollywood's accomplices, appeared to have integrity, compassion and remorse for their actions. I disagree with other reviews stating that Scott (Hollywood) is being glorified. This documentary takes a deep dive into the psyche of Scott and what lead him down this dark path. Mark and Steve did their time, completed their debt to society, and specifically state that they are remorseful for the harm their actions caused to others. This doesn't seem like a group of people who are proud of the harm they caused (unlike the cop).\n\nThis story has so many layers and so much information that it would be impossible to condense 4 years of investigation, all of the facts and information to accurately and completely be represented in 90 minutes. Even so, the directors and producers were still able to create quite a detailed and immersive storyline. The reenactments fitting in seamlessly with the animation storyboards was such an interesting and seemingly effortless effect.\n\nI will definitely be recommending this to others. It was far more accurate than the FBI files or the Ann Rule book which I watched/read years ago. It was nice to clear up some details that seemed questionable in those.",
