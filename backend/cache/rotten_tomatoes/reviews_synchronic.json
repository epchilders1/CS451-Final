    "text": "A paramedic (Anthony Mackie) dying of cancer realizes a new designer drug is able to send him thru time.\n\nBefore their new career as MCU directors, Benson and Moorhead created several low budget but critically regarded sci-fi films.  I viewed one and was underwhelmed.  However, I think at that time I was less forgiving of low budget films.  After their MCU work and this, I want to go back and revisit that film as well as see the others.\n\nThe crisis Mackie's character experiences is layered into the time-travel conceit.   Sadly, the time-travel isn't as tight as the best such movies portray.  But the emotional weight given to Mackie makes this an emotionally grounded and thought-provoking work.\n\nWiki says this film is in the same world as Resolution, The Endless, and Spring.",

    "text": "An intriguing premise with excellent and compelling visuals which ultimately fails to deliver. Mackie does the best he can with what he\u2019s given and turns in a fairly good performance, but much of the writing is uneven and heavy-handed. The film can\u2019t manage to balance its two protagonists - in my opinion, they ought to have focused on Steve\u2019s story and relegated Dennis to a side character (which they basically do anyway apart from the fact that the main problem of the film has to do with Dennis\u2019s miscast daughter). The pacing flags desperately in the latter half of the film, losing all urgency from what ought to be a dire situation. The comic moments, again delivered well by Mackie, just don\u2019t land. Ultimately not worth the watch past the first 30 minutes.",

    "text": "Mackie and Dornan do their best with the material, but the story moves along with a repetitive lull with unlikable characters until the story starts off way past the midpoint of the film. The script needed a ton of reworking to get the story rolling much earlier and to write characters that you actually care about. The premise was interesting, and I can appreciate the low-budget aesthetic, but for goodness sake bring in a script doctor to turn it into a properly paced story that establishes the story early on before annoying us with cheaply done character building between two whiny unlikable guys.",

    "text": "Muy buena pel\u00edcula, una cinta que me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho y la considero infravalorada. No esperaba mucho de esta cinta, la vi porque la trama parec\u00eda interesante pero no sent\u00eda que me iba a gustar tanto. Desde el primer momento te engancha debido a su alocada trama, y buscas respuestas desde la primera escena ya que no estas entendiendo que es lo que pasa. La ambientaci\u00f3n de la ciudad me parece esplendida, todo muy oscuro y con un soundtrack genial que acompa\u00f1a mucho a generar esta sensaci\u00f3n extra\u00f1a. La trama la considero bastante original, y todo lo visto, que si bien es complejo, se explica de una gran manera. Sin embargo, siento que podr\u00edan haber aprovechado mas toda la historia contada al punto de quiz\u00e1s hacer una serie, ya que a mi parecer cierra de manera muy abrupta y se podr\u00edan haber contado algunas cosas mas. Por otro lado, las actuaciones son brillantes, principalmente las de Jamie Dornan, Anthony Mackie y Ally Ioannides. En conclusi\u00f3n, una muy buena pel\u00edcula de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, de las mejores de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os a mi parecer, y eso que no escuche a mucha gente hablar de esta cinta, siento que se la deber\u00eda valorar mas ya que cuenta una muy buena e interesante historia con una ambientaci\u00f3n brillante. Muy recomendada.",

    "text": "Mackie & Dornan deliver powerful performances but the audio is so strong in places that the dialogue is muffled and unclear. I had to turn on subtitles. The storyline is predictable and contrived. More character development was needed to feel empathy for major and minor roles. Dornan's character arc was too much of a leap in its creation and completely unfair to Dornan's brilliant acting ability. One of the first scenes he wants to sleep around whereas the end he's begging his wife to talk to him. Nothing much inbetween, leaving the audience indifferent to what happens to him. The only thing that saves this movie are Dornan and Mackie's incredible acting. Too bad the storyline couldn't support them.",
