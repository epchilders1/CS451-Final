Great story with all the relative elements required, lots of suspense, drama, dilemma, twists and action. Great cast all very convincing in character. Memorable",

It tries to capture that \u201cDie Hard\u201d kind of tension but never quite gets there. While there are a few solid moments, the film overall doesn\u2019t leave much of a lasting impression.",

Daisy Ridley\u2019s ex soldier turned window cleaner faces armed eco-terrorists holding her autistic brother hostage, yet the script sidelines her for much of the runtime, diluting the tension. Despite flashes of suspense and solid performances, weak dialogue, underused setting, and flat pacing leave this as a conventional, forgettable actioner....",

Combine that with a typical hostage story where the tough unsuspecting female saves the day and that just makes for all kinds of subpar acting and endless cliches in this less than memorable picture.",

    "text": "Cleaner is the latest action movie from Director Martin Campbell and acrtress Daisy Ridley which is a disappointment. The film starts off like it will be a pretty good movie, only to quickly fall into the dull cliche type of movie. The move asks the audience to really suspend a lot of realism and buy into their ludicrous plot. I\u2019m not sure why Daisy Ridley even signed up for this movie even though she has already shown she can be an action star. Clive Owen is rarely used in this film and one has to think was he originally supposed to be in more of it. The action is not thrilling and not believable at all. The only saving grace is Daisy Ridley still gives it her all even when those around her are not. Cleaner gets a low 2 star out of 5 rating from me.",
