    "text": "Watching Ford v Ferrari for the second time confirms how James Mangold created a film that resides at the intersection of technical prowess and human emotion\u2014now I understand what may have escaped me the first time: more than cars, the film speaks of ambition, sacrifice, pride, and vulnerability.\n\nMangold's direction is confident and vigorous, especially in the sequences that remind me why I went to the cinema: breathtaking races, cuts that capture the danger, the almost physical camera, swaying along with the car. He never gets lost in tricks; control exists, but he allows the scene to breathe, so that the sound of the engine, the screech of the tires, the torque, and the sweat of the drivers make the viewer feel\u2014and not just watch.\n\nThe visuals are one of the film's greatest glories. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography recreates the 60s with richness: natural light, densely shaded interiors, expansive racing exteriors with open skies, metallic paint gleaming in the sun. The editing, the production design, everything converges on a tradition that transports you to the track. And the sound: every vibration, every gear change has texture, weight, presence. They are conventions of racing films reinvented with style.\n\nPerhaps the film still suffers from narrative redundancy at times\u2014the conflicts with Ford's bureaucracy could be more subtle, the human side perhaps emerges less in already worn-out dichotomies. But today, upon rewatching it, I feel that everything is so important because it built the emotional highs and lows, making me vibrate, suffer, and vibrate again.\n\nIncredible film and Mangold's direction is spectacular, from this \"new era of cinema\" in which we live. I don't know the director, but I fell in love with the way he handles the camera, simply sensational. \n\nRating: 9/10",

An amazing homage to this story packaged in a fast paced, emotional rollercoaster where there is also car racing. \n\nSpectacular visuals with an audio track that will be reference material for a long time. The surround sound mix is amazing. \n\nOne of my favorite films.",
