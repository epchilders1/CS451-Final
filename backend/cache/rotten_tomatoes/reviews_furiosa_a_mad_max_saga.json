    "text": "Like Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa has become \u2013 visually and technically \u2013 one of the most dazzling films I've ever seen. Everything in this film captivates the viewer: from the actors and cinematography to the soundtrack and memorable performances. This post-apocalyptic world is chaotic, bizarre, and extremely dangerous, which provides a uniqueness that sets it apart from anything else presented in cinema. The action scenes are splendid, so much so that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The origin story of Furiosa, a character introduced in Mad Max: Fury Road and played by Charlize Theron, is very compelling and well-developed, making me think that George Miller considered every detail when he created the character years ago. I was pleasantly surprised by Chris Hemsworth's performance here: perhaps because Dementus is quite different \u2013 \u200b\u200bin personality and appearance \u2013 from Thor, the Marvel character that launched Hemsworth to stardom. I also enjoyed Tom Burke's character (throughout the film, I kept wondering where I knew this actor from, only to discover later, upon checking IMDb, that I had already seen him in the film The Wonder, with Florence Pugh). Anya Taylor-Joy needs no introduction, delivering a performance unlike her previous roles. And Alyla Browne, whom I first encountered watching Sting, is definitely a star in action, delivering one of the best performances in the film. Oh, and at the very end, we get a glimpse of Charlize Theron's Furiosa, which made me eager to rewatch the 2015 film. Without a doubt, one of the best films I've ever seen!",

What even are they doing and why is it so long we don\u2019t even see Furiosa as an adult til the halfway point and all you see is Chris Hemsworth acting Dumb and Furiosa in the background crying like why is this a thing?",

    "text": "You want it or not, a comparation with the old movie is automatic. The first thing that comes to mind is that it kinda drags the story. It lacks the flow of the previous.\n\nThe main villan is unconvincing and I found myself many times not understanging how to categorise him. Is evil without a clear motive, powerful without convincing greatness. You don't know if you want to love him or not.\n\nThe actions scenes are ok, but no moment where I would thing it's something epic worthy. At times almost too much of the same.\n\nMaybe the main problem was the script, neglected in the face of the many action scenes paired with fancy camera movement. The plot was ok, but it lacked a smarter way of putting it on the screen.",
