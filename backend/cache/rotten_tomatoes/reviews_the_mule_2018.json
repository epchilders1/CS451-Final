Think of how few characters were required for Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby. The storytelling suffered a bit in this move. it felt ruseg.",

He successfully bridges a bygone era with modern sensibilities, playing in a role that aligns perfectly with his age. The Mule is raw and edgy at times, but with a heartfelt mission to redirect us to what truly matters in life: family.",

I'm iffy on Clint Eastwood movies, I like the playful ones, but not the Westerns, nor Dirty Harry movies.  \n\nI enjoyed his acting, he's finally learned how to.   Really, he's always been more of a one note actor, his talent is Directing and giving audiences what they want.  \n\nBut he was vulnerable and funny here.   I think more interactions with Bradley Cooper would have been enjoyable.   Great supporting cast.  \n\nClint Eastwood isn't a Mule, he's a goat.",
