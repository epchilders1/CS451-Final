    "text": "This film is predictable. That is the main problem. But besides for that, it is a pretty good watch. The humor is spot-on, the characters are very good, and of course, the sentimentality. It is a very sentimental film, definitely. In fact, it has a very emotional 'Family of Me' opening, which is to me the most sentimental opening to any Dreamworks film, more than How to train your dragon, or others. Hammy is my favorite character, and Carell adds a lot of hyperactive flair to the squirrel, so he was one of the best parts of the film overall.\nYes, I think this is a bit underrated. While it may be predictable, this movie didn't deserve to be 'eh..it is okay, but not good'. No, I think it deserves more than that. A raccoon gets a home and stops being selfish? You can't hate that type of film.",

Ben Folds does the soundtrack and pours his heart out in the lyrics and music. The characters are all great and unique in their own way, and all of them have a purpose in the film, while comprising the family dynamic this movie is absolutely famous for. The whole movie is super fun, very aware of its ridiculousness, and just overall a cute film.",
