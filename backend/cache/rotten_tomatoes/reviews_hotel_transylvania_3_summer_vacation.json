    "text": "It's still on the harmless side and makes perfect sense but it's the worst of the trilogy by a mile. Animation isn't bad but there are a lot of dumb scenes here. the whole hidden tomb on the ship from Indiana Jones was so out of place and made me question what I'm watching. The D.J. battle at the end is so stupid also. It is still fluid and creative at times though. The music is alright and easily the worst of the three. While the others had problems with mixing of genres, this just has way too much variety and too many dance tracks that just don't fit. Voice acting is on the ok side of things. Sandler here isn't bad but just doesn't sound as crisp in the other ones. The new characters are alright. Everyone returning is just kind of there for gags rather than anyhing else. There not given much to work with. Editing and pacing aren't good. Once they get on the cruise ship, stuff just happens, too much happens, nonsense, and too many gags. It just gets muddled bouncing around between the romance, Mavis and her Dad, gags with the gang, pointless subplots, and other things. The humor is alright but easily the worst of the three. It just relies too much on humor here and feels like it gets too stupid at times and into too much slapstick. Skip this. Boy cruise ship movies just have a terrible record overall. Still better than social media influencer films though.",

    "text": "Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation\n\nThis movie was honestly super cute and a refreshing continuation of the Hotel Transylvania franchise. By the third installment, you might expect things to feel stale, but instead it\u2019s full of life, color, and heart. One of the sweetest elements is seeing Selena Gomez\u2019s character, Mavis, now a mother. That dynamic adds a whole new layer to the story, because not only do we see her relationship with her father, Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), but we also see how she balances being both a daughter and a mom. That family thread really grounds the comedy.\n\nAdam Sandler once again goes all in as Dracula, bringing the same wild and goofy energy that\u2019s been consistent since the first film. His exaggerated voice work and zany antics never get old, and in this film, his story is tied up in themes of loneliness and unexpected love, which makes him more relatable than ever. The fact that Dracula finds himself falling for Ericka, the cruise ship captain (who also happens to be connected to his greatest enemy, Van Helsing), creates the perfect blend of humor and heart. Their back-and-forth romance is surprisingly charming, with plenty of laughs along the way.\n\nWhat makes this entry stand out is the vacation setting itself. Moving away from the hotel was a smart choice, giving the characters a new environment full of wild possibilities. The cruise ship, the Bermuda Triangle, the underwater volcano scenes \u2014 all of it is so vibrant and creative. It gives the animators room to really play, and visually it\u2019s the most fun of the three films.\n\nComedy-wise, this is probably the funniest Hotel Transylvania movie yet. The family dynamics are more exaggerated, the slapstick gags land harder, and the use of modern music and dance battles (yes, there\u2019s a full-on EDM showdown with Van Helsing\u2019s monster-destroying device) feels ridiculous in the best way possible. Kids will laugh nonstop, but adults will also catch themselves chuckling at the clever timing and over-the-top chaos.\n\nAs for the series overall:\n\t\u2022\tThe first film was fresh and creative, setting up the world and characters.\n\t\u2022\tThe second film, in my opinion, got better, especially with the addition of Mavis and Johnny\u2019s son and the generational humor.\n\t\u2022\tBut the third film might just be my favorite. It feels like the most balanced \u2014 funny, sweet, colorful, and surprisingly heartfelt.\n\nNo, these characters aren\u2019t the kind that you think of when naming your all-time favorite animated icons, but they don\u2019t need to be. They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re lovable, and the world Genndy Tartakovsky has built is consistently creative.\n\nOverall, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is lighthearted, family-friendly fun with a lot of comical moments. It might not be groundbreaking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s pure entertainment, and I\u2019d definitely recommend it for both kids and adults looking for something silly, sweet, and joyful.",

This movie is so funny I love that Dracula fall's in love with the cruise ships captain Erica and finds out that she is the great granddaughter of his monster hunter enemy Abraham Van Helsing and that she was trying to kill him but also falls in love with him and that in the end Van Helsing has a change in heart This film earns 5 stars 100%",

    "text": "Had me giggling nearly all the way through bar the few sad parts - Classic and adorable characters and tropes but with bucket loads of laughter amongst predictable taglines. Behind this was a profound message on loss,  acceptance and love.  \nDownsides - lots of music (even if there are quite a few catchy classics), lots of stuff happening, hyper- sexualisation and a very simplistic view of 'love' and loss - in parts-  all though can be said for most movies (even family/kid movies)\n\nAlso, surprised how reflective it is today i.e. depicting our relationship with tech etc and I'm wondering if this started the attempt to paint 'eastern' peoples (and accents!) in a more positive light (well even if they are painted inherently bad)..think Despicable me vibes",

    "text": "A franchise that has the stereotypical threequel involving summer/vacations.\n\nIt could seem enjoyable/amusement for the family audience, but it feels less than something classic of its predecessors.\n\nDracula has started to turn into a bachelor in this when it came to the death of his wife, Martha & gets a lust for life with the ships captain.\n\nIt's very like a 2010s Ice Age movie; not the greatest & should be the one that is worth to end the franchise.",
