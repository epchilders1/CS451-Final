Then honestly you could watch the first 5 mins, then the last 15 mins and you get the whole story. Everything in between is pointless",

I love that Jeremy Renner is seen for more than his action movie roles, because again\u2026 WOW.\n\nAny story that highlights the strength of family, bond of grief, and the intelligence that comes with truly knowing your environment.\n\nIt is not flashy. It is not showy. It\u2019s gritty and raw. Real human emotions\n\nOverall: A top 20 movie I have ever watched. And you should too.",

    "text": "The setting in the cold and snow covered mountains is out of this world magnificent.   But it is also a cruel and unforgiving environment, amplifying the loneliness of its inhabitants.   In an area the size of Rhode Island, there are only 6 tribal police officers.  Not surprisingly, the misfits, the druggies, the perpetually drunk and other miscreants can hide in their isolated trailers and do whatever they want ---- or think they can.  But a moment of lust and alcohol-fueled conflict leads to murderous crimes.  It is the job of the main characters played excellently by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen to finally bring some measure of justice and peace.",
