Combine that with a ramping down of stakes from the previous films where the threat was ultimately 3 nukes, and I think we find ourselves at an impasse.  I still enjoyed the film, but I'm hoping the eighth film is the last.  This needs to end, everyone just looks tired.",

    "text": "Dead Reckoning takes the easy route for Ethan Hunt\u2019s final threat with an AI bent on destroying humanity using nuclear missiles\u2014a danger that the last James Bond had already offered us. While the film drags at times, with moments that could have easily been trimmed, it still delivers the kind of high-stakes sequences we love in Mission Impossible, such as the train and airport scenes. That said, one can\u2019t help but wonder why Ethan, who has access to face-mask technology that prevents him from being identified, would choose to walk into such a heavily monitored airport without using one. Still, the movie keeps us engaged, and in the end, it\u2019s a thoroughly entertaining ride.",

Fighting on top of a train?? Really?! May as well have done a sword fight up a staircase, or maybe running in and out of doors like Scooby Doo. And Tom Cruise is starting to look weird, David Hasselhoff weird.",

    "text": "I can honestly say this movie is one of the worst I've seen it quite some time. The thought that hundreds of people worked their tails off to produce this dreck is really disappointing \u2014 for THEM. The writers, producers (lookin' at you, Tom), and director all share the blame for this. It's almost unwatchable; it's that bad. The chase scene \u2014 is there more than one? I'm only half-way through this overlong, nearly 3-hour movie \u2014 is pretty good but we've come to expect at least THAT is decent. The acting, particularly on the part of Tom Cruise, is way too internal. If I can't see it on your face, Tom, I can't read your mind through the screen. What I cannot believe is that both critics (whom I usually ignore) and the audience (whom I usually trust) are sucked in by this terrible script, lousy acting (still lookin' at you, Tom), and substandard direction on this self-parodical, over-produced mess of a movie. Hard pass. I'm not sure if I'll even watch the next one if it's more of the same.",

Just don't expect your typical mission impossible, in terms of story that is.\n\nI love movies about AI and the potential dangers it brings to mankind, but i also aknowledge that incorporating that into this kind of movie will always be complicated and difficult. For that reason, the script here didn't do a great job.\n\nIt had some cool scenes, but it wasn't enough for me. \n\nI'm still giving it a positive review, but this is not the best mission impossible had to offer.",

While I\u2019m usually in for a far fetched romp this far fetched tale riding on the rise of AI is very hard to follow and understand. The Action is mediocre for the whole save the world genre. The dialog is the most unrealistic I\u2019ve heard out side of children\u2019s cartoons. If I hadn\u2019t had a house full of guests invited to watch I would have save 3 hrs of my life for something more productive.",
