    "text": "Siento que es algo m\u00e1gico cuando ves el documental de tu \u00eddolo musical, cada experiencia es \u00fanica y no ser\u00e1 compartida por todos, pero es algo seguro decir que todos sentir\u00e1n lo mismo cuando vean la historia de ese artista que de alguna forma te cambi\u00f3 la vida; y a m\u00ed me acaba de pasar con \u201cI\u2019m Tim\u201d, este documental est\u00e1 lejos de ser perfecto, el principal defecto que le encontr\u00e9 es que muchas veces se siente inconexo, en algunos videos te muestran la creaci\u00f3n de una canci\u00f3n desde el estudio, y en otros ya directo cuando es un hit; pocas veces vemos lo que ser\u00eda narrativamente correcto, la creaci\u00f3n de la canci\u00f3n para despu\u00e9s mostrar su impacto medi\u00e1tico. Y se entiende que este documental depende completamente de los pocos videos que Tim ten\u00eda en los estudios, c\u00f3mo de sus \u00faltimas entrevistas; pero no s\u00e9, siento que podr\u00edan haber indagado m\u00e1s en los artistas que estuvieron a su alrededor, c\u00f3mo Aloe o Chris; me pareci\u00f3 criminal que este documental no llegara ni a las 2 horas de duraci\u00f3n, o que no mostraran casi nada de \u201cThe Nights\u201d, \u201cWaiting For Love\u201d, en general se ignor\u00f3 mucho a \u201cStories\u201d o peor a\u00fan que no se mencionara a Tereza Kacerova. \n\nPero hay que enfocarnos en todo lo dem\u00e1s de este documental, no es exageraci\u00f3n que habr\u00e9 llorado m\u00e1s de tres veces viendo esto, las entrevistas con las celebridades invitadas son incre\u00edbles, c\u00f3mo de la forma en la que se expresan de Avicii, a pesar de ya saber el tr\u00e1gico destino que tendr\u00eda este documental, no deja de ser impactante, en especial Henrik Burman recalca mucho en toda la duraci\u00f3n, lo importante de ser escuchado tanto por otras personas c\u00f3mo por nosotros mismos, esta pel\u00edcula reitera una y otra vez c\u00f3mo sin importar que en nuestra superficie parezca que no tendr\u00edamos de que quejarnos, lo que realmente importa es siempre tener un prop\u00f3sito que nos haga felices, aunque sea dif\u00edcil, siempre encontrar el momento para disfrutar lo que en verdad nos llena, ya sea algo mundano u ostentoso, lo importante es darnos aunque sea un minuto para sentirnos en nuestra mal nombrada \"Zona de Confort\u201d. \n\nYo creo que, aunque las personas que apenas supieran quien es Avicii van a amar este documental, tiene momentos realmente m\u00e1gicos, la m\u00fasica es hermosa y la dota de un contexto que en una nueva revisitada ser\u00e1 a\u00fan mejor. Esta pel\u00edcula m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de hablar del mejor DJ de todos los tiempos habla de qui\u00e9n realmente era Tim, tanto de sus demonios c\u00f3mo de su personalidad que conquist\u00f3 a toda persona que se le cruz\u00f3.",

A real insight into Tim\u2019s creative mind, it makes listening to his music all the more impressive. Lovely to hear him speaking throughout but also heart wrenching hearing his struggles.

The film blends behind-the-scenes footage and genuine Avicii interviews, revealing his creative brilliance and also his mental struggles. It captures the highs of his groundbreaking career and the challenges of navigating the fame that came along with his success. A must-watch for fans and anyone inspired by resilience and creativity.",

This is a gift for everyone, not only for the music, but above the many road we can take unconsciously.\n It\u2019s not a film about EDM music, it\u2019s a film about life.",

Fan of Avicii or not, you\u2019ll marvel on how the doc explores the creative process of some of his biggest hits and take you on his journey through making it in the music industry, as well as the mental health battles Tim was fighting up until the moment he ended his life. RIP Tim, you\u2019ll always be missed.",

    "text": "What an outstanding, breathtaking documentary.  The producers did a fantastic job of keeping it moving while slowing down at key points to show the viewer what was happening mentally with Tim at the time.  I especially like how they lingered on the creative process while he was composing some of his most memorable worldwide hits. It is such an amazing view into the mind of a genius, and is supported by interviews with so many gifted artists he collaborated with. I got chills several times during the concert scenes, just watching the energy and happiness he brought to so many people. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",

You can laugh now, anyways give it all the awards right now, because that was the best piece of media I've seen in the last 5 years. And it shows his life which is what Tim always wanted as he said in this quote \"I want to be remembered for the life I lived not the money I made\" - Tim Bergling, Avicii he also uses it in lyrics for example The Nights \"One day you'll leave this world behind so live a life you will remember\" he expressed that he wanted to be remembered for who he was and for the life he lived and this documentry does a great job of showing that. RIP TIM WE MISS YOU, YOU WERE ONE OF A KIND!  Avicii forever \u25e2\u25e4",
