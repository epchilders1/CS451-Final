    "text": "Fairly muddled and lacks the focus tonal/character focus it needs to be as heartwarming or meaningful as it thinks it is. Admittedly, I was enjoying the first act a fair amount and then the film really descends into early 2000's Disney Channel type fodder. At least the actresses were nice to look at and I actually got a sense of the 'roadtrip' experience via the locations.",

    "text": "Well, since that movie had quickly caught my interest and since that this is the only movie that Britney Spears has ever starred in, I thought I should just go ahead and start this review without wasting any time. The trio, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi played by Britney Spears, Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning, bury a \"wish box\" and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation. But that honestly never happened until eight years later on their graduation night when they reunite to dig up the \"wish box\", remembering their old wishes: Kit wanted to get married, Lucy wanted to find her mother who abandoned her, and Mimi wanted to travel to California which they decide to go. So the trio including Ben go to California to have their wishes come true. I like Britney Spears, I listen to her songs when I was a little kid. I listened to songs \"...Baby One More Time\", \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", but I cannot get over at how outrageously hilarious the lyrics are in the other version. It was nice to see Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall in it. That was quite a surprise for me. Another thing is Zoe Saldana is in it too. Next time you'll get to her in Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy. But what's really surprising to me is that I actually enjoyed this movie. Yeah I gotta say, this is way better than the live action Bratz movie. Yes, I said that title many times when it comes to chick flicks. And another thing is that the film was panned by critics and audiences. Yeah, I know I heard that the critics hated it back in the day. It got many razzie noms including two others that won. Goddamn. But in later years, it gained a cult following by many people who liked it so that's one thing. If you like Britney Spears and many chick flicks in general, you'll might like this one. For what it is, it's quite a surprise. That got me fulfilled to the end.",

    "text": "I am completely aware of the fact that \"Crossroads\" was not made for my demographic. Keeping that in mind, I actually thought this movie was not that bad. I enjoyed moments of it and think it had a fun soundtrack and early 2000s vibe. I don't think the acting is that great and the story takes some insane turns in the last act, but there were times I did actually enjoy the road trip in this movie. Overall, it is a movie that isn't technically good, but I can see why it may be a guilty pleasure for some, especially as it really does serve as nostalgia for the era it was made in.",

I thought she was amazing and the whole film was a classic of it's genre. Not Oscar material, and none the worse for that. It made me laugh and cry - what more can you want!",
