Eg for old mines, old estates, caves etc. The perp would have to have access via road to some point near his lair. But no put their best witness in front of the press so the perp knows she's alive and well and come get her. Then take the victim out to the woods with only two other people. Sorry just lost it after that.",

Morgan Freeman was great too, his calm, confident presence fits perfectly in roles like this, and he definitely carried a lot of the movie\u2019s weight.\n\nOn the other hand, William Converse-Roberts, who played Dr. Wick Sachs wasn\u2019t very convincing. For a character tied to such a disturbing element of the story, his performance lacked the intensity or depth needed to make it truly impactful. It felt like a missed opportunity to add more tension to the scene.\n\nThat said, the movie overall was cool. It had a solid pace, good production values, and kept me engaged throughout. While it\u2019s not one of those thrillers that blows you away, it\u2019s worth a watch",
