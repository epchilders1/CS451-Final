    "text": "An interesting period film based on real events. I felt it was okay. Some beautiful shots, good fight scenes, and well enough acting, though nothing really stood out. I feel like it wanted to be more than what it was. Plus our hero Jan is supposed to be considered one of the greatest military leaders ever. I'm not sure if that was expressed well in this movie. My main issue lied with the flow of the story. It wasn't bad, but it not great.",

    "text": "Medieval had the potential to be a gritty and intense war epic, but it feels like a film that was hacked apart in post-production and left to rot. What could have been a gripping and immersive historical drama is completely undermined by shoddy editing, abysmal dubbing, baffling casting choices and some of the worst American accents ever heard in a medieval setting.\n\nThe most immersion-breaking issue is the post-production dubbing, which is genuinely awful. Michael Caine, one of the film\u2019s biggest names, sounds like he\u2019s been replaced with a random voice actor in post. His dialogue is completely detached from his performance, making every scene he\u2019s in feel bizarre and unnatural. But it\u2019s not just him. Several other characters have an odd, out-of-sync quality to their lines, making conversations feel disjointed and lifeless. It\u2019s impossible to tell if the original performances were bad or if the atrocious ADR just sucked the soul out of them, but either way, the result is a disaster.\n\nThe film\u2019s biggest crime, though, is its casting. While Ben Foster does a solid job as Jan \u017di\u017eka, the rest of the cast is all over the place. Some actors look lost, others overact like they\u2019re in a pantomime, and then there\u2019s William Liz\u00e1r, who delivers what might be one of the worst performances I\u2019ve seen in years. To make matters worse, a handful of actors speak with thick modern American accents that completely rip the audience out of the medieval setting. There is nothing more ridiculous than watching a gritty historical war film where half the cast sounds like they\u2019re about to order a burger and fries. The fact that no effort was made to adjust their speech for historical authenticity just reeks of laziness and lack of attention to detail.\n\nEven if you can overlook the atrocious post-production work, the pacing of the film is a mess. Scenes drag on with clunky dialogue that adds nothing, and then suddenly, the story lurches forward with no cohesion. There\u2019s very little emotional weight to anything, which makes it hard to care about the characters or the stakes. The plot, which should have been a thrilling political and military drama, feels hastily thrown together, like a series of disjointed set-pieces rather than a fully realised story.\n\nThe only redeeming quality here is the action. When the film shuts up and lets the combat take centre stage, there are glimpses of something better. The fight scenes are gritty, brutal and well-shot, with a sense of weight and impact that few medieval films manage to capture properly. Unfortunately, these moments are too few and far between, buried under layers of poor direction and an editing job that feels like it was done with a blunt axe.\n\nIn the end, Medieval is a frustrating experience. There was potential for a gripping war epic, but it\u2019s been completely ruined by post-production incompetence, wooden performances and a fundamental lack of historical immersion. If you\u2019re looking for brutal medieval combat, there are flashes of quality here, but it\u2019s not enough to save the film from being a clumsy, poorly put-together mess. It feels like something that was rushed, chopped apart and left to bleed out on the editing room floor. A massive disappointment.",

    "text": "A solid film, with a strong cast. It plays a little too traditional and safe, and a few type casts, and it has not-much-needed romantic sub plot.  But it chronicles some of Jan \u017di\u017eka early battles and displays some of his tactical brilliance and innovations, albeit condensed. And the visuals are great, the action strong and it features an absolutely stunning soundtrack.",

    "text": "First thought: How the hell did they get Michael Caine for this movie? Well, he\u2019s not in it very much. A brutal riverside-cliff melee sets the tone for the graphic violence in Medieval, a story about Czech folk-hero, Jan \u017di\u017eka (Ben Foster). \u201cLove Triangle\u201d isn\u2019t the right term, but Katherine (Sophie Lowe) is captured, re-captured, re-re-captured ad infinitum (or so it seems) that it becomes tedious to follow. She\u2019s the betrothed of some guy named Rosenberg (Til Schweiger) who doesn\u2019t even have a title in this title-laden era, so why the F should we even care? I\u2019m here for most Medieval European settings, and when it comes to the ultraviolence that pervades the era, the movie doesn\u2019t disappoint \u2014 despite the maces to the face and stakes finding their way through a lightly armored soldier, the nastiest moment comes when maggots are used as first-responder medical care. It\u2019s a fine pocket of history movie with numerous skirmishes and a couple of larger battles. The dialogue is textbook and dull. It\u2019s recommended for a very particular audience but not for any sort of mass appeal, unlike, I will argue The Last Duel.",

Brutal, visceral, unrelenting, it's definitely not for kids or the feint of heart, so disclaimers here, but Ben Foster shines as a historical military genius that's very understated, I had never heard of Cizka before I saw this movie.",

    "text": "Disappointing period piece that does little to explore the fabled Jan Zizka, who truly deserves a proper movie.  The cast is solid, with the always welcome Ben Foster playing Zizka nicely as a conflicted religious man with a brilliant military mind.  Behind the camera, writer/director Petr Jakl tries to tell the story of Jan Zizka through his little known early life but doesn't quite get there.  The action is nicely choreographed and brutal along with showing off Zizka's innovative military tactics, such as using armored carts like tanks.  However, the story is thin and confusing, doing little to set up the history and Zizka's life.  All in all, a disappointment in what should have been an epic movie.",

Ben Foster was great in the lead role (and his career trajectory has impressed me, I remember him from Six Feet Under). Michael Caine has a small but important role, and his presence gives the film some cachet. Anyway, immensely entertaining film; I was immersed from start to finish.",
