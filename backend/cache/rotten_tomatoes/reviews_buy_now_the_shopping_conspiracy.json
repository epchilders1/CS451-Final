I was so interested but this was unbearable to watch. Was this produced by high school kids? Honestly it was so bizarre.",

    "text": "The documentary is primarily characterized by annoying animation, peculiar voiceovers, and unconventional/weird editing, seemingly aimed at being \"cool.\" This approach detracts from its potential to educate viewers on overconsumption and its impact on daily life. Unfortunately, it fails to provide any new or meaningful insights. I learned absolutely nothing watching this documentry. Don't waste your time!",

She built up all the way to this \"surprise\", only to reveal there was none in the end. That she lied and regrets nothing. I think it really hammered in the theme that \"Hey, these corporations are scumbags!\", and wow, was I impressed. It's... It's incredible. And even more so that it's a freaking robot. Because we tend to forget that... at the end of it all, corporations are not people.",

    "text": "Enjoyed the film, there were some interesting stories from people up to CEO level in FMCG companies, and people in waste management, but it could have been so more. Some shocking figures, eg 190,000 garments manufactured every minute, but it didn't delve any deeper. Mentioned microplastics, for about 30 seconds; the recycling farce but didn't elaborate much; \"donated\" waste sent to Africa but just showed a polluted beach. There was little shock value, very underpowered, no real warning of where this will lead us, and the film was packed with AI graphics, seemingly like it was intended for instagram - which may have been deliberate as that may be the target.  In the end it was interesting but with no clear threatened outcome, it was overall too watered down to be alarming - or to make a difference.",

It clearly\nshows how the people behind the movie are neat in their fight against the\n\"system\" (I know, bloated word but yeah, let's call it that way).\nIt makes sure to grab your attention, in the way you're used to,\nwhen you scroll and you see a \"Buy Now\" button and bunch of bright\ncolors. Not by keep you looking at just a sad, insanely rich footage of\ndumpsters accumulating waste every second. No, they make it so nice and tidy,\nyet somewhat twisted, even picturing and visualizing the data about how many\nsmartphones are produced every day, by making it pop out of the streets in\ncomputer graphic. So yeah, it's cool, you're watching. And then they\nsay something insane like \"yes, I worked ad Amazon for years, I know what\nI'm saying and they fired me. this is where we are\". And there you're not\njust watching. You're listening. And you see the truth. Naked. You see\nall the things you've been ignoring without even knowing, and you're\nnot just called to action, you're really called to think deeply about\nwhat you care about and why. Because that's what you're doing, no\nmatter how anesthetized you are. And if by any chance you feel like\nyou're now, while watching the documentary, out there opening the\nTruman Show's door, keep that door open, you're waking up, don't fall back asleep.\nAnd don't be scared. You can stay by the door if you don't feel like\ndiving through it. It's ok. Just keep it open because\nit's there, and you should watch it for what it is, realize the world\nyou're into and fix things up while you're awake.",

They needed to take all of the time spent on weird graphics/music/knock-off Alexa narrating, and put it into coming up with some intelegent questions to ask a panel of people who had the potential to be very very intresting.",

To be honest it kind of feels made by AI?\n\nThe so called experts they had on have no real solutions and honestly just come across as disgruntled former workers.  Of course they are so righteous and did nothing wrong.. yeah hard to believe.\n\nAgain the message is good but it needs more substance and someone to actually put it together coherently.\n\nAlso fear mongering imagery of cities buried in mountains of garbage.. obvious that they are trying the same manipulation tactics they are supposedly against.",
