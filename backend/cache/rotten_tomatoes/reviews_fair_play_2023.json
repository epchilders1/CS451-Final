The jealousy, gaslighting, spineless whinny white man entitlement because a more intelligent, and deserving woman got the job he thought should be his.  I loved this movie and Phoebe Dynevor and Alden smashed it out the park. Netflix paid a lot for this movie only to let it down. Had all the potential to been an award contender.",

    "text": "Fair Play on Netflix starts off as a seemingly passionate romance between Emily and Luke but quickly descends into a disturbing and unsettling portrayal of power and ambition\u2019s corrosive effects on their relationship. I have to give it a high score for the acting\u2014the performances were strong\u2014but the content, although I guess possible, was not right for me. The graphic swearing and explicit, often uncomfortable, sexual scenes made it a tough watch. The ending left me feeling disturbed, and overall I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you\u2019re prepared for a grim, intense experience.",

Although the ending seems like a conclusion to their destructive insanity, it's doubtful it is.   They are trapped in a never ending cycle of their sick pathologies, insecurities, self loathing, and unhealthy co-dependency.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.",

It's not fun, it's awkward, you want to hide behind the sofa but it's brilliant. Most of this film is high tension but its last quarter is positively disturbing as the main characters disintegrate whilst all characters show their worst side but in a way that nobody can predict.",

I really loved how you could tangibly feel and empathize with what both sides of this war were feeling, rather than being a one sided perspective. Falls shy of 3.5 stars because the ending cheapened it for me.",

    "text": "It wasn't a thriller.  It was 2 people putting money ahead of everything else in their life. You start off sympathizing with them hoping they survive as a couple but then the stupid things each one thinks, then actually says, just shows neither is grown enough to have a partner. SPOILERS:\nHer first mistake was offering her bf HELP to get promoted. How could he have any autonomy or esteem as an individual after that, professionally or as a husband? I'm a wife & would only help my husband professionally without him knowing, if he needed it. But I would always give him all the credit to everyone, him included, but because he does things all the time to help me in ways that no one needs to know about. Don't destroy someone's respectability. \nOne of his MANY mistakes was allowing his professional goals & obsession with the boss to come before himself, & his future wife, literally pledging himself on his knees, calling the boss \"his god\"... cringe! After that, I could not marry him or have him working for me. Because he has no self respect, at all. Only God deserves worship. He only gets cruel & stupider after that",

He doesn't make her laugh and he never makes a smart impressive move. In none of their conversations do they ever reminisce about the past or anything that would indicate a reason for a connection. You end up cheering for the lady to leave him but she takes too long and because of the lack of connection or challenge from him it's unclear why she sticks around for so long.\n\nDespite this major flaw, the movie's mood and flow is entertaining and only because of this do I give it 3 stars.",
