If anything I loved the 2nd more due to the amount of epic intense and engaging fight scenes that 2nd one has! It adds perfect drama to set up for the 3rd (hopeful) movie. I think the plot was well done- despite other people\u2019s criticisms- because it perfectly added Qwyn which was a great character to add and introduced another key villain to beat later on. Each event was also perfectly designed like the nuclear reactor being a trap to lure and capture the immortals. Quite honestly I never write any reviews but it kills to see negativity despite an outstanding first and second film! Great actors, great plot- and an understandable, sequential build and 2 great films so far! Credit to the hard work put in and I really hope that it gets the 3rd movie it deserves! We all need an ending!",

I've seen soooo many crap movies the last few years (that have gotten way better reviews) so this isn't fair. I liked this one a lot. I loved the first one more but still enjoyed myself. Charlize is more relatable in the one. I'm thinking the story line will be explained in the third one because there were holes but the reviews definitely don't give it the credit it deserves.",
