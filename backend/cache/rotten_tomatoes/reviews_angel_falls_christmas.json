Honestly Gabe, the angel won my vote to win the girl. Should have been written with a different plot and outcome. Actors can overcome a weak script, but these actors did not overcome. I think if the fianc\u00e9 had been cast with an appealing guy, the movie could have been redeemed.",

I would imagine that an angel would be a little out of place in our world, so I thought the direction he took on the part was spot on.  I saw the same lead actors in another film recently and so the acting in this film was more noticeable.",
