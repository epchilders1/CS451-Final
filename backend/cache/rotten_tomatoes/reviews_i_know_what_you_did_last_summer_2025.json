    "text": "Danicas face pissed me off the whole time, the lip pout is definitely unfavorable, its like a child trying to get their way. The fact she did not die had me somewhat in a spiral considering the fact that the killer didnt have any problem killing innocents who werent even involved. She also cuddled up with her friend after her husband just died. The fact ray\u2019s character was ruined at the end after he was portrayed to be someone who cares about people\u2019s emotions was also crazy. Netflix having this locked as if it\u2019s anything to upgrade your subscription about is insane too. Poor quality and low thought went into this movie I feel.",

    "text": "DER WASSERMANN IST IM PLUTO AN DER SPRITZBAR\n\nVor einem Jahr haben Danica und ihre Freunde einen Mann zum Sterben liegen lassen. Heute, auf ihrer Verlobungsfeier, landet ein Brief in ihrem Scho\u00df, \"Ich wei\u00df, was du letzten Sommer getan hast\". Die Runde reagiert darauf mit absoluter \u00dcberzeugung, \u201eWow, creepy \u2013 lass uns das ignorieren.\" Bis der erste stirbt. Ups.\n\nIch wei\u00df, was du letzten Sommer getan hast (2025) geht ca. 110 Minuten und ist ab 16 Jahren freigegeben. Wir bekommen die altbekannte Story, nur diesmal mit Dumm und D\u00fcmmer Figuren, die so unbegreiflich d\u00e4mlich handeln, dass man wirklich glaubt, die h\u00e4tten ihren Schulabschluss in einer Grabbelkiste gefunden.\nDie Handlung ist die gleiche wie immer, nur ohne Spannung, ohne Kreativit\u00e4t und ohne irgendwas, das wie ein Gehirn aussieht. Statt gruseliger Kills bekommt man Slapstick Dummheit am laufenden Band.\nWirklich, man k\u00f6nnte meinen, man sieht Figuren die sich alle ein und die selbe Gehirnzelle teilen.\nDie Figuren laufen gem\u00fctlich vor dem Killer weg, gehen nachts alleine raus, statt drinnen die T\u00fcr abzuschlie\u00dfen und lassen ihn entkommen, wenn er am Boden liegt, samt Messer. Pro dummer Entscheidung ein Shot, man w\u00e4re nach 20 Minuten klinisch tot.\nDer Killer selbst kann wahlweise stampfen wie ein Wasserb\u00fcffel oder sich lautlos teleportieren. Je nachdem, was der Plot gerade braucht.\nDas Finale ist dann die absolute Kr\u00f6nung, die Enth\u00fcllung ergibt keinen Sinn, ist an den Haaren herbeigezogen und so unw\u00fcrdig, dass man fast Mitleid mit dem Drehbuch bekommt. Kaum zu glauben das jemand bezahlt wird sowas zu schreiben.\nUnterm Strich bleibt ein Werk ohne Horror, ohne gute Kills und mit Figuren, die man von Minute eins an eigenh\u00e4ndig erw\u00fcrgen m\u00f6chte wenn sie den Mund auf machen.\n\n2/10 Punkten. Wer bitte benutzt eine Badebombe, die aussieht wie ein Periodenbecken? Genau. Diese Leute.",

A couple of good scenes, but a waste of potensial. \nThe script and the direction is the real problem (and Freddy Prinz jr who can`t act is way out of a paper bag). The twist is silly as f. \nJust watch the chase scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar in the original instead.",

While I appreciate this film going back to the films roots, following suit with some of the kill styles, and homages to the Croaker Queen... it overall was a disappointment. The new characters were not likeable, and they also ruined Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddy Prinze Jr characters and felt completely wrong for the ending. You can't make a hero character suddenly go villain just because you're out of ideas. I wish Hollywood would either stop reboots or stop adding the original cast and ruining it for the fans.",

    "text": "I was super excited to see this movie, especially with Madelyn Cline being in the movie. I was super into it at first, especially with the original characters being in the movie. However, once the podcaster got killed and said \"Its you\" I knew it had to be one of the original characters. I was HOPING it was not Ray as I was team Ray & Julie from the original. Well, I was at first not disappointed that it was Stevie, however it clicked when Ava said \"I don't know how she did it all herself.\" Then, I got very sad and knew it had to be Ray due to their connection. I did not like how easily they exposed Stevie on the boat, considering in the original it took FOREVER to show the killer whereas this one she literally just took off the hat. UGH. Then I HATED the excuse that Ray had for why he did it. Especially since in the original he was NOT about the fame or anything to do with the killings, especially after what he lost. However, Jennifer Love Hewitt KILLED IT! Love her and she hasn't aged! BUT, they did loop it back around and leave it at a good cliffhanger.",

Sarah was awesome tho, she looked good, delivered her limes good. Jennifer was also not cringe worthy. Over all it just didn't feel like the product we should have gotten after all the hype that went into it.",
