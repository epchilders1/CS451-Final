But for some reason the writing was off.  It just wasn't very interesting.  \n\nIf you're a fan of fantasy movies and like these actors, you could very well like this movie.  It's not offense, it's just not particularly compelling in any way.  On the contrary, it's fairly formulaic.  \n\nMade me wish I was watching The Big Lebowski instead.",

From the very first 2 scenes I was already incensed by then incredible injustice this movie puts on to call themselves based on these books. Like the Batman vs Superman movie of a similar time the production company mush have flipped through the first 5 books or so and just grabbed words they thought to be cool. The characters in this film are only based on the book characters by name alone there is no further resemblance. Universal and Legendary films failed this series and I wish for a tv reboot in the future to redeem this franchise and shine the light that Joseph Delaney deserves on this series.",

The little jokes were fun. Yes it was cheesy and full of clich\u00e9. But its fantasy and as such, a little cheese and clich\u00e9 is expected.\nI loved it. So did my kids. So did my husband.",
