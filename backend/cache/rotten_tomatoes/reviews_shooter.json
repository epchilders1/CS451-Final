But if you go into it without trying to pick apart every scene, it's just a blast from start to finish. \n\nIt has funny and likeable characters, many satisfying scenes, and some disturbingly convincing villains. Put your tinfoil hat on and enjoy the ride!",

    "text": "\"Shooter\" (2007) is a good action thriller from the director Antoine Fuqua. Mark Wahlberg stars here as US navy shooter that get cauth in a conspiracy. The plot here is pretty good and kept me involved until last frame. It does go a bit beyond typical good guy vs. bad guys here, but not that much. Were this film shines are in great cinematography, good editing, solid acting, and good directing. At running time 2 hours I did find this film to be engaging. All off the snipers stuff here is also very interesting to hear and to see.\n\nOverall, \"Shooter\" is one of the best films made by Antoine Fuqua. It's a solid genre film.",

They gave a movie about 3 people walking through the woods, stepping on leaves and arguing with each other for an hour and a half a whopping 86%. What was the name of that trash again... I can't remember... Oh yea, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT",

While it's not groundbreaking cinema, it's a solid action thriller that delivers on its promise of suspense and exciting action sequences.\n\nI'd say the film works primarily because it's based on a strong novel, and the film adaptation was a straightforward job, not trying to be anything more than it needed to be (for better or for worse).",
