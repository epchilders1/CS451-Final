    "text": "When several groups of tourists head out on an excursion to a volcanic island off the coast of New Zealand, they never take into consideration the possibility that their questionable judgement is going to come face-to-face with horrifically bad timing.  The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaree is a terrifying documentary of unimaginable circumstances, a harrowing story of survival and heroism, presented primarily through cellphone footage shot by the victims of the catastrophe as it happened.  With plenty of remarkable footage and some compelling personal stories, The Volcano is a memorable and impactful viewing experience.  The music score does get a bit tiresome at times, but that\u2019s a minor complaint about an otherwise solid documentary.",

Minute-by-minute footage and personal accounts give testimony to the tragedy that will claim 22 lives.'\n\nWhat makes this so scary is the amount of 1st person footage there is and how we watch people reacting to an experience which will change their lives for ever. And for some it'll end their lives or leave scars, both physical and mental, which there is no recovering from.\n\nIt's harrowing at times as the awe of nature's wonders turns into mortal terror. How do escape the inescapable? How do you face your own mortality in that moment?\n\nIt's a tremendously powerful documentary but it should come with a warning as some of the scenes you witness and hear are not for the faint of heart. Those who survived suffered the most terrible of injuries.\n\nTragic and terrifying.\n\n8/10",

    "text": "As \"The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaari\" (2022 release; 98 min) opens, we are introduced to a small community on the North Island of New Zealand. Thirty miles off the coast lies Whakaari, or \"White Island\", one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and a popular tourist attraction. It is \"December 9, 2019\" as tourists arrive on the island... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Rory Kennedy, who just earlier this year made the excellent \"Downfall: The Case Against Boeing\". Here she reflects on that fateful day in December, 2019, when a group of tourists visiting Whakaari find themselves trapped when the volcano erupts. Let me admit up front that I had not heard of this tragedy before seeing this. A couple of things struck: first and foremost, the beauty of that island (someone remarks \"it's like landing on the moon\"), resulting in absolutely stunning photography (and immediately wanting to add this island to my \"bucket list\" of places to visit). But also this: there is a reason why the island is called \"the most active volcano in the world\", as this type of eruption apparently happens with regularity (as in: also in 2016, also in 2013, etc.). It is telling that after the 2019 eruption, the island was closed permanently to visitors, Along the way, we get lots of talking heads, including tourists who survived, first responders, etc.\n\n\"The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaari\" had a brief US theatrical release, and then started streaming on Netflix, where I caught it. In and of itself there is nothing \"revolutionary\" about this disaster documentary, but watching the footage of this far flung location, literally at the end of the world, makes this worthwhile. Of course don't take my word for it, so I readily encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",

This true story about the Whakaari volcano erupting while tourists were on the island was dramatic, intense, and tragic. It's about fighting to survive and hoping you make it out alive.
