    "text": "5+ stars.  Rotten Tomatoes is exactly what they're called - ROTTEN!  How do you people justify giving a movie not only praising God, but promoting CA (yes, that's the medical abbreviation for cancer from a medical professional)  awareness and sharing stories of battles   won over CA only 25%?  Shame on all of you who contributed to that low rating.  As usual & with any movie regarding God, the user score is much higher because mainstream America doesn't live in your politically correct, liberal, isolationist, self-righteous bubble.  It was a very good movie full of love, courage and selflessness.  no foul language, political correctness & best of all, the breaking of an addiction to alcohol.  Perfect for the whole family, and you 'judges' as well if you will climb down off your little rock.  You're not the masters of this universe,  but mark my words - criticizing in an attempt to turn people away from a film like this, one day you will stand before God - we'll see who gets declared rotten then, only after you've waited too late.  From a proud, middle class east coast Reagan Republican, Donald Trump supporter - I would give 10 stars if it were possible.  You spoke your piece, now there's mine.",

He had gotten everyone to start writing Letters to God.  \n\nWhen Tyler had passed, his best friend Samantha had put up a mailbox just for Tyler, and when you wrote a Letter to God,  you put it in the mailbox. \n\nI honestly love this movie!",

It gave me another knowledge on how God works in our life, either through the problems we are facing and also through the people around us. It made see how God uses our sufferings, pain, weakness, afflictions and hopelessness to his purpose and glory. This movie shows how ONE ACT OF FAITH CAN CHANGE THOUSANDS OF LIVES.",

The characters are barely developed, so we can't be attached to them and what they feel, the story is pretty much uni-dimensional and the message it tries to tell is obscured by these facts. Sadly, this movie is based on a real case of cancer disease, and it doens't accomplish the message? That's unforgivable.",
