    "text": "This is the most accurate representation of what life is like deployed. This unit in particular had an extremely bloody tour but the movie itself focuses on the entirety of their tour and not just the gruesome event that ended it. They looked at aspects beyond the deployment, in getting care and continuing the battle once they were back, something that very much is not touched on and is needed more. I have been to some of the areas here on my tour and think they did an amazing job of choosing a location to depict afghanistan. 2009-2010 was the bloodiest years of the occupation of Afghanistan. The way the troops talk to one another was perfect, the sudden loss of a leader, how that came out of nowhere jarring troop morale hit home for me personally. It comes out of nowhere, hits hard and fast then nothing but the silence and a screaming mind was depicted accurately too. For me this is the one film that is the most realistic depiction of life overseas as a soldier.",

    "text": "The Outpost (2019)\nGreat War Movie Based on a True Story\n(11,850 \u2013 24 Jul 2025 \u2013 by Claudio Carvalho)\nDuring the War in Afghanistan, a helicopter brings a group of soldiers to the Kamdesh Outpost located in a valley surrounded by mountains. The base is totally vulnerable and a death trap and the Taliban frequently shoot at the troop from the mountains. In 2006, a horde of Taliban attack massively the outnumbered outpost and the fifty-three soldiers need to resist until air support comes. \n\u201cThe Outpost\u201d (2019) is a great war movie based on a true story of Battle of Kamdesh, were a few American soldiers resisted to attack of the enemy. The screenplay is very well written and shows the bond created among the soldiers. The battle scene is magnificent and gives the sensation to the viewer that he is watching a real battle. I am not military, and I do not understand how a base is installed surrounded by mountains, jeopardizing the lives of the military. The conclusion showing the actors and the real soldiers is heartbreaking. My vote is eight.\nTitle (Brazil): \u201cPosto de Combate\u201d (\u201cCombat Post\u201d)\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",

It also has its fair share of intense and even emotional moments. It\u2019s consistently entertaining throughout and worth the watch it\u2019s a good little gem on Netflix and it\u2019s leaving pretty soon do check it out if you\u2019re into he\u2019s kind of movies. Also the stay tuned for the interviews at the end of the credits.",

The acting is subpar and it\u2019s just a bunch of sensationalism if you are a military buff you will just shake your head for the whole movie. Better ways to tie up two hours of your time.",

Showing the rawness, the trauma, the deaths and everything that was experienced in a battle so that the public feels sad. Because despite being a movie, you know that this happened in real life, and it makes you sad when you see that these soldiers lived in the flesh. Highly recommended",

    "text": "82%. True story about a basically indefensible base camp at the base of a mountain in Afghanistan, protecting from the taliban trying to enter from Pakistan. Documents four or so head officers that head things for portions of the film. Pretty intense throughout with the Taliban constantly coming down the mountain and ends with a long battle. Cool to see the comraderie amongst the guys but not much real character development. Don\u2019t get to know anyone too well. Good movie but not great. 3/5 on rewatch",
