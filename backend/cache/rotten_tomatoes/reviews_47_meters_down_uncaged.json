No real connection or some sort of relationship was made with the characters from a viewers pov. Dialogue was horrible and what makes it worse was they had some smart parts of the movie then ruined it by the stupidity. They knew the sharks was blind so obviously it can only rely on its hearing; why would you have them screaming every time they see the sharks. Other than that the jump scares were decent.",

While 47 Meters Down: Uncaged continues to have decent ideas such as underwater cave exploration and a claustrophobia theme, it\u2019s difficult to trust the film due to its unlikable characters and its reliance on clich\u00e9d horror silliness.\n\nGrading: D",

I don\u2019t think the Director understands how underwater currents work. The last 15 minutes are truly terrible. The great white sharks must have blunt teeth. Poor",

I like the characters but they were SO stupid and come on if you know the shark relies on sound why are you screaming like you WANT to be murdered. Couple of jumpscares but not so many that it felt the movie relied on it.",

    "text": "I have not watched the first movie and I just watched this one I have to say it wasn't the worst movie but there were somethings I didn't like about this. For instance, we had no time to emotionally connect with the characters and all the girls were a pain to watch. Also, there was way too much screaming every time they saw a shark they just had to scream. Just be quiet so the sharks don't attack you and try saving some oxygen by not hyperventilating every time you think you'll never escape or if someone dies. Plus there were some people who I think didn't deserve to die. Like that guy who was minding his own business listening to music or that one girls father however, ALEXA, she can die in a hole she was annoying as hell and got all of the girls into this mess. Then there's that one girl who was selfish and decided to climb on the rope will Alexa was on it   and then screwed everyone over by knocking down the ascender, good thing she died. I'm not sure if ben should've died because I kind of skipped like the first ten minutes of the movie because I got bored of it. Those two girls at the end of the movie those people were honestly not that bad because the blonde one was so loyal she jumped in to the water to save her friend and she went in first when they heard music, not to mention she was at the front of the group the entire time she was the best of the group. Then there's that other one I think her name is Mia I didn't really notice her doing anything so that probably means she wasn't annoying so It's a good thing they didn't kill her off. Finally who has a swimming pool at the front entrance of a school.",
