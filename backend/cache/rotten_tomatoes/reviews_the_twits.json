    "text": "The animation - scary. It\u2019s almost like Coraline. I thought this was a fun movie to show my class. I teach 2nd graders. Three of the kids asked me to turn it off after 15 minutes because they were scared. And I understand why. This is not a good kids movie! It\u2019s super creepy with a very underdeveloped plot! The animation is creepy and the whole opening plot with gross meat contaminating waters and innocent creatures in cages being forced to cry by evil hillbillies is NOT child material. What were the directors and producers thinking when they made this???",

Speaking of toilets, the excessive use of toilet humor was unbecoming. Pick an idea and stick with it instead of making us sit through your barfed up movie.",
