Back to Syrian Productions has a habit of introducing characters like Aunt Jackie and Toby but not bringing them back for subsequent sequels. The other problem I have with this film is that the Chipmunks are sent to a high school instead of an elementary school. After all they are supposed to be children. My favorite scenes are the one with Toby. Because when Anne Jackie has a problem Toby steps in to help take care of the Chipmunks. We learned that Toby is a shy awkward guy who likes a particular girl and the Chipmunks help him come out of his shell. The film is a mess on one hand because of Ian Hawke. He's the sleazy record producer that tried to harm the Chipmunks and later the Chipettes. He goes as far as to break into an empty apartment and assume living there. He even goes as far as the dress and drag at the end of the movie to play fake being the Chipettes. Some of the antics of Ian Hawke are questionable at best. If it weren't for the Toby scenes I wouldn't watch this film at all. Characters like Aunt Jackie and Toby get short changed while Dave has often abrasive at times the 5:00 shadow and is very abrasive at times",

Your old decrepit tour guide Gary randomly takes you to a meat market and you don't want to be there. You hate it so you go to the thrift shop down the street. You take a gander around and then you find Alvin and The Chipmunks The Squeakuel. You think its silly and then you remember that the bus ride home needs a movie playing on the Tv\u2019s, turns out you purchase it and then 2 days later as the bus driver takes you home you are subjected to the unimaginable torture of enduring this wet fart of a film. My life would be better is i had not left the market for the thrift store, so i am telling you to listen to Gary",

It is a kids movie, it is for children. 21% is a ridiculous rating for a kids movie that I remember being enjoyable when I was a kid. Upon recent rewatch, the movie wasn't the greatest I'd ever seen by any means, but I have the self-awareness to realize that I am not the target audience for this movie and can't expect it to still feel the same when I'm older and more cynical.",
