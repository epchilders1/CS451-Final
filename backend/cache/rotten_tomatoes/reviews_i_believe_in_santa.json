    "text": "This movie was a surprisingly worthwhile one that made my husband and I think.  The movie concept had a deeper meaning for sure\u2014that of reconciling different opinions or beliefs\u2014of choosing unity instead of division\u2026.and all in the fun medium of Santa.   It was one that we wholeheartedly agree with.   For the sake of families looking for a fun film for those family members that believe\u2014this film directly challenges all those beliefs\u2026and then it directly challenges all the nay sayers right back.  It's kind of the premise.  Some choose to believe, and some choose not to.  It's a cute story and cute way of making us all think introspectively about our beliefs or opinions, and how we treat others that have different beliefs or opinions than ours.",

    "text": "While obviously not a great film, it had my family and I laughing hysterically and rewatching scenes over and over again because of how ridiculous they were. \"I AM A MAN!\" was our favorite line that was probably not meant to be funny, but we were laughing so hard that we had tears in our eyes. We replayed that scene probably ten times or more. So many parts of this movie are just so silly and cringey that you can't help laughing at the absurdity of it. \n\nOn the upside, it does make you think about how illogical a lot of beliefs are from the outside (i.e. believing in Santa is like believing in God), which was an interesting point. Also, the cringe factor makes this a fun movie to laugh at and comment on throughout the whole thing. \n\nOne big thing we couldn't get over was how Tom was setting off our gaydar, especially because of how little chemistry he and the female lead had, only to discover that they are married in real life. We were floored! And then we laughed some more!\n\nOverall, we had fun watching it last year and rewatching it this year. If you don't take this movie seriously and can laugh at it/ with it and appreciate its absurdity, then this movie is for you. Also, you can't be creeped out by eyes. Trust me on that one. This movie has lots of wide-eyed staring that can be uncomfortable. But again, that just adds to the funny weirdness, if you're the kind of person who enjoys that kind of thing, which I am!",

The writing and acting is completely horrendous, to the point where you can't tell if the lead is meant to be in love with his buddy, or the single mother he somehow started dating. \n\nOne of those films that will keep you laughing, for all the wrong reasons. Enjoy watching this to roast this complete blunder with your friends !!!",

If I want to zone out and watch a predictable, silly Christmas movie, this is it. It's a totally fine movie. I was entertained. The actress does have weird facial expressions but whatever, not enough to impact me. Bottom line \u2014 if youre the kind of person that's into low-drama, predictable, cheesy rom coms, you'll probably like this movie",

There was no chemistry there at all. That wasn't the worst part about this movie though. I didn't like how they were making comparisons between believing in Santa Claus and believing in religion as if they were the same thing. They were making it sound like someone believing in God was just as ridiculous as an adult seriously believing in Santa Claus. The whole movie came across as a dig at religion.",
