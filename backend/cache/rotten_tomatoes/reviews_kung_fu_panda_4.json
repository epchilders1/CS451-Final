    "text": "This movie was the weakest of the franchise. But I still enjoyed it quite a bit. The positives: the plot was fine, Jack Black and Akwafina did great voice acting and humour. Their chemistry was pretty good. The villain had an interest concept and design. The movie was less funny than others but still got me a couple of laughs, the battles were fun and entertaining. The animation and visuals always gorgeous and beautiful. The return of villains were fine but mostly Tai Lung was the best and his redemption arc. I also liked the dad stuffs. The negatives: Its the weakest of the franchise, the villain was a good premise but not executed really well and her motivations are kind of lazy and stupid. The lack of the furious 5 didn't annoy me too much but I still wished to see them more than just in the post credits scene and the pacing was a bit off. In conclusion, this movie is the weakest of the franchise. But still fun and entertaining to watch alone or with family and don't have too high expectations.",

La canci\u00f3n de los cr\u00e9ditos tambi\u00e9n es de lo mejor de\u00a0esta\u00a0pel\u00edcula",

I noticed a difference in the pacing of the movie making it feel rushed. The excluded furious five gives me this feeling.",

Also the moral compass in this movie doesn\u2019t make any sense. Po spent the last 3 movies fighting criminals and now he\u2019s fighting with a criminal. Literally fighting innocent people who were cheated their money in a game. \ud83d\ude2d",
