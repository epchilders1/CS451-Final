He has cheated on his wife with her..yeah right like that would happen in real life. They don't fit together at all and she has no sexyness at all. So what's the erotic part? Maybe the stalker part fits her but the femme fatal part absolutely does not",

But hey Ealy and Swank are names that make you want to watch until you can\u2019t get past the club scene where he\u2019s into her and she\u2019s into him, they didn\u2019t pull that off which sets up the entire movie for ALWAYS missing the mark, I want to unsee it and I saw it for FREE well some of it, I switch to Lioness which is my new favorite show",

But....then all of a sudden Hilary Swank appeared and I was glued to the TV. This is a guilty pleasure for sure - clich\u00e9 and predictable - but still enjoyable for only one reason - Swank! Amazing actress.",

I would have rated it a bit higher, but I didn't feel that any of the characters had that much realistic on-screen chemistry together. Still a pretty solid watch.",
