Loved Waltz's father figure character in this, it was so wholesome and sweet. The visuals and special effects were cool too.",

With exceptional visual effects and a virtually perfect main character with genuine vulnerability, a heart of gold, an immense power to fight evil and a full character development arc, this film qualifies as one of my top few favorites.  Its strength of heart and emotional power actually brought some tears to my eyes.  It does the early chapters of the original manga justice and shows that live action anime movies CAN work!  My favorite cyberpunk movie, hands down!",

    "text": "Alita: Battle Angel (2019)\nGreat Screenplay, Cast and Special Effects\n(11,887 \u2013 13 Jul 2019 / 16 Aug 2025 \u2013 by Claudio Carvalho)\nIn 2563, three hundred years after the war \"The Fall\", the mysterious scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds part of a female cyborg in a junkyard and brings to his laboratory. He finds that her human brain is amnestic but intact and gives the name of his deceased daughter Alita (Rosa Salazar) to the cyborg. Alita meets on the street Dr. Ido\u00b4s ex-wife Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who is also a scientist that works to the powerful Zapan (Ed Skrein). Then, she befriends the young Hugo (Keean Johnson), who brings cyborg\u00b4s parts to Dr. Ido, and learns that both dream on moving to the floating city of Zalem. Hugo teaches Alita how to play Motorball and she learns that the champion of the Motorball Tournament moves to Zalem. Soon Alita discovers that Dr. Ido is a hunter warrior and after finding her cyborg body in a crashed spaceship, she decides to become also a hunter warrior, but Dr. Ido refuses to replace her body. Who was Alita and what is the secret of the cyborg body found by Alita? \n\"Alita: Battle Angel\" is a sci-fi adventure with great screenplay, cast and special effects. The Japanese anime of an amnestic cyborg that finds who she was is engaging to any sci-fi fan. Dr. Ido is a sort of cyborg Dr. Frankenstein, and the direction of Robert Rodriguez is entertaining as usual. The conclusion indicates that there will be a sequel. It seems that the acquisition of Fox by Disney caused the delay of the expected sequel. My vote is eight.  \nTitle (Brazil): \"Alita: Anjo de Combate\" (\"Alita: Battle Angel\")\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",
