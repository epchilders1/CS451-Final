    "text": "I have so much to say about this movie. I hated it and it was a masterpiece. Scorsese builds suspense in a way that\u2019s almost cruel. The moment Travis thinks he\u2019s picking up Betsy, and the camera refuses to pan to the back seat for what feels like four minutes, is brilliant. The tense music, the drifting daydream, the slow realization that someone else is in the car \u2014 it\u2019s perfect. The same goes for the TV-tilt scene. The way it wobbles in limbo, neither falling nor settling, mirrors Travis\u2019s mind. When it finally tips over, it feels like the moment he breaks.\n\nTravis might be one of the greatest antiheroes ever written. He\u2019s a terrible, weak-minded man with no real thoughts or convictions of his own. He\u2019s the hollow outline of a man without purpose. What infuriates me is that, by the end, he\u2019s celebrated. Even Betsy comes back, almost admiring him. The movie feels like a commentary on how easily society elevates the wrong kind of person.\n\nWatching him as someone who works hard to be the right kind of good makes it maddening. There\u2019s a surreal quality to the final stretch, almost like the whole thing might be Travis\u2019s fantasy \u2014 a dream of being recognized because he has nothing else to anchor himself to. And that ambiguity is part of what makes the movie both brilliant and deeply uncomfortable.",

But when I watched it, I actually understood it, unlike some of Scorsese's other movies I've seen. And it doesn't have an excessive runtime.",

    "text": "Taxi Driver is nothing short of a masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever made. Scorsese\u2019s direction, combined with Robert De Niro\u2019s unforgettable performance, crafts a dark, searing portrait of urban alienation that remains unmatched decades later. Its exploration of obsession, loneliness, and moral decay is timeless, and every frame pulses with meticulous artistry.\n\nArguably Scorsese\u2019s finest work, Taxi Driver is a film even its own director cannot surpass \u2014 a perfect synthesis of narrative, style, and raw psychological intensity. Bold, uncompromising, and unforgettable, it is cinema at its absolute pinnacle.",

The cinematography is outstanding, especially for the time period. But it\u2019s extremely boring really weird and awkward. The main action scene at the end is horrible. \n\nThis is just a check the block movie to say Yep I seen the classic that shouldn\u2019t be a classic\u2026.",

Soft and indulgent like a piece by art school students (sorry)  Just been in grittier situations, Harvey Keitel just didn't cut it as a pimp.  Part Woody Allen.  Just a bit disjointed in the end.  Glad I've seen it so I can say I've seen the great classic movie.  Slow paced but wasn't necessarily bored until right at the 'shocking' climax.  Not brave enough to have a tragic ending.",

    "text": "Watching this film for the first time, I understood the meaning of the term \"masterpiece.\" While watching it, I was bored, not paying much attention, and just waiting for it to end. The next day, I found myself on the train listening to the soundtrack and rewatching scenes over and over again. For over a week, I couldn't get that film out of my head; it was stuck there and wouldn't go away. At that moment, I realized that this film was the best I'd ever seen. It had impacted me personally like nothing else. I watched it again years later, one morning before going to university, and that was the definitive confirmation: this was my favorite film, but this time, it entertained me every second.",
