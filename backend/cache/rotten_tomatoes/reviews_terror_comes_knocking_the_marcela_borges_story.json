    "text": "I have never made a movie review in my life,I was so utterly disappointed with the level of acting or lack for would be a better statement.the wife was totally out of her comfort zone in this role.she truly cried about 20+times and I swear I almost gave the movie another watch just to she if she ever dropped a single tear.**Spoiler Alert** she never she a single solitary tear.smfh \nOne more thing stood out to me was the fact that she got nfl field goal kicked in the stomach 2+ times, punched and to top it off she was shot in back/stomach and the baby freaking lived\u2026.give me a break. I liked her in other roles but as I stated earlier I don\u2019t feel this role was in her theatric repertoire and her agent should be fired for allowing her to delve so far out of her comfort zone  to put out such a performance that many would find it hard to argue that this was even a  screen Worthy performance.terrible casting and the director should take this and truly read the comments and learn from this visual disappointment in every aspect.",

My 4 year old cousin could\u2019ve done a better job. Seriously it was painful to watch. The tone of voice of all the assailants was so off\u2014they would like say things that were meant to sound aggressive and scary, and instead would sound calm/almost timid. Their faces would not match their words. My God, I\u2019ve never seen worse acting. 0/10 I\u2019m mad that\u2019s not a rating option on here.",

    "text": "The only terror that came knocking was the pain in my head while watching this travesty. This movie should be referenced as an example of what not to do. I hate when directors and actors are so over the top and try to throw a hundred things at the audience that all add up to nothing. So many details missed and illogical occuences, and this starts with the child opening the door in the first place. It just continues to spiral downward throughout the movie. 200k ransom, really? GTFOH, and this was to be split between 4-5 criminals. The bank scene between customer, bank-teller, and manager (Laughable) I worked as a teller decades ago, and the stacks the manager presented was well more than 57k (each would have been 10k) Details people, details....smdh. Why would she walk in house and throw the money on table, and say SHE DID IT? Also, they would have known she didn't have the amount before going to bank as they made her transfer all funds to one account ( just nonsensical). God, there are just too many lame things about this movie to continue \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude34",

Please do not watch unless you enjoy bad movies or want a reference of a bad movie with bad acting. The only good thing I have to say is the movie was written and directed by High schoolers so kudos to them. Other than that its a bad movie.",

He barked so well I believed it. zero tomatoes.\nI wanna know why the neighbor who was almost 9 shows up at the end of the movie with a baby that should have been much older than the baby that Marcella had. Nobody in production could have given her an older baby? Nobody caught that?",

    "text": "Netflix\u2019s Terror Comes Knocking: The Marcela Borges Story is a film that lures you in with the quiet, wholesome familiarity of a Hallmark drama \u2014 but make no mistake, it quickly reveals itself as something far darker and more unsettling. Based on the real-life events of Marcela Borges and her family, this drama-thriller explores the terrifying ordeal of an ordinary household thrust into extraordinary danger.\n\nThe story follows Borges and her family after they are violently hijacked by a group of criminals who believe they are sitting on $200,000. What begins as intimidation escalates into kidnapping, torment, and relentless psychological pressure as the captors force the family to find ways to produce money they don\u2019t have. It\u2019s a scenario that feels chillingly plausible, and the weight of knowing this is rooted in real events makes it all the more disturbing.\n\nThe direction is commendable in how it sustains tension, drawing the viewer into the claustrophobic fear that grips the family. At the same time, the screenplay struggles with consistency. There are stretches of heavy dialogue that bog down the pacing, leaving scenes that feel stagnant when they should heighten suspense. At times, the narrative is either too vague in where it\u2019s headed or far too obvious, eliminating any sense of surprise.\n\nWhile the performances keep the emotional core alive, the execution often feels uneven. The fight sequences and moments of rescue, which should deliver explosive catharsis, lack the necessary intensity to reflect the full horror of Borges\u2019 lived experience. One can\u2019t help but feel that the film waters down her ordeal, perhaps due to budget constraints or a desire to avoid going too dark, but the result is a loss of dramatic weight.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the movie still manages to hold attention. It\u2019s engaging enough to watch once, but unlikely to warrant a rewatch. The dialogue-heavy stretches make it more of a slow-burn drama than a gripping thriller, which might leave audiences divided. Those looking for a riveting, edge-of-your-seat experience may walk away underwhelmed, while those simply seeking a grounded drama based on real events may find enough here to appreciate.\n\nIn the end, Terror Comes Knocking: The Marcela Borges Story lands somewhere in between. It\u2019s a sobering look at a true story of survival, but one that ultimately feels restrained when it should have been unflinching.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nA decent, time-passing watch with moments of genuine tension, but not the definitive retelling Marcela Borges\u2019 story deserves.",

I only give props because it was written and directed by highschoolers so good job on that accomplishment but otherwise absolutely horrible movie. Such a waste of my time.

    "text": "this might quite literally be the worst movie I have ever seen. The only good actor was the man and the child. The plot was so unrealistic. I understand this is based on a true story and I get full respect to the family that actually went through it, but the directors and the writers did not care about this movie. It has nothing to do with the budget or anything. Spoiler but why didn\u2019t the wife recognize the girl when she first saw her face after she did her taxes for two years and how was she already in surgery before the husband got in the ambulance. And how could the cop have possibly known those details that she was okay. These are just some things I have seen but throughout the whole movie.  I literally have never written a movie review and I created an account just to talk about how bad this movie was.",
