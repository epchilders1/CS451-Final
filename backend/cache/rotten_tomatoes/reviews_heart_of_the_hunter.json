    "text": "From the very bottom of the Netflix barrel, this badly directed and edited movie also suffers from a muddled script, with a silly and unbelievable plot that is simplistic when summarized at the end, but absurd and convoluted while unfolding and riddled with disjointed flashbacks and voice-overs, One has to give the actors credit for trying to put some life into the film, but no amount of acting can overcome this fractured production. The funding came from Netflix, but was this movie actually made by professionals?",

    "text": "Heart of the Hunter (2024) is another generic Netflix action thriller except this time it's in South Africa. I liked hearing the Zulu and Xhosa languages from the strong actors, However, the story is nearly incoherent between the erratic editing and poor writing. None of the characters mattered to me and I could not describe the plot to you with a gun to my head. The direction is frustrating for the storytelling, but the action scenes are momentarily exciting. The actors try their best, but this was frustrating and ultimately boring.",

There\u2019s never a sense as to why any of this is happening and why they all do the dumbest things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s feels so boring and the acting and dialogue are very subpar.",
