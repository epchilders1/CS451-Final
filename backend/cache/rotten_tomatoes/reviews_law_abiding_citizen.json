Really enjoy the story and seeing a smart man's way to vengeance for what happened to him and his family. Good cast - fun to see Jamie Foxx in a role like this as a powerful attorney being subdued by this man. Some serious plot holes around timing and of course entirely unrealistic, but if you don't want to nitpick, it's a very entertaining. 4/5 rewatch",

    "text": "No, it's not high art cinema.  It's a very entertaining movie with strong ethical dilemmas that many people come across (more and more frequently). Perhaps not on this scale (i.e., family murdered) but many people can sympathize. Not sure what the 26% review is about, given the garbage that is rated 70+%.  The overall concept is good.  The dialogue could have been improved in a few spots which would have improved the film dramatically.  And a few formulaic scenes.",

That takes some serious incompetence to make the deal the writers gave him.  Maybe if they had skipped the rape\u2026 but wait, this is Hollywood.  Still trying to figure out why we got a full back nude shot of Butler.  No apparent reason other than an ass and ab fest.",

Probably why I liked it so much!",

    "text": "Law Abiding Citizen (2009) is one of those films that catches you completely off guard. You go in expecting a standard revenge thriller, but what you get instead is a gripping, emotionally charged story that\u2019s as intelligent as it is brutal. I stumbled across it without knowing much about it, and I can honestly say I was blown away.\n\nThe film stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton, a man whose wife and daughter are savagely murdered during a home invasion. When the justice system fails him\u2014allowing one of the killers to walk free thanks to a plea deal brokered by prosecutor Nick Rice (played by Jamie Foxx)\u2014Clyde decides to take matters into his own hands. What follows is a series of shocking, meticulously planned acts of vengeance that turn the entire city, and the justice system itself, upside down.\n\nFrom the very first scene, the emotional weight is palpable. Clyde isn\u2019t your typical action-movie vigilante\u2014he\u2019s a broken, grieving father whose pain drives every move he makes. Butler delivers one of his most powerful performances here, combining raw emotion with a calm, calculated menace. You sympathize with his loss, even as you\u2019re horrified by his methods. There\u2019s something deeply human about his rage, which makes his transformation into a master manipulator both tragic and fascinating.\n\nJamie Foxx\u2019s performance as Nick Rice serves as the perfect counterbalance. He\u2019s a man who lives by the rules, a career-driven prosecutor who believes in the system\u2014until it\u2019s turned against him. His dynamic with Butler is electric; their psychological chess match drives the entire movie. The tension between them never lets up, and each exchange feels like a battle of wits and morals.\n\nThe supporting cast elevates the film even further. Viola Davis, though in a smaller role, brings her signature intensity and gravitas, grounding the film\u2019s more explosive moments with emotional realism. Her scenes, especially those confronting the moral breakdown of the system, are incredibly effective. Colm Meaney also delivers as Detective Dunnigan, bringing a gritty, world-weary presence that fits perfectly within the film\u2019s tone.\n\nDirector F. Gary Gray deserves immense credit for how he orchestrates this story. The pacing is tight, the visuals are sharp, and the atmosphere is unrelenting. He manages to balance big, shocking moments with quieter, introspective scenes that make you question who\u2019s really right and wrong. It\u2019s not just a revenge story\u2014it\u2019s a study in morality, power, and how far someone will go when justice fails them.\n\nWhat makes Law Abiding Citizen so unique is its unpredictability. Every time you think you know what\u2019s going to happen, the film takes another unexpected turn. The way Clyde executes his plan\u2014often from within a jail cell\u2014is both disturbing and brilliant. It leaves you constantly wondering how he\u2019s managing to pull off these elaborate acts from behind bars, and the answers, when they come, are both shocking and satisfying.\n\nThe movie also raises important ethical questions. Is vengeance ever justified? What does justice mean when the system itself is flawed? And how far can a person go before they become the very thing they despise? The screenplay doesn\u2019t shy away from these heavy themes, and while the action is thrilling, it\u2019s the psychological and moral tension that makes this film stand out.\n\nThe cinematography and score further amplify the tension. The use of muted tones, sharp contrasts, and deliberate pacing gives the movie a haunting, almost claustrophobic feel. The music builds perfectly with the suspense, making even the quiet moments feel charged with energy.\n\nRewatching Law Abiding Citizen or even thinking about it afterward leaves you questioning your own sense of justice. Would you do the same thing in Clyde\u2019s position? Would you fight the system\u2014or destroy it? That\u2019s what makes the film so effective\u2014it doesn\u2019t just entertain you, it provokes you.\n\nFor a movie I stumbled upon by accident, it quickly became one of the most captivating thrillers I\u2019ve seen in years. It\u2019s smart, shocking, and emotional in all the right ways. The performances are top-tier, the direction is precise, and the story grabs you from start to finish.\n\nIf you\u2019re into psychological thrillers, revenge dramas, or morally complex films that keep you guessing, Law Abiding Citizen is absolutely worth your time. It\u2019s more than just a movie\u2014it\u2019s an experience that leaves you questioning what justice really means.",

The acting was solid and Butler is great in the film- although some parts seem pretty random and unnecessary. It is interesting how far most people were okay with a person going if his family had been wronged.",

But in this movie his character represents ALL what I so deeply want to see GONE FOREVER in modern \"justice\" system. FOREVER.\nAnd yet [SPOILER WARNING] at the end this despicable pos oversmarts the super mega ultra genius who is a wonderful actor AND a wonderful character!?\nWHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????\nWHO TF thought that this was a good idea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????\nWHY did they think that ANYBODY with a brain and a heart would EVER rather identify in Foxx's character than in Butler's one?\nLOSERS!\nSTOP MAKING STORIES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO LET GO OF YOUR MORAL COWARDICE AND TAKE THE PREMISE TO THE VERY END!",
