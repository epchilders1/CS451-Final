    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (2023) is a pure fun. It does not reinvent the wheel in any department and it is the safest film possible. Still at running time 1 h 22 min (perfect for youngest ones with a span of attention equal to a tic toc video), i found myself enjoying it mildly. It does look very colorful, and seen at home on a big TV with great HDR will blow you away in terms of colors. Story - not so much. It is basically a commercial for Nintendo's Mario games and that is it. Still, humor is there, and its hugh energy and some smart writing save it and made it very watchable.\n\nOverall, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is fun enough to see it. It is short, colorful and funny enough to recommend it.",

    "text": "My cousin and sister wanted to watch it badly. I told them I didn't want to because I did not like the cast choosing for the film. I felt like Chris Pratt was too white to play an Italian with a thick accent. It should've been John Turturro and his brother Nicholas Turturro as Mario and Luigi. Bowser should've been probably James Wood because his voice is silly and he usually plays the antagonist. I love the Mario Franchise (Super Mario Galaxy being one of my favorites and the movie will critically flop and I am sad they will be destroying one of my favorite games of all time), but I just found this movie bad. None of the cast fit their roles. The graphics were on point. For me this is a one time and discard film.",
