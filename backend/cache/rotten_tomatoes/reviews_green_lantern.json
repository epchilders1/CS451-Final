    "text": "Green Lantern is a film that had so much potential but collapsed under the weight of excessive CGI and uneven execution. Ryan Reynolds, while a talented actor, struggles to balance the comedic energy that makes him great as Deadpool with the gravitas needed for Hal Jordan. The result is a performance that sometimes veers into unintentional parody, making it hard to take the character seriously in what was meant to be a heroic, epic narrative.\n\nBlake Lively is serviceable in her role\u2014charming and attractive\u2014but her character doesn\u2019t have much substance to latch onto. The film\u2019s reliance on CGI-heavy visuals overshadows any genuine character development or storytelling. Scenes that could have carried emotional weight or tension instead feel sterile and artificial, leaving the audience disengaged.\n\nThe screenplay is a major downfall. The story is muddled, pacing is off, and dialogue often fails to land. With so much green screen and digital effects dominating the film, the narrative becomes almost impossible to follow at times. Critical story beats get lost in the spectacle, and what could have been thrilling moments are reduced to visual noise.\n\nDirector Martin Campbell seems overwhelmed by the visual demands, unable to balance the CGI spectacle with coherent storytelling. This results in a film that\u2019s more exhausting to watch than entertaining, as the focus on effects comes at the expense of character depth and meaningful plot progression.\n\nThe only redeeming aspect of Green Lantern is the off-screen chemistry that developed between Reynolds and Lively, which became a talking point for audiences but does little to redeem the film itself. Otherwise, there\u2019s very little in terms of enjoyment, excitement, or lasting impact.\n\nUltimately, Green Lantern is a cautionary tale of how over-reliance on CGI, combined with a weak screenplay and uneven performances, can sink a potentially great superhero film. It\u2019s a movie best forgotten\u2014watch it only if you\u2019re curious, but don\u2019t expect anything close to a classic superhero experience.",

    "text": "Ah the infamous Green Lantern, the punching bag of the internet and Ryan Reynolds (often in Deadpool form). It's a fun movie with its share of cheesy moments. The film gets a bad rap but I find it a bit underrated. It's certainly not going to win any awards but I found it fairly enjoyable. It has that campy early 2010s vibe that is endearing. Watching Green Lantern is like steeping into a time capsule. Its flaws, like the dated CGI and corny dialogue, gives it a certain kind of charm that makes it interesting to look back on. It was a different type of era for comic book movies that I have a lot of nostalgia for, despite the shortcomings. Definitely a step above several other comic book films with similar ratings.",

Also, technically it was a moderate financial success. They just didn\u2019t too much money and messed themselves up. They should\u2019ve gone cheap for the first one, marketed and THEN did a bigger budget film for the sequel.",

Great cinematography and GCI, lots of action and enough twists to keep it interesting. This movie gets a lot of negative attention for trivial reasons, it's a MOVIE! Not the star in the DC universe, granted, but good enough",

If we think in Marvel, if this movie was the 24th between 50, no one would cares at all (like Shang Chi o Eternals, movies that no one really cares but didn't harm Marvel at all)",
