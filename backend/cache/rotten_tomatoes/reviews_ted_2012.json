I'm not going to deny that the movie is vulgar or has inappropriate content, But as I said before, it's quite funny if we look at it from another perspective.  \n\n~Kevin",

But I did laugh quite a bit, and I could definitely relate (I'm Jewish, I loved Flash Gordon and that Queen soundtrack as a kid, and I think we all went through a pot smoking phase.)  PS Memo to Seth MacFarlane - great minds think alike :D  Not only did he cast personal fav Mila Kunis as the leading lady here, he chose her blonde alter ego Amanda Seyfried for the sequel!",
