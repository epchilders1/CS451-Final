So utterly predictable and trite, I truly feel sorry for the famous actors like Brenda Vaccaro,  Talia Shire and Lorraine Bracco, who were evidently roped into this production, thinking it would have more than a millimeter of depth.",

    "text": "Watching \"Nonnas\" is like getting a warm hug from an old friend. This film lovingly tells the true story of Joey, who channels his grief and longing into something beautiful: a restaurant powered by the culinary wisdom of Italian grandmothers. The real-life footage at the end grounds it all with genuine emotion, reminding viewers that the journey wasn\u2019t just a script\u2014it was Joey\u2019s way of honoring his mom and grandmother.\n\n\"Nonnas\" gently navigates the complexities of loss, forgiveness, and regret, while also celebrating friendship, risk, and\u2014most powerfully\u2014love. Every scene is infused with heart and soul, steering clear of the violence and cynicism often found in modern dramas. Instead, it offers a refreshing, wholesome antidote: an invitation to slow down and savor life\u2019s simpler, richer moments.\n\nIf your brain needs a shot of genuine feel-good chemistry, let \"Nonnas\" dose you with hope and comfort. It\u2019s a reminder that love and food can heal us in ways nothing else can.",

A lot of familiar faces in this film, and Vaughn has the perfect temperament for the lead. Didn't know it was a true story until the ending.",

It\u2019s a feel-good, comforting watch and Vince Vaugh\u2019s portrayal of protagonist Joe brings a relatable everyman quality to has the audience immediately on his side in determination that his venture is successful in honour of his family.",

To each their own, but this was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. I\u2019m all for a cheesy feel good movie any day of the week. But this wasn\u2019t that at all. It also lacked any kind of hard hitting deep sentimental emotional moments either. It felt cheesy in the cringiest way and was slow and painful to watch. \n\nNot once did I laugh, I let out an awkward, sympathy chuckle at one point to gauge whether the people I was watching with were finding it as terrible as I was (I found out about 50 mins in that they were). \n\nSide note- I really like a lot of the actors and actresses in this movie so I was very surprised at how utterly crap I thought the movie was. \n\nLike I said - to each their own, but personally I didn\u2019t enjoy anything about this movie. Had to come on and make this account and write this review to hopefully stop other people having to endure it (as I watched based on all the positive reviews). Not sure if I\u2019ll be trusting reviews ever again after this, I\u2019m shaken and so confused by the good ratings (as was everyone I watched with).",

    "text": "The premise of the movie was exciting but the execution was a disaster. So many missed chances to delve into the lives of New York Italian Nonnas, so much rich culture and history to share with the world, just for it to be a painfully cringe caricature of what white Anglo Saxon Protestants think of Italians and Italian Americans. The Nonnas don\u2019t even speak Italian, the actors pretending to didn\u2019t bother to learn the most basic pronunciation. Imagine watching someone pretend to be from Mexico and say \u201cgray-see-us\u201d instead of gracias? Thats how Antonella sounded saying grazie, the most basic and easy Italian word, and she kept saying it wrong throughout the movie. Anyone who had a Nonna or even remotely knew one would ever be convinced by this movie. Seems like some rich private school girl\u2019s drama class project that daddy paid for and paid the teacher to give her an A. \n\nNext they should make a movie about Miami Cubans but have people from Minnesota write and direct it and Canadians be the actors.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Hay pel\u00edculas que no buscan reinventar nada, sino simplemente ofrecer un rato agradable. Nonnas entra de lleno en esa categor\u00eda, con una propuesta c\u00e1lida, cercana y pensada para disfrutar en familia. Su mayor acierto est\u00e1 en la idea: reunir a varias abuelas italianas alrededor de la cocina para construir una historia de comunidad, nostalgia y afecto.\n\nLa trama se desarrolla sin grandes sobresaltos, pero con un encanto que resulta dif\u00edcil de rechazar. No pretende ser un thriller ni un drama complejo; apuesta por lo cotidiano, por los peque\u00f1os gestos y por un humor ligero que acompa\u00f1a sin restar emoci\u00f3n. En ese sentido, sabe exactamente lo que quiere ofrecer y lo consigue.\n\nEl reparto es otro de sus puntos fuertes. Hay int\u00e9rpretes con carisma y oficio, que se entregan a una historia sencilla pero efectiva. Entre todos logran que los personajes resulten entra\u00f1ables, incluso cuando la pel\u00edcula roza lo cursi o lo previsible.\n\nVisualmente, destaca por la fotograf\u00eda de la comida y los espacios, casi publicitaria, pero efectiva a la hora de trasladar el ambiente hogare\u00f1o. El espectador casi puede oler las recetas que se preparan en pantalla, un detalle que suma a la experiencia y refuerza el tono acogedor.\n\nEn definitiva, Nonnas no aspira a ser m\u00e1s de lo que es: una pel\u00edcula amable, sentimental y agradable de ver. Puede que se quede corta para quienes busquen profundidad, pero para los que quieran pasar un rato entra\u00f1able, tiene los ingredientes justos para dejar buen sabor de boca. Y m\u00e1s a\u00fan, sabiendo que el restaurante existe de verdad.\n\n(ENGLISH) Some films don\u2019t try to reinvent anything; they just want to offer a pleasant time. Nonnas falls squarely into that category, with a warm, down-to-earth proposal meant to be enjoyed with family. Its greatest strength lies in the concept: bringing together several Italian grandmothers around the kitchen to build a story of community, nostalgia, and affection.\n\nThe plot unfolds without major surprises, but with a charm that\u2019s hard to resist. It doesn\u2019t aim to be a thriller or a complex drama; instead, it leans on the everyday, on small gestures, and on light humor that adds to the emotion rather than detracting from it. In that sense, it knows exactly what it wants to deliver\u2014and it succeeds.\n\nThe cast is another highlight. The actors bring charisma and skill, throwing themselves into a story that\u2019s simple but effective. Together they make the characters endearing, even when the film edges toward the sentimental or predictable.\n\nVisually, it stands out for its food and setting photography\u2014almost like an ad, but effective at conveying a homely atmosphere. You can practically smell the recipes being prepared on screen, a detail that enriches the experience and reinforces the cozy tone.\n\nIn the end, Nonnas doesn\u2019t aspire to be more than what it is: a kind, sentimental, and pleasant film. It may feel too light for those looking for depth, but for anyone in search of a heartwarming time, it has the right ingredients to leave a good taste. And even more so, knowing that the restaurant actually exists.",
