    "text": "Nina Dobrev shines in this movie as a comedic actress and honestly, it was so much fun to watch her tackle this genre. People have mentioned a lack of chemistry between the leads where as I felt there was undeniable comparability. While all in all, his actions were deplorable at the beginning, I think just like Hot Frosty, there\u2019s a level of disbelief that has to be suspended as we enjoy the Christmas lightheartedness of it all. Realistically, if this was trying to pass for anything but a sweet Netflix Christmas film, its themes are worthy of criticism. He catfishes her? Forces a fake proposal? Lies to his family only to be greeted with sympathy when she tells the truth? She\u2019s the one who apologises to him by the end for simply trying to get to know the other guy he pretended he was, and then she\u2019s the problem for having been honest? Look it\u2019s all the stuff of nightmares - if this film had been anything other than a lighthearted Christmas movie. And I think it speaks to both actors, and the writers credit, that you do end up smiles beaming for the pair of them by the end anyway. So I say, let it be Christmas and have some fun with this film. It\u2019s geuinely funny, not Netflix try hard funny. It\u2019s warm, well-filmed, Christmasy, and honestly a stand out for Nina. Anyone who knows her from vampire diaries would know her range is impeccable and she deserves way bigger credit in the acting world than she gets - but she really is a likeable lead who manages to be equal parts funny and sympathetic due to her chaotic romantic clumsiness. Maybe I\u2019m basic that this is actualy one of my favourite modern Christmas movies, but I think it manages to strike such a perfect tone with what is essentially a touch concept to tackle in a way that didn\u2019t borderline offend victims of catfishing. I must admit I personally felt them being good friends would have been a more \u2026 appropriate ending. As I felt Natalie suddenly had to - for narrative reasons - be painted as much a fake as Josh with how she pretended her interests for Tag\u2019s sake, and her past dating life was used as a criticism of how she views men, which felt all too convenient when she is at her core a victim of catfishing. But I loved how Josh wasn\u2019t some loser who was socially awkward or geeky, he was intelligent, charming, actually confident to a degree in his wit, and I think he was a one-off example of how societal expectations have wrecked the confidence of young men - and he himself was a rare case where he was all in all an attractive person , just not conventionally, which led him to catfish, so look, it\u2019s not a perfect trope, but for Christmas, pour a glass of wine, enjoy their talents and humour, and love it, actually.",

    "text": "I watch this one every Christmas and it never gets old. It is very easy to watch and enjoy, and it fits perfectly into that spot where you are either easing into the Christmas season or trying to get reminded of it again.\n\nThe comedy hits the right balance. Nothing is overdone and nothing feels undercooked. It is simple, fun, and comfortable. The kind of holiday movie you can put on without thinking too hard and still walk away smiling.\n\nI give it an 8 out of 10 because I like it. Plain and simple.",

    "text": "Love Hard captures the messy beauty of modern romance \u2014 where screens connect hearts as easily as they disguise lies. Natalie, a hopeful writer tired of failed relationships, believes she\u2019s finally found \u201cthe one\u201d in Josh, only to discover she\u2019s been catfished. What begins as deception slowly transforms into an unexpected journey of honesty and vulnerability. Despite its lighthearted tone and festive charm, the film gently reminds us that love isn\u2019t about perfection or appearances, but the courage to be real \u2014 because sometimes, the truest connection comes from the heart, not the picture.\n\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com) and  (English version : uwiepuspita.com)",

    "text": "\"Love Hard\" is the kind of Christmas rom-com that gets under your skin in the best way possible. It's a delightful blend of humor, romance, and a bit of self-aware wit that makes it stand out in the crowded holiday movie landscape. I found the plot engaging, and sweet enough heart to make watch it beginning to end.\n\nJimmy O. Yang and Nina Dobrev bring their characters to life with fantastic chemistry and charm. Yang\u2019s performance as the endearing underdog and Dobrev\u2019s role as the relatable, albeit sometimes insufferable, protagonist kept me hooked from start to finish. Their dynamic is both touching and hilarious, making the inevitable romance feel both earned and authentic.\n\nThe movie also cleverly nods to holiday classics and rom-com tropes, all while maintaining a fresh and modern vibe. From the hilarious Christmas caroling scene to the debate over whether \"Die Hard\" is a Christmas movie, it\u2019s filled with moments resonated with me as a movie fan.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfectly chosen, enhancing the movie\u2019s warm and cozy feel, and the writing balances the comedic and heartfelt moments with finesse.\n\nHowever, it's not without its clich\u00e9s \u2013 there are sassy best friends, stern bosses, and wacky grandparents. But these elements are handled with such a light touch that they feel more like affectionate tributes than tired tropes. The film's ability to poke fun at itself while delivering a genuinely touching love story is what makes it special.\n\nDespite a few predictable moments, \"Love Hard\" manages to be endearing and entertaining, a perfect pick for a cozy night in. Whether you're a die-hard rom-com fan or just looking for a feel-good Christmas movie, \"Love Hard\" is a delightful treat that\u2019s well worth your time.",

    "text": "Dating isn\u2019t easy but online dating is much harder Nina Dobrev plays Natalie, a woman who\u2019s had nothing but bad luck when it comes to dating and relationships with men At the moment she\u2019s turned her messy love life into a successful career writing about how difficult love is Her latest possible match on an app is a guy named Josh She decides to take a risk and meet this man of her dreams all the way in Lake Placid, NY Imagine her surprise when she finds out Josh isn\u2019t real and she\u2019s been cat fished by a guy named Josh who\u2019s really shut in, closed off, and has no confidence Yet in another surprise twist Natalie finds the man who looks like the profile Josh created and now she needs this fake Josh\u2019a help to win his affection The film is bright, colorful, cheerful, very funny, and Dobrev and Yang are a dime a dozen together A lovely soundtrack to go with as well When it comes to love or dating we have to show the real us, we can show our strengths and passions, authentic ness is better than pretending, hiding behind a computer screen/phone doesn\u2019t allow us to really be ourselves, you\u2019re still you despite the insecurities, slight exaggerations are okay but it can lead to disappointment and heartbreak, love has to be honest not perfect It\u2019s not your typical Christmas rom com as its way more foul mouthed It\u2019s also produced by McG of all things and the two leads don\u2019t really have their romance that focused on 100% but director Hernan Jimenez does a pretty solid job with this one constructing its own charm It shows that even two people that aren\u2019t perfect can make their own imperfections work, instead of finding our happy ending we can find our happy beginnings",
