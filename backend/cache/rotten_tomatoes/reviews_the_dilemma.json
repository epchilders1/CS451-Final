If you find yourself constantly offended by things other people say, then find something else. If you're a normal human being looking for a fun entertaining movie it's not bad, give it a watch.",

    "text": "Well it's the better one of the Kevin James 2011 movies. But that's not saying much. The acting is alright. It starts out kind of promising but he longer it goes the more the dialouge just weighs and the humor is somwhere between flat and terribly unfunny. It's dumb, not well set up, repetitive, and just falls flat. James isn't bad and probably the best thing acting wise. Vaughn starts out good but the longer it goes the more unfunny, unlikeable, and dumb his character gets. Connelly I honestly wonder what the point of having her here as I struggle to find a reason for her to be here. And what a waste for Ryder. If the humor was better and a better script this may work because I struggle to see how you can't make something passable with this all star cast but here we are. Everything else is subpar. The direction is pretty basic despite lots of production value. The fact this is Ron Howard is just mind boggling also. There are some dumb and unfunny scenes that just fall flat like the home invasion and the intervention climax. Than it can't decide how to take all it's subplots and make them work together. Vaughn with Connelly, the Dodge car project, and the actual \"Dilemma\" all feels seperate and never works well together. The actual affair too feels low stakes and bounces around between everyone and we go in circles. Maybe it would be worth it if it were actually funny but it's not. It coud've been a lot worse but as it is, it's a unfunny romcom that should be skipped. What a waste of talent in front and behind the camera.",

    "text": "The Dilemma was marketed as a comedy, but it\u2019s really a dark meditation on loyalty, gaslighting, and emotional isolation\u2014wrapped in a comedy shell. One thing stands out: Vince Vaughn\u2019s performance as Ronny, a gem in a morally murky world.\n\nRonny is the emotional center of the film\u2014a man who discovers his best friend\u2019s wife is having an affair and wrestles with whether or not to reveal the truth. But instead of finding support or understanding, he\u2019s met with gaslighting, suspicion, and cold detachment. His journey feels less like a comedic romp and more like a psychological spiral\u2014one that\u2019s all the more painful because he cares. He\u2019s not perfect, but he\u2019s trying to do right by people who would rather maintain the illusion of normalcy.\n\nWhat\u2019s most unsettling is how alone Ronny is. Geneva (Winona Ryder) manipulates and deflects. Ryder could have easily leaned into caricature\u2014the cold, unfaithful partner trope\u2014but she doesn\u2019t. Her performance is calculated, restrained, and deeply human in its denial. Nick (Kevin James) is so disconnected he can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening around him. And Beth (Jennifer Connelly), instead of offering comfort, stages an intervention that feels more like betrayal than concern. The fact that Ronny proposes to her afterward is a haunting moment\u2014perhaps a grasp at stability in a world that keeps pulling the rug out from under him.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment when the film reveals Nick has been secretly visiting massage parlors. The plot leaves it hanging, but that choice feels intentional. The story isn\u2019t about Nick\u2019s morality or Geneva\u2019s. It\u2019s Ronny\u2019s arc\u2014and that detail, left hanging, strips away the illusion that Nick is just a victim. It shows that Ronny is surrounded by people who are just as flawed but unwilling to face it. The truth is messy, and Ronny is the only one brave enough to look it in the eye.\n\nThere are moments of real laughter\u2014the absurdity of Ronny\u2019s physical comedy in one scene involving a greenhouse, Queen Latifah\u2019s blunt delivery, and the tension-release timing in a few scenes with Zip. But the humor doesn\u2019t soften the tragedy; it masks it. It creates a false sense of levity that mirrors how the characters avoid what\u2019s real. This isn\u2019t tonal inconsistency\u2014it\u2019s emotional layering. The comedy works like a pressure valve, letting out just enough steam to keep Ronny\u2019s unraveling from boiling over\u2014until it inevitably does.\n\nWhat makes the film quietly devastating is not just that Ronny is hurt\u2014it\u2019s that he chooses to stay. In a relationship where he\u2019s doubted. In a friendship that doesn\u2019t meet him with the same loyalty. In a world that makes him feel like the problem for trying to protect people who don\u2019t want the truth. That choice\u2014that stillness\u2014is the most haunting part of all.\n\nThe Dilemma may not be the film audiences expected, but for those willing to look past the comedic framing, it reveals something much more honest\u2014and quietly crushing. Vaughn\u2019s performance is subtle, raw, and full of restraint, anchoring the film\u2019s emotional weight. It\u2019s not flashy, but it lingers. And that\u2019s what makes it worth watching.",

    "text": "Ronny and Nick have been best friends since college. The two are partners in their own auto design firm; their big dream comes true when they land a big deal with Chrysler. Nick has found a way to make an electric car sound and feel like a muscle car. Ronny's life has now turned for the worst when he catches Nick's wife cheating with another man. So does he tell his best friend about the other man, or should he wait until the Chrysler presentation is over. Vince Vaughn's character over shot itself. It was just too much Vince. Jennifer Connelly gorgeous as usual. You caught your best friend's wife cheating, but to stretch this topic for a movie for a 1 hr. 58 min was just way too long. Not enough funny parts to compensate for the boring slow pace of the film. Constant yada yada's. Not one of Ron Howard's best films. Soft 3 stars out of 5",

    "text": "This movie was a true disappointment. I like all of the actors, and I thought they would have incredible chemistry, and that there was sure to be some great humor and feeling. But it was about a friend who needed to mind his own business, but he didn't, with tragic results. He spent the whole movie sticking his nose where it didn't belong. The whole movie was a downer until the end when Kevin James shot a puck into a tiny goal at an NHL game and won a trip to \"the Carolinas\" and tickets for the next game. The celebration was so overwhelming. It went on and on and on, slo-mo and ad infinitum. Just for two airline tickets and game tickets that they could have easily paid for themselves. It was an endless celebration by the audience Kevin and Vince for winning balloons. The movie wanted us to think all of the tragedy up to that point was neutralized by the big hyper-irritating way overplayed win.",

Vaughn plays a character we have seen from him many times, and it never gets old.  The premise is interesting- two friends and partners have a huge opportunity to make a life changing deal in the automotive business that is, potentially, threatened by one of their wives' infidelity.   The components are good and some moments are very worthwhile, but the total execution is disappointing.",
