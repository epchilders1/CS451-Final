    "text": "This could have been a cute rom com even tho the stories been done a million times but Sheilds really let the part down. She couldn't convey her character well. Plus, her eyebrows are so harsh, I was distracted looking at them the entire movie! The role between mother n daughter wasn't sorted well either. The daughter was really unfair mom n we had no idea why? Or the mother of a bride telling her daughter she's marrying son of Satan before her wedding becauseof a relationshipshe had 30 years ago? What was that? Cameron Diaz or Julia Roberts woulda put this on a better journey. Daughter looked super young too which is fine but her outfits like a 16yo didnt help. Needs alot of help in this movie from writing to read actors to story telling. Pass.",

The father is insuferable to watch and the mother is gaslit by every other character into thinking she is wrong in an hour and a half of plot driven and manufactured conflict all resolved in less than half a minute of talking.",

That\u2019s not enough to elevate \u201cMother of the Bride\u201d beyond the typical romantic comedy expectations, but it is still good to see her on screen in play out of its second chance trope between the separately single parents of a young couple being wed in Thailand (cue some beautiful scenery at least).",

    "text": "Mother of the Bride starts off with an interesting premise, where the bride\u2019s mother finds out that her daughter is marrying the son of her ex-boyfriend. However, it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere after that. There are also a bunch of side stories that don\u2019t really go anywhere and side characters that mostly stand on the sidelines. Brooke Shields, Benjamin Bratt, and Rachael Harris are good actors, but they\u2019re not given much opportunity to show it off in this bland vanilla rom-com. While I didn\u2019t hate Mother of the Bride, I don\u2019t think that I would choose to walk down the aisle with this movie again.",

    "text": "I know this movie doesn\u2019t have the best reviews, but I liked it. It reminded me of a Hallmark movie. Predictable? Yes. Acting? Ok, but not fantastic. Does it require you to suspend your idea of reality? Yeah, probably. But it was sweet and charming with some good mother/daughter moments which I am a sucker for and a happy ending that is tied up neatly with a bow. If you like low-stress, PG but charming rom-coms, you would enjoy this movie.",
