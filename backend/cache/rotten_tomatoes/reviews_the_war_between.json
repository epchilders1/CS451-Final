    "text": "I recommend The War Between to everyone who is reading this review. The film is beautifully directed by Deborah Correa and the cinematography by Evan Jake Cohen is impeccably gorgeous. This Civil War historical drama set in Arizona in the year 1862, draws you in from the moment the film begins. Damian Conrad-Davis, Sam Bullington, Essa O\u2019Shea and Wayne Charles Baker captivate you with their talent! The War Between was made for the big screen with the vast and breathtaking Arizona landscapes. It is a piece of independent cinema that you have not seen before!",
