    "text": "The Weekend Away is a horrible movie. It had a horrible development, its viewers are constantly led in circles, the characters are dullard and vacuous, and there is no reverence for many things, including marriage. This movie rushed its viewers and didn\u2019t consider many details it should have. This movie, overall, is detestable, and personally, I am glad this movie has the low ratings that it has.",

It's just pointless. was there a mystery? Yes. But with the way the plot was developing i found myself least and least interested in it. The ending was just so uninspiring that it seemed like the whole team couldn't just wait until they finish working on this garbage. It was supposed to be Leighton's comeback i guess. well... better luck next time.",

    "text": "With beautiful cinematography of a picturesque coastal holiday resort, lush palm trees , great nightlife and amazing architecture \u201cThe Weekend Away\u201d works really well as an advertising video for The Croatian Tourist Board. \u00a0However it doesn\u2019t work as well as a murder mystery thriller.\u00a0\n\nBeth ( Leighton Meester ) is invited on a girls weekend by her recently divorced best friend Kate. Beth a new mum to Aster or Esther, pronounced as both throughout, has been rather low due to both the lack of attention from husband Rob and exhaustion due to her baby. Beth \u00a0takes the opportunity to reengage with her friend and have some quality me time away.\u00a0\n\nWhat transpires is a wild night out that descends into a drunken drug filled evening ending up with Kate dead in the water. Now accused of Kate\u2019s murder, Beth takes it into her own hands, with help from a taxi driver, to discover what really happened.\u00a0\n\nIt struck me that given Beth\u2019s actions of how she recklessly destroyed evidence and nearly killed someone before actually doing so, \u00a0that I would also accuse her of her friends murder. Even the handy way Beth finds crucial evidence also suspiciously points the finger of guilt towards her. Beth being the killer would definitely have made for a much better twist than the actual ending.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Weekend Away\u201d seems like a standard, but rather well made, feature length episode of a \u00a0long running TV whodunnit series. \u201cThe Weekend Away\u201d keeps the audience guessing as \u00a0most of the characters that Beth engages with are very suspicious \u00a0and seemingly have some sort of motive to kill Kate. It\u2019s also rather too convenient how crucial evidence is found and how easy it is to kill someone and walk away without any manslaughter charges. Great cinematography though.",

    "text": "As Lifetime movies go, The Weekend Away is a Friday or Saturday entry. Like a Sudoku puzzle, it's a little tougher, a little grittier and takes longer to solve on Fridays and Saturdays.\nAnother thing about Lifetime movies and Sudoku puzzles. They offer the same nine numbers and you just have to put them on the grid correctly to get the solution.\n\nConfused? That's the purpose of a movie like The Weekend Away. It throws what, maybe nine potential suspects at you and tells you to figure it out. The clues are barely meaningful and leads that do have some teeth are soon trumped by some other factoid that just appears out of the blue.\n\nThe Weekend Away should not ever be spent in Croatia, mind you.\nAlthough the scenery is one of the positive points in the film, it is heavily outweighed by a bad story with third-rate actors -- even the ones at the top of the bill -- playing characters you will have little interest in following through to the end.",

The lead character is weirdly shady but so trusting and the people she meets , that's not how normally the world works? And its absolutely crazy that she never noticed her husbands violent behavior before the end. There is little logic to the movie but it wasn't an absolute waste of time. \nIf it was darker it would have been better.",
