This is what happens in Leo. It\u2019s also pretty rough when you\u2019re in 5th grade and your moving on to Middle School. I remember when I was going to Middle School, I was a bit nervous, but after a couple of weeks, I got used to it. I\u2019m sure teenagers and adults are gonna remember how it felt like going on to Middle School if they see this movie. Except, there are some adult jokes that seem inappropriate for kids, and I\u2019m not really sure how to feel about all the pop culture references. But it\u2019s still a good movie!",

It truly encourages us to put ourselves in other people's shoes, to find humility and friendship, not just among friends but also among teachers, as it shows us that, like us, they struggle greatly to make their classes the best they can be. A film that blends humor and reflection.\nSaian Popay\u00e1n",

    "text": "We originally watched this because it was only marketed as a family and comedy movie, and we wanted to watch something with our 9 year old sister. And it was, but my 50 year old mom, 15 year old sister, the 9 year old sister, and me(19 year old lad) thought it was absolutely hilarious. We all laughed so hard throughout the whole movie. The attention to detail in this movie was phenomenal and it really was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. There were a few scenes and dialogue that were a little questionable in a kids movie, but it really was pretty clean and family friendly. Would definitely watch again.",
