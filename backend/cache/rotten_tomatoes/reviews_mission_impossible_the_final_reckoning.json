But you also know that they are going to find a way out of it. Yet despite the predictability I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. (68%)",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" (2025) is the latest and according to creators the last Mission Impossible movie. Well at least for now - in my opinion. If this movie did well as lets say \"Maverik\" at the box office, there wouldn't be any Final mission yet, that is for sure. \n\nI wasn't the biggest fan of previous movie, and therefore i haven't had big hopes for this one. After seeing it i can say that I liked it, but not loved it. It features some of the most impressive action set pieces in this franchise - the U-boat sequence was pretty incredible. Reminded me of \"The Abyss\" a bit. But the problem with this movie as well as with the previous one if the story overall. It is just way to big and sometimes convoluted - like every single live on earth now depends of Ethan Hunt, it was just to much for me. I liked when conflicts were on a smaller scale like in first movies - the Armageddon scenario didn't work for me. The length of this movie is also a bit of a problem. To tell this story run time 2 h 40 min shouldn't have been this bloated. It does dragg, but less than i expected it to drag. \n\nOverall,  \"The Final Reckoning\" is a descent movie at the end of the day, a pretty good one actually considering the craftsmanship, stunts and sets - this is a big movie which unfortunately stumbled on its bloated premise.",

The film manages to keep you interested although it\u2019s never as great as its last to predecessors. Still, for Mission Impossible fans and those who appreciate good action and acting, I recommend it.",

    "text": "A worthy end to this franchise. The two main stunts in the movie are breathtaking and suspenseful, and there is an effective sense of dread that looms of the story. The writing can be a bit cheesy though, but often in an entertaining way; they keep saying 'it is written' whenever anything happens. A lot of the dialogue is exposition, which drags the film down a bit.",

Disappointing end to the series for sure...but WAIT they've left it open to extension yet again! Thanks for a lackluster BORING movie, I literally fastforward watched big chunks of it bc it was dragging so much. Let MI die the painful death this movie created, too bad the first few were so good. Oh and Tom? You're 63, not 25, your naked torso isn't doesn't need to grace the screen anymore, just accept it for goodness sake.",

A trajet\u00f3ria de Ethan Hunt, que come\u00e7ou como um conciso suspense de espionagem, atingiu propor\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9picas, e esse filme nos mostra isso em todos os aspectos. \"Miss\u00e3o: Imposs\u00edvel - O Acerto Final\" parece mais uma jornada epopeica do que um simples filme de a\u00e7\u00e3o e espionagem. A trama faz interessantes e inesperadas conex\u00f5es narrativas com os primeiros filmes da saga, tornando o seu universo muito mais cr\u00edvel e complexo, ao mesmo tempo que utiliza o pertinente impacto da intelig\u00eancia artificial \u00e0 nossa atual realidade para trazer \u00e0 vida o mais desafiador, intimidador e assustador vil\u00e3o que Hunt j\u00e1 enfrentou. \u00c9 o meu filme preferido da saga? N\u00e3o, o meu preferido segue sendo \"Miss\u00e3o: Imposs\u00edvel - Na\u00e7\u00e3o Secreta\" (2015). Ainda assim, essa \u00e9 uma excelente conclus\u00e3o de uma das melhores sagas de a\u00e7\u00e3o do cinema. Isso significa que essa \u00e9 a \u00faltima vez que eu quero ver Ethan Hunt? N\u00e3o, eu adoraria v\u00ea-lo novamente. Mas se esse for o \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo da saga dele, considere-me perfeitamente satisfeito.",
