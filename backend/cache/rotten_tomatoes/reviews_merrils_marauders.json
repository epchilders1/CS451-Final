    "text": "a band of soldiers (forerunners of today's rangers) must move through enemy territory and secure important points to stop the japanese advance in WW 2.\n\nsomewhere in the 70s, and especially the 80s, war movies became much more \"realistic\" and explored combat more from the subjective psychological perspective. this film however is from the old school - objective, black and white, flag-waving, for love of country and honor old school. as such it works, but i could imagine a much more powerful remake of this film - and surely this is a tale worth retelling.",

    "text": "Os filmes de Samuel Fuller n\u00c3\u00a3o precisam de muito tempo para me conquistar: \"Merril's Marauders\" \u00c3 (C) um filme de guerra para homens de barba rija e, nos primeiros 25 minutos, j\u00c3\u00a1 despachou duas sequ\u00c3\u00aancias de batalha capazes de rivalizar com o melhor que se fez no g\u00c3 (C)nero. O mestre n\u00c3\u00a3o perde tempo e obt\u00c3 (C)m sempre a intensidade e o drama que quer. Tirando partido dos previl\u00c3 (C)gios oferecidos pela produ\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o em grande da Warner Bros., \"Merril's Marauders\" conta a hist\u00c3\u00b3ria de um batalh\u00c3\u00a3o de bravos que avan\u00c3\u00a7a pela Birm\u00c3\u00a2nia, contra tudo e contra todos, para impedir as tropas japonesas de se unirem \u00c3\u00a0s alem\u00c3\u00a3s, na Segunda Guerra Mundial. Talvez tamb\u00c3 (C)m porque se trata de um filme da Warner, as mortes dos soldados americanos s\u00c3\u00a3o sempre mais dignas que as dos japoneses. Nada que impe\u00c3\u00a7a Samuel Fuller de fazer um filme claramente patri\u00c3\u00b3tico, mas sempre sofisticado e muito mais complexo do que possa parecer na sinopse. Vale a pena ver nem que seja para observar uns quantos paralelos interessantes com \"A Barreira Invis\u00c3\u00advel\". Ainda n\u00c3\u00a3o \u00c3 (C) desta que vejo um Samuel Fuller que seja pior que \"muito bom\".",

    "text": "Not a bad film at all, although being a Hollywood product it concentrates on the efforts of General Stillwell's Americans rather than General Wingate's British Commonwealth & Empire troops who actually did most of the fighting against the Japanese in Burma. Ty Hardin looked eerily familiiar - sort of a bit like a cross between Jeffery Hunter & Clint Eastwood. Turns out he also played Major Reno in Custer of the West (which is the last film I mistook him for Jeffery Hunter in) and where I'd seen him. Apparently he turned down the Clint Eastwood role in A Fistful of Dollars (fool)!",

    "text": "MERRILLS MARAUDERS qualifies as a testament to the tenacity and the strength of America's fighting men and a story as heroic as anything that ever came out of ancient Greece with its tales of legendary heroes. These flesh & blood heroes here sweated out the worst that the Japanese could deliver and triumphed over incredible odds. Indeed, these G.I.s were often outnumbered and outgunned but they won in the end.The themes of man versus nature, man versus man, and the toll that leadership takes on the individual are examined without sentiment.  The U.S. Army invades Burma in World War II with iron-haired Jeff Chandler in the lead, followed by a strapping young Ty Hardin,Will Hutchins, Peter Brown, and Claude Akins.  The historical epic depicts the extraordinary efforts of the the 5307th Composite Unit to do what nobody else could do or did to prevent the Japanese Imperial Army from linking up with the German Army.  Typically, during World War II movies of the 1960s, the enemy--the Japanese here--were never shown close-up, but instead were only shown in long shots because they were our allies in 1962.  THE STEEL BAYONET director Sam Fuller, who later helmed THE BIG RED ONE, shows the grueling ordeal that 3000 volunteers went through slogging through jungles, wading through swamps, and climbing mountains. If the physical obstacles that these men conquered were not arduous enough, they also had to deal with cerebral malaria, amoebic dysentery, and/or scrub typhus. Promoted by Merrill from the rank of sergeant to lieutenant, Stockton (Ty Hardin of PT-109) hates writing leaders to the families of fallen ones as well as asking his troops to perform the impossible. Brigadier General Frank Merrill (Jeff Chandler) collapses urging his men to put one foot in front of the other to complete their mission.  Fuller does not treat combat as a game of heroes, and our heroes--though brave and gallant--are a weary, run-down bunch of men.  Only 100 survived this trek through Hades to defeat the Japanese.  John Hoyt makes a convincing General Stillwell.  Andrew Duggan plays the doctor who cannot believe that the troops can still fight.  One officer tells Merrill that he plans to have six kids after the war, line them up against a wall and tell them how tough Burma was and then beat the tar out of them if they do not cry.  Sadly, MERRILLS MARAUDERS was the last movie that Jeff Chandler made in a career cut short.  Milton Sperling of BATTLE OF THE BULGE co-scripted this opus with director Fuller from the 1956 non-fiction book by Charlton Ogburn Jr., entitled THE MARAUDERS. Interestingly, Ogburn served as a communications officer for the marauders. This Warner Brothers film was lensed on location in the Philippines,",
