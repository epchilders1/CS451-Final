    "text": "Besides the massive plot holes that come with it, Lucy is an entertaining movie. I like the premise, even though it doesn\u2019t really make sense if you think about it but oh well. The action scenes are great and the CGI is surprisingly good. One thing I couldn\u2019t rap my head around however is why on earth does Lucy not save the people who are getting shot/dying in the film? She has all these reality bending powers yet never saves anyone, nor does she permanently restrain the mobsters who are clearly out to kill her and anyone that stands in their way\u2026 It just felt weird to me. Otherwise this was really entertaining. I assume this whole idea of \"using 100% of our brains\" wouldn\u2019t give us all these god-like powers in real life but I guess it\u2019s fun to think about.",

Always buildup of tension, kept me hooked.\n\n\nWhat i found meh...:\n1. The storyline. At first, it begins by saying that humans always create an origin story centered on their own. Then, it ends by showing how humanity can smh control others and gravity and travel back time and break all the laws of physics by... activating more neurones. Isnt this the most self-centered thing ever. \"We were born with Type 7 civilisation esque potential and we just need to activate it! :))))\"\n\n2. Plotholes. I dont understand. Lucy was dying because she ingested the drug and her cells chose immortality or smth. Then at the end of movie after ingesting so much of the drug, she transcends into the Internet and becomes immortal that way. Umm, someone please explain how this works?",

You will hear criticisms of how this is pseudo-science and there are plot holes, etc. and all those critics are right. What they don't realize is the potential of this movie as to how humankind can evolve.\nIs it weird? Yes. Does it have a weird ending? Yes. But the potential for humanity is expressed as I've never seen it expressed before.",

Siento que es de esas narrativas que una vez que la terminas de ver quedas con m\u00e1s preguntas que respuestas, ya que esta aborda un sinf\u00edn de alegor\u00edas al avance y significado humano, a la vez que tambi\u00e9n es una cinta de acci\u00f3n con algunas de las secuencias m\u00e1s refinadas en este genero que he visto, la escena del hospital y de la persecuci\u00f3n son visualmente espectaculares.\n\nAlgo que me gusta del cine franc\u00e9s es c\u00f3mo mantienen su est\u00e9tica a\u00fan para sus producciones m\u00e1s comerciales, una paleta de colores con tonos \u00e1cidos a la vez que callejeros y deslavados, que contrastan con entornos de suma opulencia, planos subjetivos e inc\u00f3modos hacia los personajes, pero tambi\u00e9n contrastados con planos abiertos m\u00e1s tradicionales, que esta pel\u00edcula toma en las secuencias de acci\u00f3n, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del hermoso retrato que esta hizo de la \u00e9poca en la que fue creada, cada aspecto t\u00e9cnico rebosa en personalidad. \n\nAl final en completa sinceridad, casi no entend\u00ed ning\u00fan de los temas m\u00e1s metaf\u00f3ricos que toca esta pel\u00edcula, pero lo que am\u00e9 de esta es que no necesitas entenderlos para dejarte fascinar por esta pel\u00edcula, porque en su exterior es tan propositiva e interesante para hacerte deslumbrar con sus visuales al igual que con alguna interpretaci\u00f3n que logres atrapar o con cada di\u00e1logo lleno de sustancia que suelta Morgan Freeman. \n\nYo soy de los que piensan que una gran historia en el cine no se puede abordar en hora y media, ya que esta duraci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s un est\u00e1ndar para narrativas m\u00e1s banales como comedia o acci\u00f3n, pero en Lucy cada segundo es oro, no hay ni una escena de relleno o intrascendente, cada di\u00e1logo exterioriza y le da m\u00e1s capas a un ensayo que en toda su duraci\u00f3n nunca deja de ser interesante o propositivo, esta pel\u00edcula es un viaje en acido del cual nunca quieres despertar, y es confusamente hermoso.",

The setup is not bad, and then it just turns into a double-whammy of the worst pseudoscience and the most gawdawful CGI, creating an unpleasant laughable wankfest of ego and wannabe revelation. Not sure how Scarlett Johansson got roped into this, but she should fire her agent.",

    "text": "This was, unironically, one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched. I loved the theory, the beginning, the ending, the characters, the script\u2014I loved it all. Most people hated the ending, finding it silly that she just disappeared, but she didn\u2019t\u2014she became. She was always everywhere; she is time and space; she simply is. The theory that time is the only proof of our existence is technically correct if you think about it, and the idea that we only use 10% of our brain\u2019s capacity makes a lot of sense. It explains why we can\u2019t control our cells, dopamine, or choose the languages we want to know, etc. However, if we accessed over 40%, I believe we would dangerously gain control over others. But what most people wouldn\u2019t understand is that if you had the knowledge, peace, and equal power, there would be no reason for overtaking or fighting. The higher percentage is beyond what we can process because we have never known equality. We have never fully understood ourselves or others. We have never seen time or felt the CO2 between everyone around us. We can\u2019t feel, and yet that\u2019s all we do. We are such emotional beings, worried about the future, our appearance, everything. If we were at the wise percentage, like in Lucy\u2019s story, we could be the future. We could shapeshift and bend our DNA to our will. But Lucy chose not to, because she knew if she remained physical, there would be hatred and aggression toward the powerful peace. So she chose to simply be.",

It is so freaking good and I don't understand how anyone could give it less than a full five stars. It ranks with the very best of sci-fi Action flicks of all time in my opinion. And I see a lot of movies. Once upon a time when DVDs were the Mainstay media, I had over $30,000 invested in DVDs, I'm saying this so you know I am not a lightweight when it comes to movies. In my very young days I went belong to a famous actors organization. It was just brief because I had a very going career at the same time when I dabbled. For those of you that haven't watched this, I trust you you're going to get chills throughout and it is one of the best female action hero movies of all time. I always hope there would be a sequel to this, but of course the way it ends I'm not sure how that would work. I just wish many of the action hero movies were up to this level of solid excellent entertainment.",

There are some interesting themes here, although they only get superficial treatment, which is too bad. It crosses the border though from sci-fi to fantasy. Rather than using her knowledge to create technology to get superpowers, Lucy just gets them de facto. Narratively speaking, this doesn't work well.",
