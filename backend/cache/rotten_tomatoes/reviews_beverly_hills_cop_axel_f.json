It's also really cool that they brought back the main characters (although the clear lack of significant amounts of melanin can be cruel to some beings).\n\nI watched it dubbed, for old times' sake, but even with the main voices, I found it somewhat out of the natural tone of yesteryear.",

The father-daughter dynamic you would expect from Axl Foley\u2019s progeny was not there. Billy and Taggert didn't age well at all. Kevin Bacon looks like Gavin Newsome.",

    "text": "Beverly Hills cop 4 reignites that spark of original film, it hinges on nostalgia but underneath all the comedy and flair is a story about a father who\u2019s seeking redemption from his daughter. This is the heart of the film and it\u2019s carefully interwoven into the general plot. The film begins with Axel chasing down bad guys in the downtown streets of Detroit much to the dismay of his colleagues. Once business is settled he leaves for Los Angeles where he reunites with Billy & Taggart to stop a mysterious enemy from killing Jane when her involvement in a criminal case turns ugly. \nThe trio are back kicking ass, it\u2019s great to see their chemistry reignited. The screenwriting is fresh blending the humour, drama and action nicely. Throw in newcomers Joseph Gordon Levitt as a former love interest and Kevin Bacon as a slick, charming antagonist and you\u2019ve got yourself a winner.  Beverley Hills Cop 4 is a simplified effort, it doesn\u2019t add anything new to the series but Eddie Murphy\u2019s return as Axel Foley is comedy gold. He hasn\u2019t missed a step, slipping on those shades like it\u2019s 1984 all over again.",

    "text": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is determined to return to the 1980s era of action films. Since I grew up watching most of these movies in their reruns during the 1990s, I found myself feeling nostalgic for this kind of \u201csimple minded\u201d cinema. Make no mistake, the jokes are high-brow\u2014so much so that some take a minute to sink in, you might find yourself laughing after the fact. And what about Eddie Murphy? Like Jim Carey or Adam Sandler, he\u2019s almost his own genre of performance that it\u2019s hard to compare his seasoned comedic chops to anyone other than Eddie Murphy himself. Which is to say, how does this compare to other Beverly Hills Cop films? Well, it doesn\u2019t quite reach the thrills of the first, but doesn\u2019t seem as stalled out as the third entry. It exists somewhere in-between, and for this reviewer that\u2019s good enough to recommend for the throwback thrills.",
