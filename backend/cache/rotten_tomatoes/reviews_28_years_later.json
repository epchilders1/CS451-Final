    "text": "I liked it, but the whole idea of the infected got lost. They went from being the main villains to basically becoming background characters. I also didn\u2019t like how the movie tried to humanize everything; the other films do that too, but in a more shocking, impactful way. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the \"alpha\" idea either \u2014 it\u2019s a good antagonist, but it shouldn\u2019t be above the regular infected, because that was supposed to be the key difference compared to movies like World War Z. I also didn\u2019t like (and this is more personal) the childbirth scene; I honestly don\u2019t think it was necessary. As for the humanization, the previous films were much more brutal. I just hope the next ones are good.",

What a load of garbage! \n\nWe were so excited to watch this after a rerun of the first two and what a disappointment. It\u2019s a film that doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. \nStarted out okay but it\u2019s like the writers somehow managed to get themselves infected and trolled everyone into parting with their cash!

What was Ralph Fiennes thinking? And Jodie Comer!?\n\nThe editing is like a bad pop video. The score just doesn't work, but I was ready to forgive the creative licence. Then... it was OK, up to the point a zombie had a baby. Then, it decends into comedic farce. Awful.",

    "text": "28 Years Later\u00a0is as a thrilling and worthy continuation of the franchise, with the original creative team returning to deliver a darker, more evolved take on the rage virus. I like the fresh setting of isolated settlers, the father\u2011son dynamic between Aaron Taylor\u2011Johnson and Spike, and the emotional stakes of Spike\u2019s journey, which add heart to the horror. The film introduces new classes of rage zombies\u2014regular, alpha, and bottom feeders\u2014bringing variety and tension, while Ralph Fiennes\u2019 doctor role expands the lore. With intense violence, gripping atmosphere, and strong character work, I found it both scary and heartfelt,\u00a0 it's possibly my favorite of the series despite a strange ending that sets up future sequels.",

I went with a friend, so I was hesitant to walk out and watched the whole thing.\n\nHis first two movies were excellent in this franchise. My only guess is that they had AI write the movie, then had AI write a bunch of positive reviews once it was released. What a world we live in.",
