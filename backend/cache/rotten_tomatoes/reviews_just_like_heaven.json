It's a well paced film at around 90 minutes, there are some decently amusing scenes in there alongside some more sombre ones - the majority of which come off rather well. Some parts are clich\u00e9, but not to the degree that it affected my enjoyment.\n\nOne that is well worth a watch, in my opinion of course.",

This feels like someone lost a bet, while the film offer brilliant sequences such as stealing a body, kids who have ghost tea parties, the perfect coach and driving a mini van stunt wise. Uhh this is bad in every way and perfectly stupid to watch again.",
