Kiana Madeira, Ashley Zukerman, Gillian Jacobs, Benjamin Flores Jr., Mike Winfield, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. The plot of the movie was intense and thrilling. It's about how it all started and who is responsible. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime, but watch the first two movies before this one. It'll explain everything and blow your mind.",
