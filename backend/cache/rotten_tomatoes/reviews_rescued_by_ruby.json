Like Ruby and Bear, Sasha was a rescue, and became my companion for 12 years. Like Ruby and Bear there was a lot of work needed.\n\nFor those thinking of getting a dog, watch this film. There is no such thing as an untrainable dog, if you are willing to give them time and get to know who they are. Rescue dogs often carry past traumas that you'll need to work through, but once you learn who they are, and build that bond, you'll never have a more loving, faithful and dedicated partner.",

I had facepalm moments through the movie thinking how idiotic must someone be to do such things, and how everything seems like it\u2019s blatantly engineered to fit the underlying story. An awesome story wasted.",

Starring Grant Gustin, the film captures the emotional journey of both human and animal, with a focus on perseverance, loyalty, and second chances. While it follows a predictable formula, its sincerity, warm performances, and feel-good moments make it an enjoyable and inspiring watch.",

Not only did they not get a Rhode Island accent (which by the way is closer to the Bronx than it is to Somerville) they didn\u2019t get it in New England.  The. movie would have been so much better if they had just ignored the accent and let the scenary place it in Rhode Island.",

There are very very very few good \u201cdog\u201d movies and unfortunately this one isn\u2019t good either. It was like a Hallmark melodrama. The true story is an amazing story to tell but it could have been told much better. Bear who plays Ruby is delightful and he is beautiful to watch. I was disappointed by the movie and mislead by all the hoopla and acolytes given to it.",

No es una pel\u00edcula que pretenda ser m\u00e1s de lo que es, con una trama l\u00ednea y con un desarrollo narrativo circular, personajes carism\u00e1ticos y emp\u00e1ticos dentro de una trama de superaci\u00f3n basada en hechos reales que funciona; Argumentalmente sustancial y cinematogr\u00e1ficamente correcta.",
