Although they did miss the chance to broaden the movie by having the mother inlaw have a more indepth story line. She could of meet someone at the community center or discuss her past more. To bad its on Tubi only and not available to more streaming services. Plus I was waiting for the Uncle to come out of the closet.",

    "text": "This movie showcases an amazing collection of actors, and the interwoven story lines combine to create an entertaining and heartfelt film. This is essentially the Avengers of Asian romance/comedy actors, featuring all-stars like Ross Butler, Lana Condor, and Andrew Koji, as well as up-and-coming stars like Ali Fumiko Whitney and Ricky He. I particularly loved Ali Fumiko Whitney\u2019s portrayal, having seen her in several films this year (#AMFAD: All My Friends Are Dead / Find Me Falling), this girl has RANGE! Add this film to your must-watch list. Great to see a new platform like Tubi dive into original content.",

    "text": "This movie starts out a little differently than most movies. It quickly introduces the characters and it seemed intriguing. The dialogue was quirky and enjoyable. \nSpoiler: As the father of three, and a grandfather I was upset by the birthing scene, that with no foreshadowing turned into a stillborn.  I don\u2019t like the latest trend of calling something a comedy, that has horrible tragedies in it. I am seeking entertainment not depression. \nI didn\u2019t watch the rest of the movie, it might be great, but I am bailing.",

    "text": "\u201cWorth the Wait\u201d is a charming, feel-good romcom that delivers both heart and humor.\n\nThe writing is clever, and I loved how the film juggled multiple storylines while still giving each character emotional depth. The ensemble cast really brought it\u2014every actor made the most of their role.\n\nKnowing the stories were inspired by the creators\u2019 real-life experiences adds an extra layer of sincerity and makes the film\u2019s message hit even harder.\n\nMy only critique is that the multiple narratives sometimes made the film feel a bit drawn out. That said, trimming it down might have compromised the emotional investment we feel for each character.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a culturally specific yet universal take on love, loss, and connection\u2014and definitely worth the watch.",

    "text": "\"2025,\" featuring Ross Butler, initially seemed promising with its intriguing cast and the potential for a fresh, cultural perspective. It appeared to offer something unique and engaging.\n\nHowever, the film's storyline quickly revealed itself to be a rehash of well-worn tropes that audiences have seen countless times in recent years, lacking any hint of originality or creativity.\n\nDespite the impressive cast, the execution fell flat. I struggled to feel any genuine connection among the characters; it felt more like they were simply going through the motions rather than forming authentic bonds. This lack of chemistry, especially in the romantic scenes, made it difficult to invest in their relationships.\n\nOverall, the film felt disappointingly one-dimensional. At times, the dialogue was dull and uninspired, detracting from any potential for a compelling narrative. Ultimately, while it may appeal to some, I personally wouldn\u2019t choose to watch it again.",

The movie had a great script that had us laughing and crying throughout, and the actors brought a depth to their characters uncommonly seen in movies of this genre. It definitely touched on a few more serious themes, but that just made the movie feel more real and the characters more relatable. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably watch it again!",

The writing is especially impressive\u2014it juggles multiple storylines effortlessly, giving each one space to breathe without losing momentum or heart.

I\u2019ll absolutely watch anything this screenwriter creates next.",
