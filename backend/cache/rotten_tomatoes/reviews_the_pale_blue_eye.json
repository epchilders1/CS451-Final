Acting was great and I am rather savvy on figuring out Who-Done-It, but I was totally taken by surprise with A Pale Blue Eye.  A must watch for anyone looking for a good mystery. Two thumbs way up!",

The suspense was maintained throughout the two-hour journey, with plenty of \"whodunit\" moments to keep me intrigued and invested. The film struck the perfect balance of twists and turns, making it an exciting and worthwhile watch without ever feeling predictable. The main cast delivered strong performances, with nothing to disrupt my immersion or distract me from feeling as if I were right alongside Augustus Landor and Edgar Allan Poe, eager to solve the mystery at hand.",

Pero seria un necio si digo que no es otra cosa que un pelicul\u00f3n, tiene una historia atrapante, una hermosa cinematograf\u00eda y unas actuaciones impresionantes. Que no sea lo que habitualmente me gusta ver no quita la calidad que tiene.",

    "text": "A pesar de a primera instancia parecer una circular primicia de un malhumorado detective que busca resolver un asesinato, la misma ambig\u00fcedad del fat\u00eddico acto da pie a un di\u00e1logo sustancial sobre c\u00f3mo nuestra desesperaci\u00f3n e impotencia pueden nublar nuestro juicio hasta hacernos llegar a un punto sin retorno. A diferencia de los cientos de pel\u00edculas originales de Netflix, la \u00fanica palabra con la que puedo definir a esta cinta es personalidad. Una cinematograf\u00eda empa\u00f1ada con un lente azuloso hermoso, que retrata de una grata manera los hermosos paisajes que eligieron para esta cinta c\u00f3mo del fant\u00e1stico dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n en cada locaci\u00f3n. El guion de Scott Cooper cuenta con un ritmo fabuloso que hace que la historia se desenvuelva de una manera en la que no perdamos en inter\u00e9s en seguir el hilo de esta, a pesar de tener un desarrollo muy lento en casi ning\u00fan momento se llega a sentir pesada.\nPero a pesar de su gran planteamiento del conflicto, la misma en ciertas escenas si se llega a sentir un poco lenta, con escenas que pareciera que est\u00e1n con el \u00fanico fin de alargar m\u00e1s la duraci\u00f3n de la cinta; pero a pesar de ello, la gran actuaci\u00f3n de Christian Bale y todo el elenco hacen que hasta las situaciones m\u00e1s rutinarias sea un goce verlas. Y para mi justamente la belleza de la pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 en estas escenas, escenas con una lenta cocci\u00f3n que nos dan m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n tanto del incidente incitador c\u00f3mo del pasado de nuestros personajes. \nYo creo que la mayor pol\u00e9mica de esta pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 en su \u201cplot twist\u201d que posiblemente sea igual de divisorio que otra cinta de Christian Bale c\u00f3mo podr\u00eda ser \u201cThe Prestige\u201d, un giro de trama tan grande que cambia por completo la escaleta narrativa de la cual ya \u00e9ramos c\u00f3mplices. Y para mi es controversial poque dota de una complejidad mayor tanto a los personajes c\u00f3mo a la historia y al conflicto que establecen, pero tambi\u00e9n hay escenas que en una segunda revisi\u00f3n ya no se sienten tan org\u00e1nicas y hasta se podr\u00edan llegar a percibir con huecos argumentales, dado a que la misma narrativa en muchos momentos llega a ser sobre explicativa, haciendo que su misticismo sea poco interesante.\n\nThe Pale Blue Eye es un recordatorio del peligro de cegarnos ante nuestra desesperaci\u00f3n que puede culminar con resultados peores a los actuales que nos estamos enfrentando.",

    "text": "Among the many qualms I had with Pale Blue Eye, two of the largest: lack of scene fluidity and adequate character development - this tiresome red herring of a period murder mystery is well, boring. Gotta get this off my chest first: Robert Duvall's tiny and odd role was almost offensive in its so-obvious \"disguise\" as an expositional tactic to all but explain to the viewer what we would have never deduced on our own. Felt like he was tricked into agreeing to be in this movie.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\n In a perfect world, Bale's Augustus Landor and Melling's fictional (also, WTF?) Edgar Allen Poe would've ~somewhat~ made up for the underdevelopment of every other character and a lackluster twist. But they don't. This was the first film I've watched of Bale's where he is fully asleep at the wheel. I watched with horror at his odd attempts at liveliness. Those dang inflections (re: accusing Doctor whatshisface of blood magic). He looks tired. Like tired of being in this movie perhaps and maybe tired of covering up...(BIG spoiler) his own crimes. Maybe the script was to blame. Maybe it's him, but either way, I could relate to sleepy Bale struggling to finish this movie as I was right there with him. As for cartoon Edgar Allen Poe. Seriously, what gives? Will have to do some research of the book's origin this is based off of and what was the inspiration for having Poe, a real life person, involved in this. Dudley from Harry Potter tries to do his best and I commend his attempt, but damn is it hollow. \n\nThe one-and-half-stars I gave this film were solely for the nostalgia I have for the Hudson Valley setting and a break-taking view of what I believe to be Washburn trail in Cold Spring, NY. In a way, Pale Blue Eye is a shoddy almost Kirkland ripoff of The Prestige with some of Burton's Sleepy Hollow. It does a good job transporting us to 1830s NY, but that's about it.",
