    "text": "I groaned when Taylor Russel's character, one of our two protagonists, first started delivering the dialogue that is meant to tell the audience she was a genius.  It wasn't the only sloppy storytelling technique.  Had the moviemakers taken the time to smooth out the rough spots, ESCAPE ROOM could have become a classic.  The most horrifying part of the story is when we see the influence of puppet masters with too much money on their hands.  What we see in the \"escape room\" might be fiction, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.  Sadism, unchecked wealth, no oversight. . .it's what has brought our world to the abyss.",

    "text": "There are times when the script should change based on what an actor or actress is able to bring to the table. This is one of those times. One of the best characters is removed very early on and it's like when the team you're rooting for in the world series gets cut. It's hard to care for another 45 minutes after that. Another major problem is how the players are being rushed through every room, but they still have time to drag on with extremely boring waiting sequences. The solutions are designed to be way too quick and specific. In all the extremely well designed rooms, there is only one specific and uninteresting way to get through them. That makes 99% of the set entirely useless. Maybe that's good for a real life horror scenario, but not very compelling for a film you want people to watch.",

    "text": "Although entertaining and set at a good pace, the movie failed to deliver any form of actual problem-solving with most of the solutions just being thought of immediately. Also, besides the start of the movie, none of the challenges required any type of puzzles to escape and instead were just survival-based. Despite the characters being somewhat realistic, they were very unlikable and had little to no character development. Overall, if you want to watch an entertaining film based around  mysterious people making survival games, watch Squid Games.",

While the characters were likable and there was plenty of action, the movie didn\u2019t really pull me into the puzzle-solving\u2014it felt like a passive experience, and I was left wondering why this was happening and how these people were chosen. The plot and theme disappointed me, and the ending didn\u2019t satisfy. I\u2019d give it a 2.5 out of 5.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Escape Room arranca con una idea tan simple como atractiva: varios desconocidos atrapados en salas que parecen imposibles de superar. No descubre nada nuevo en el g\u00e9nero, pero consigue enganchar gracias a un ritmo \u00e1gil y a escenarios que, por momentos, sorprenden por su ingenio.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula se disfruta sobre todo en su primera mitad, cuando cada sala se convierte en un nuevo reto lleno de tensi\u00f3n y con detalles que mantienen al espectador pendiente. Ah\u00ed es donde el film funciona como un pasatiempo: \u00e1gil, con sobresaltos bien medidos y lo bastante ingenioso para no aburrir.\n\nEl problema llega cuando el guion intenta ser m\u00e1s ambicioso de lo necesario. Los giros se ven venir de lejos, los personajes resultan demasiado arquet\u00edpicos y la resoluci\u00f3n final no est\u00e1 a la altura de lo que promete. Se percibe cierta obsesi\u00f3n por preparar terreno para una posible secuela, lo que resta fuerza al desenlace.\n\nAun con esas carencias, Escape Room cumple con lo que promete: un thriller de entretenimiento ligero, que se disfruta mientras dura aunque se olvide r\u00e1pido al salir de la sala. Una pel\u00edcula que no pretende m\u00e1s que ofrecer un rato de tensi\u00f3n y, en eso, cumple dignamente.\n\n(ENGLISH) Escape Room starts with an idea as simple as it is appealing: several strangers trapped in rooms that seem impossible to overcome. It doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the genre, but it manages to hook the viewer thanks to a fast pace and settings that, at times, surprise with their ingenuity.\n\nThe film is most enjoyable in its first half, when each room becomes a new challenge full of tension and details that keep the audience engaged. That\u2019s where the movie works best as a pastime: fast, with well-timed scares and clever enough not to bore.\n\nThe problem comes when the script tries to be more ambitious than necessary. The twists are predictable, the characters feel too archetypal, and the final resolution doesn\u2019t live up to what was promised. There\u2019s a clear obsession with laying the groundwork for a possible sequel, which weakens the ending.\n\nEven with those shortcomings, Escape Room delivers on what it promises: a light thriller that entertains while it lasts, even if it\u2019s quickly forgotten once you leave the theater. A film that doesn\u2019t aspire to more than providing a moment of tension, and in that sense, it succeeds.",
