    "text": "Molly and her father are psychopaths and planned this murder, set Jason up. She just wanted the kids, she made up stories about giving birth to them. She brainwashed his children. Molly is delusional and she was raised by a controlling father and a submissive mother. Why is Molly's mother not making any interviews? Why would he bring a bat to calm them down? Why would she have a brick in the bedroom, is that where the children were going to paint it? Why did they not have any injuries? Why beat him so badly that he couldn't defend himself; two on one? Jason was never going to have her have custody, no way!!! Why didn't she get pregnant and have her own child with Jason? I don't believe she can have children, she miscarried one, maybe more than one! Two murderers killed an innocent man, he lost the love of his life and then they took his life from his children!!! Their attorneys are doing their jobs, that why they are called defense attorneys, the justice system in this country is so screwed up, this whole country is screwed up! No surprises here, just another injustice ... I hope the children have happy successful lives, they deserve it!!!",

    "text": "Pretty good. It's in interesting, though horrifying, story without a clear answer. Often documentary makers reach a conclusion then push it hard. This one just lets you consider a lot of evidence on both sides, adding to each side of the scale step by step back and forth, as to where this really was on the spectrum from self defense to premeditated murder. I see other reviewers have strong opinions, but the documentary doesn't push one and that's a big plus. Personally if the retrial had gone to a jury I was on, I'd have voted to acquit: state didn't have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of even manslaughter IMO. OTOH if the Irish family had sued (maybe they did, it wasn't mentioned) for wrongful death I'd have voted Molly, at least, civilly liable. I believe it's likely she acted wrongly and perhaps her father too, just not beyond reasonable doubt. The victim had anger/control issues, evidence of that wasn't refuted IMO by family and friends insisting he was a 'nice guy' or saying the secret recordings were 'taken out of context'.",

    "text": "76%. 7/7/25. Weird set of circumstances with a deranged step-mom and her dad killing her husband. The husband also had a weird background with a somewhat suspicious death to his prior wife and questions around his abuse to this lady. It seemed like he probably was abusive but the wife went too far and killed him. But leaves you with a lot of questions. Feel terrible for the kids. Solid watch, but no reason to rewatch. 2/5 rewatch.",

    "text": "This was a very well-done documentary about a travesty of justice. It's about a lying, (proven by investigators) manipulative woman and her enabling father, who claimed that a very drunk (another lie - Jason was  legally sober enough to drive) jason attacked them and was so wild, the two of them had to beat him to death in self defense. Molly and Tom had not a mark on them, yet Jason was a gruesome mess. There was blood on Jasons' pillow. Had he been sleeping during the first blow? Very likely, in my opinion. I used to be an avid reader of true crime and have watched many trials. I don't remember ever seeing a pair of killers recieve 6 years for what so clearly looked like a pre-meditated slaughter. What has become of our justice system?",

The case itself? Heartbreaking. You can\u2019t help but feel for those poor kids caught in the middle of such a twisted mess. Honestly, their strength shows, and I\u2019m sure their real parents would be beyond proud. As for the stepmom and her creepy dad? Zero remorse, zero humanity... they deserved way more time behind bars. If you're into crime docs and want something that\u2019ll keep you shaking your head, this one's a decent pick.",

However, I came away with the view that no matter how you cut it, Molly Martens and her father look completely culpable. They played dirty and shamelessly lied so many times. And in the end they attacked the characters of everyone in the Corbett family including his kids!",

    "text": "The documentary meticulously details the events surrounding Jayson's death. Both parties were given the opportunity to present their accounts of that day; however, Molly and Tom's narratives contain significant inconsistencies. The crime scene itself raises serious questions, and the physical evidence does not convincingly support the claim of self-defense\u2014the self-defense claim appears excessive. While I'm glad they were both convicted, I'm disappointed the sentences weren't life imprisonment. This is solely my opinion.",
