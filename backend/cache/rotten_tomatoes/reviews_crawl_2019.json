No worries! Helicopters and boats still work just as well. \n\nYou can even retain the flowers on your rose bush. They\u2019re immune! \n\nI watch a movie almost every night and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a movie so bad I\u2019ve considering drinking to drown the sorrow. \n\n-1/10",

    "text": "If you liked this, you'd probably also enjoy another horror movie made by this director called High Tension (2003) or this other natural horror movie called The Shallows (2016).\n\nCrawl (produced by horror legend Sam Raimi) far exceeded my expectations and firmly sits near the top of the list when it comes to \"natural horror\". What really makes this movie work is the combination of a few things...\n\n1. This movie is advertised as a horror, when secretly it's also a natural disaster thriller (like Twister). The characters refuse to drown trapped in the crawlspace under their Florida  home being flooded by a hurricane, therefore they MUST face the threat of alligator attack by traversing through the waters in an attempt to get to higher ground. The audience suffers both fear from the creatures and anxiety from the storm at the same time.\n\n2. The script wastes no time getting down to business. With a runtime of 87 minutes, the protagonist's Dad is declared missing and the hurricane starts 5 minutes in. At 15 minutes in, a tree is hurled through the window of their home and the threat of weather is real. And at 20 minutes in, our two protagonists are pinned down by 2 gators in the flooding crawlspace underneath the house. \n\n3. Almost 60 of the 87 minutes of Crawl takes place in a single location: the crawlspace under the home. This confined space cleverly adds a layer of claustrophobia on top of the fear of drowning and being torn apart by alligators.\n\n4. Most importantly, this creature-horror seems (relatively) realistic, like The Shallows (2016) and is fiercely anchored by strong performances by Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper.",

It could benefit from better camera shots tho. I don't have any more problems, the story was good, the jumpscares were good, the enemies were good, the characters were good, the kills were good, the setting was good... Like literally everything was done as well as it could possibly be!",

    "text": "This simple film is by no means a masterpiece for the ages, but it had a lot of heart, and I enjoyed a lot for what it was. The basic situation is almost guaranteed to provide plenty of suspense, and this element was executed competently. I found myself warming to duo of main characters (or trio if you include the dog), the protagonist and her dad, which made me root for them in their peril. The alligators are suitably brutal, and they facilitate some effective action sequences. Furthermore, the film doesn't outstay its welcome. I have very little to complain about here!",

While the lead character can be a little grating at times and the ending wraps up a bit too cleanly, the film largely succeeds as a lean, mean creature feature that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",

Much of the dialogue is those two yelling the other's name back and forth:  \"HALEY?\"  \"DAD?\"  And of course \"HELP!\" All leading to the bland and ridiculous ending. Hated this film.",

    "text": "Most creature-features both good and bad exaggerate their wild antagonists in an attempt to make things more interesting. Ever since the genre peaked with Jaws, such attempts have since dropped even into hysterical attempts. But that's what's extra scary about Crawl. The things these alligators do, how big they are, how they act - it's very plausible. The gators are portrayed very well. My only note is gators don't need to eat that much but then again when you only eat a few times a year why not go at it? Anyways the story is pretty good, the cast isn't special but their acting is supplemental. Violent, fast paced, lots of suspense.\nHurricane Milton Meets Hurricane Wendy (not the fast-food location).",
