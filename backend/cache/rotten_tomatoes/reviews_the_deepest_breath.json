Alessia gets the world record but then really wants to go to the really challenging underwater cave and that's where everything goes wrong. The way they shoot it is crazy because it seems as though Alessia and Stephen are both dead, until Alessia is finally shown interviewed and you realize Stephen saved her and sacrificed himself. Incredible story.",

    "text": "Endorphin porn, a shallow look through blue tinted lenses at people who know how close they are to touching death with every deeper dive. No matter how beautiful the photography, the locations, the Adrenalin junkies' diving bodies, there is no escaping the fact that free-diving at this level is  dicing with death every time, and the people who organise it are utterly reckless in their failing to provide adequate safety measures for divers. The film fails to address this, just as it fails to cast any meaningful light on the personalities of the \u2018stars' of the film. It's a truly tragic film, a cleverly constructed snuff movie. While viewers won't get the almost two hours of their lives spent watching it back, at least two of the people in the film won't get their lives back at all. Truly sad.",

    "text": "'The Deepest Breath' is part compelling documentary, part thriller, part real life tragedy. But more importantly one of the best films I've ever seen.\n\nSYNOPSIS: 'A champion and expert safety diver seemed destined for one another. Despite different paths taken, they meet at the pinnacle of the free-diving world, experiencing the thrilling rewards and inescapable risks of chasing dreams through the depths of the ocean'.\n\nVisually stunning with incredible photography from the real events shown within the documentary, 'The Deepest Breath' is such an intense movie it will stress you out.\n\nAs someone who has a fear of going under water this film touched on every fear I have and more. I found myself transfixed and glued to every second on screen.\n\nIf you ever wanted an examination of how small humans are compared to the world around us, and especially the underwater world, this is that film.\n\nThis isn't just a story of sportsman and women pushing them to their absolute limits, it's a story of love and the most harrowing of losses. The line of risk vs reward runs deep here and I'd argue that the risk was just not worth it.\n\nI can't express how good this film is. More importantly it touched me and made me feel the loss and pain of those involved within the documentary.\n\nPoignant, moving but terrifying.\n\nIt's just the best. Watch it! \n\n10/10",

    "text": "Part romantic drama and part nature documentary, The Deepest Breath will leave you in tears. While at times disjointed and hard to follow, the film chronicles Italian freediver Alessia Zecchini and her mission to break a world record with the help of safety diver Stephen Keenan. There are some serious questions about this, namly why are people in love so willing to push the envelope. The title says it all, and the filmmaker does an excellent job of setting up what freediving is. Often uncomfortable, it is very hard to believe how long these people hold there breath! While I wanted more about the relationship, it focused more on diving. Exciting and full of energy, but what really works is how well the sea is captured on film. Despite it being repetitive, the final few scenes more than make up for it! Final Score: 7/10",
