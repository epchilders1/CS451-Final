I'm not sure why there are so many scrooges bashing a kids movie, but this gave me a serious sense of nostalgia for silly, entertaining movies from my childhood.\n\nLoved the cast, the friendship between \"Ernest\"and Kevin was adorable. This movie is goofy, and audiences need to be okay with that to enjoy it because it's a blast to watch.",

That's not... huh?\" And that's if you have a solid understanding of what's happening.\nTerrible movie and yet for some stupid reason at the end you'll find your eyes misty.\nWe Have a Ghost is a terrible movie, with solid cast, some good ideas, and a would-be interesting plot, were it not for the cast, the bad ideas, and the uninteresting plot.",

It also had emotional moments and I teared up at the end. It was sweet and I was surprised at how much we were able to connect with the ghost character when he can't even speak. Shows what an amazing actor he is!",

Admito que la disfrute mas de lo que esperaba, grata sorpresa.",

But overall, there were clearly too many directions the writers wanted to go that caused this movie to be way too long and not very good. \n\nThe CIA aspect was so unnecessary, lazy, and took the story down a poorly executed \u201cStranger Things\u201d road. \n\nShould you watch it? If you\u2019re looking for a \u2018family friendly-ish\u2019 movie during the halloween season and you\u2019ve already watched all the classics, sure. But, you\u2019re not missing anything.",

And Kevin brought such sweetness to the role. Did not expect to have such heavy feels from a random Netflix watch - if you like a bit of \"horror\", comedy, but are also a sap like me - give it a shot",

David Harbor's performance was exceptional as Ernest the ghost, even though he doesn't speak. I laughed, I was on the edge of my seat, and I teared up at the end. It's not award-worthy, but I was entertained. The young actors who played Kevin and Joy were particularly impressive. I recommend it!",
