Lilly Collins is a bad as she's always been, Simon Pegg is interesting until the last 10 minutes, when he suddenly drops any sign of range you would have thought he got on this movie. \n\nI saw this movie in a streaming platform in Spain called Filmin and it made me so angry I cancelled my yearly subscription.",

I'm not a of fan of horror movies, preferring ones that have you on the edge of your seat but without a lot of gore and silly apparitions type stuff.",

    "text": "The premise was captivating enough but there were too many strikes to call it a good movie. The lead actress's performance was flat...she was so stern and demanding the entire movie. The plot was extremely implausible. There is no character development, just a long sequence of attempted 'gotcha' moments before the movie ends. And the movie does nothing meaningful with the supporting characters...I questioned why they even existed.",

And, it should be pointed out that, while some of the reviews felt there were descrepencies in the  acting (which I felt was fine), I saw the actual difficulty in the screenplay itself and the direction \u2014 not in anyone's acting at all.",
