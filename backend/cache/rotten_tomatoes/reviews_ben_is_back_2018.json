    "text": "I found the first half of this film quite compelling as we are introduced to the characters involved and become quickly intrigued by Ben's unexpected return home and the varying emotions that his arrival evokes. Roberts and Hedges are compelling and successfully elicit both sympathy and frustration. And then halfway through, the film makes a drastic 180 degree turn that leaves behind the character development and becomes more of a thriller that relies on an increasingly hard to swallow series of events that feel more like screenwriting conceits than true to life drama and strain credibility. That's too bad, because the first part is so strong that I was really rooting for it to continue on a path of greatness. Everyone has their hearts in the right places, but by the end, after one too many coincidences have occurred, you may find yourself rolling your eyes rather than wiping tears from them.",

    "text": "Ben is back but is he really? Lucas Hedges and Julia Roberts co-star as son and mother along with Courtney B. Vance and Kathyrn Newton A teenager Ben Burns returns home just in time for Christmas Eve after being released from rehab His mother Holly is ecstatic about her sons return but tries to hide anything that'll bring back his drug addiction But something comes back to haunt Ben and he has to try and fix it Does Holly really know her son as well as she thinks she does? How much more trouble is he knee deep in? She will do anything just to have him back from before he went away This is a very slow moving drama being more of a character piece There's virtually no music throughout Yet the film really gets by on both Roberts and Hedges' performances My only real problem was the ending; it doesn't really wrap up as it just stops The first half is so much different from the second half that's for sure and this has a more direct to video feel to it Yet both performances are magnetic despite it straining credibility in many parts The actors alone should be viewed for this",

I would have ended it differently but that's just me\n I would prefer to see Ben clean a year later because that's how I want it to be in real life",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Um drama que relata o caso de um drogado que esta lutando para vencer o v\u00edcio. Pena que o filme n\u00e3o mostre ao seu final, se ele vence ou n\u00e3o. At\u00e9 a metade do filme \u00e9 um drama, mostrando o sofrimento de uma m\u00e3e e sua fam\u00edlia em ter um filho drogado, que j\u00e1 foi internado varias vezes. E se o filme continua-se nesta vis\u00e3o, o filme seria muito melhor. Pois a atua\u00e7\u00f5es de Julia Roberts, de sua filha Kathryn foi muito boa. E claro Lucas. Que desde igreja, a grupo de ajuda, velhos amigos e a pr\u00f3prio pr\u00e9-conceito da fam\u00edlia, principalmente do padastro e sua pr\u00f3pria irm\u00e3. E sua m\u00e3e que parece um pitbul que n\u00e3o solta de seu filho em \u00fanico momento. Mas depois do meio para o final o filme se transforma em uma persegui\u00e7\u00e3o da m\u00e3e ao filho que para recuperar o seu cachorro, vai encontrar com antigos amigos. E se torna uma persegui\u00e7\u00e3o. At\u00e9 que chega no fim com Lucas tentando se suicidar e no final sem saber que fim deu ele.\nRoteiro: a 1\u00aa metade foi muito boa, depois se perdeu.\nVale apena assistir? sim\nNota: 5",

I sure hope everyone sees this it is so important. Roberts and Hedges are a power dynamic together in the film and at times this one keeps you on edge. The ending really packs an emotional, real punch as well. 5 out of 5.",

Well acted with terrific screenplay, this can't ever be labelled an uplifting picture and nor should it. Everyone seems helplessly trapped in this never-ending cycle of addiction, hope and devastation. Terrific piece of film, if heartbreaking.",
