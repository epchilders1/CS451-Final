In my opinion its just a fun movie filled with good jokes and a surprisingly great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.\n\nDefinitively worth a watch if you are looking too have a laugh.",

The rest of the movie fits perfectly into the overall picture. There could be a sequel.\n\nA movie to end the evening on a light note and de-stress :)\n\nI absolutely love this movie. It's a \"light\" movie to laugh at and watch something fun and light :), the actors and actresses are superbly chosen :)\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to the next installments.\n\nI'd like to add that Zac's performance was perfect, plus his physique is perfect.",
