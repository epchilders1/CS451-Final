He's one of my current favorite heroes in the MCU, and every time I see him on screen, it seems like a melody is playing that not all is lost and that Marvel's ability to \"get there\" has never seemed so easy.",

I really recommend this film for every teenager that likes superhero films. The cast is amazing, especially Tom Holland with his exciting moves. The movie shows how Peter Parker lears to be responsible and brave. It\u00b4s full of energy and humor, and great moments make the film especial.,",

The scenes when they\u2019re in Washington DC and the ship in nyc was really good. I think the surprise and twist at the end wasn\u2019t generational but it was kind of a shock. Tom holland and the actor who plays Ned was actually pretty good and was nice to see another good, street level, Spider-Man movie and was cool to see iron man in this film before he died.",

    "text": "\u2b50 Spoiler Alert \u2013 This review contains mild thematic discussion.\n\nRewatching Spiderman: Homecoming reminded me of how ambitious yet uneven Marvel\u2019s first solo entry for this version of Peter Parker truly is. The film succeeds in its youthful energy, sharp pacing, and strong casting, but it occasionally struggles to capture the emotional and moral depth that defines Spiderman\u2019s character at his core.\n\nAt times, the story leans more toward lighthearted teen comedy than a meaningful hero\u2019s journey. The humor often overshadows the weight of Peter\u2019s responsibilities, making his path feel more like a high school adventure than a defining chapter in his life as a hero. Still, the movie\u2019s tone is undeniably fun and relatable, offering an accessible entry point for younger audiences.\n\nThe high school setting works well in illustrating Peter\u2019s double life, though the balance between his normal struggles and heroic duties isn\u2019t always consistent. Moments that could explore his internal conflict are often resolved too quickly, leaving emotional growth somewhat underdeveloped.\n\nTony Stark\u2019s mentorship adds an interesting layer, but the dynamic sometimes feels more controlling than collaborative. Peter\u2019s independence\u2014one of Spiderman\u2019s defining traits\u2014takes a backseat to Stark\u2019s oversight, which limits the character\u2019s development.\n\nThe portrayal of Aunt May is refreshing in warmth and energy, though some may miss the traditional wisdom and gravity associated with the character. Likewise, omitting certain familiar origin details makes this version of Peter feel more dependent on others than self-made.\n\nMichael Keaton\u2019s performance as the Vulture is easily one of the highlights. His grounded and believable portrayal adds much-needed tension and humanity to the story, giving the film its emotional center.\n\nThe final act delivers the strongest material, bringing back the sense of heart and courage that defines Spiderman. It shows Peter\u2019s selflessness and his growth into the hero he\u2019s meant to be\u2014reminding us why he remains one of Marvel\u2019s most beloved characters.\n\nOverall, Spiderman: Homecoming is an entertaining but imperfect chapter in the web-slinger\u2019s cinematic journey. Its humor and youthful charm make it enjoyable, but some creative choices keep it from reaching the emotional depth and legacy the character deserves. Still, thanks to Tom Holland\u2019s enthusiasm and Michael Keaton\u2019s compelling performance, it remains a fun and heartfelt entry in the Marvel universe.\n\nLAYMAN REVIEW: 7.9/10",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nFresh, funny, and full of youthful energy, Spider-Man: Homecoming brings the wall-crawler back to his roots with a lighthearted spirit and a much-needed sense of fun. Free from another origin story, this reboot swings confidently into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with style and heart.\n\nTom Holland delivers a charming and authentic take on Peter Parker\u2014an eager, relatable teenager trying to balance high school life with superhero responsibilities. Michael Keaton\u2019s Vulture stands out as one of the MCU\u2019s most grounded and menacing villains, giving the film real dramatic weight. Director Jon Watts keeps the tone breezy and fast-paced, blending superhero spectacle with a John Hughes\u2013style coming-of-age story.\n\nWhile it may not reach the emotional highs of Raimi\u2019s classics, Spider-Man: Homecoming succeeds by focusing on character, humor, and heart. It\u2019s a smart, spirited reboot that reminds audiences why Spider-Man remains one of cinema\u2019s most beloved heroes.",

    "text": "Spider-Man Homecoming was the true beginning to Tom Hollands titular character living and operating in the MCU after years of anticipation. Covering the events before, during and mostly after civil war but it struggles, like the character himself, to stand on its own. \n\nThe film is fun enough, with great performances and Chemistry from our new Peter Parker and his relationship with Iron Man as a real high point \u2014 unfortunately, outside of that, no one really stands out. Michael Keaton portrays the Vulture and is visually interesting but, as will become the trend in the sequel, feels more like an Iron Man villain and struggles to build any meaningful relationship with our Protagonist. While Peters personal life does lead to more of a connection to Vulture, it falls mostly flat and feels mainly present to have one twist at the end that feels unearned. Spidey is still rocking his Iron Man created Civil War suit with new AI: Karen. The learning montage of Peter and Karen does make for some funny moments of banter between them but feels less than necessary. Visually, the film relies heavily on CGI for the Spidey. While this allows for more expressive eyes, it makes the character feel less grounded than previous Spider-Men, like Andrew Garfield\u2019s portrayal, which incorporated more practical action and swinging sequences and real suit without constant visual enhancements. Speaking of action, this movie has a fair amount but aside from a small moment on the ferry, really lacks the spectacle you\u2019d expect from both Spider-Man and the MCU. \n\nWhen he first swung into Civil War, I was excited. The Russos wrote him well enough and funny enough that I could get past being less than excited about the visual design on the suit. But the first solo outing for the wall crawler left me wanting more, from the story, the characters and the visuals. His relationship with Tony Stark is fun and interesting but it\u2019s not enough to carry the film, thankfully the threequel nails it later on.",
