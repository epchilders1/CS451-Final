The film's direction is impeccable, its visuals are breathtaking, and its futuristic world is meticulously crafted.

But SO many questions left unanswered as a viewer and so much wasted film time that could've been spent answering them.  Instead this was all about CGI and set design display instead of plot or character development.  Gosling is beautiful as always and that was the only draw to invest the now wasted rental money and time.  Be wary of the tomato and popcorn meters in this case... or you, too, could be led astray!",

I watched this bc I liked \"Her,\" and by contrast that movie was thought-provoking, interesting, fun. This one also deals with some of the same issues of what is real, what is human, and so on, but it just went on and on. So many choices were made that slowed things down to a snail's pace. By the end I wanted all of them to die, I didn't care who was whose son or daughter. And why does Harrison Ford keep hitting everyone to no good purpose? It was almost slapstick (like a goof on his career?), but hard to see that was intended. Also, Ryan Gosling is an attractive actor who seems to be able to act in some movies, but here, he is \"not\" acting for long sequences. This adds to the lack of emotional engagement. Anyway, the whole thing was a complete disaster, and how it gets 88% fresh is beyond me. Ugh.",
