    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Hay pel\u00edculas que se cocinan a fuego lento y otras que, como esta, se sirven con un aire envenenado desde el primer bocado. El men\u00fa atrapa por esa mezcla de thriller, comedia negra y s\u00e1tira social que se va destapando plato a plato, hasta dejar al espectador en una posici\u00f3n inc\u00f3moda y, al mismo tiempo, fascinante.\n\nEl aire teatral con el que est\u00e1 concebida la puesta en escena funciona como un ingrediente clave. Todo transcurre con una coreograf\u00eda calculada, como si estuvi\u00e9ramos en una representaci\u00f3n donde cada gesto, cada silencio y cada mirada forman parte de una obra mayor. Esa sensaci\u00f3n de estar frente a una funci\u00f3n casi ritual le da un atractivo especial.\n\nRalph Fiennes se mueve en el papel de chef como un aut\u00e9ntico maestro de ceremonias, hipn\u00f3tico y perturbador. Su control de la sala es absoluto, hasta el punto de que la tensi\u00f3n se mastica como uno de los platos servidos. Frente a \u00e9l, Anya Taylor-Joy encarna a la \u00fanica voz discordante en un banquete de imposturas, logrando una qu\u00edmica magn\u00e9tica que se convierte en el verdadero motor de la historia.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula juega con la s\u00e1tira de la alta cocina y la obsesi\u00f3n por el lujo, pero sin dejar de lado el suspense y el malestar que genera ver c\u00f3mo cada plato se convierte en un comentario social disfrazado de experiencia culinaria. Hay momentos rid\u00edculos, otros siniestros y alguno que bordea el absurdo, pero siempre con un tono calculadamente inc\u00f3modo que encaja con lo que se quiere contar.\n\nNo ser\u00e1 la reflexi\u00f3n social m\u00e1s profunda ni el thriller m\u00e1s afilado, pero como espect\u00e1culo funciona de principio a fin. Es un men\u00fa que no deja indiferente: grotesco, elegante y cruel a partes iguales. Una experiencia que, como toda buena cena, se disfruta m\u00e1s por el viaje que por el \u00faltimo bocado.\n\n(ENGLISH) Some films simmer slowly, while others, like this one, serve their poison from the very first bite. The Menu hooks you with its blend of thriller, dark comedy, and social satire, unfolding course by course until the viewer is left both uncomfortable and fascinated.\n\nThe theatrical atmosphere in the staging is a key ingredient. Everything moves with choreographed precision, as if we were watching a performance where each gesture, silence, and look is part of a greater design. That sense of ritual makes it even more engaging.\n\nRalph Fiennes inhabits the role of the chef as a true master of ceremonies, hypnotic and disturbing. His command of the room is absolute, and the tension becomes as tangible as one of the dishes being served. Opposite him, Anya Taylor-Joy embodies the lone voice of defiance at this banquet of pretension, and the chemistry between them is magnetic, driving the story forward.\n\nThe film pokes fun at haute cuisine and the obsession with luxury, but it never loses its sharp edge of suspense and unease, turning each dish into a social commentary disguised as a culinary experience. There are moments of absurdity, sinister touches, and even laughable extremes, but all of it fits into a carefully orchestrated discomfort.\n\nIt may not be the deepest social critique or the sharpest thriller, but as a spectacle it works from start to finish. This is a menu that doesn\u2019t leave you indifferent: grotesque, elegant, and cruel in equal measure. An experience that, like a great dinner, is savored more for the journey than for the final bite.",

    "text": "Another film containing insults about God and Jesus Christ. The main male character uses the phrase \"Holy f...ing...\", which is a strong profanity, already two minutes into the film (00:02:14). The main  female character uses the phrase \"Jesus f...ing Christ\" at 01:34:10. Why?! Couldn't these insults be replaced? The actors repeatedly use God's name in vain from the very beginning and throughout the film. Why do they decide to sell their souls for their careers?\nWhat is wrong with film directors today? They use so many offensive and disrespectful words that some viewers might perceive as blasphemy and mockery. Why do they hate Christians so much? They never mock other religions.\nI lose respect for directors and actors who choose to use such offensive scripts.",

The story was gripping from start to finish, blending tension, mystery, and dark humor in a way that keeps you hooked. A clever and well-executed concept that serves up both thrills and social commentary, definitely a feast!",

    "text": "The focus of the film rests entirely on Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance not only captures the viewer's attention but also establishes a rhythm and tension that permeate every scene. Every gesture, every nuance of her interpretation demonstrates an absolute mastery of cinematic language. For her ability to carry the film with authority and precision, I award her an outstanding rating.\nThe narrative is very similar to the series Squid Game, where the captors already had information about the people before they even entered the location where they would be held. The suspense builds gradually, showing the fear of each individual until all the restaurant\u2019s guests realize the gravity of the situation.\nThe development of the culinary experience is presented in an omakase style, with the chef crafting his art directly in front of the clients; there is no rigid menu, only a real-time gastronomic performance. The lighting reinforces professionalism while accentuating the drama and tension, aided by chefs whose presence seems to go beyond that of ordinary cooks.\nChef Slowik\u2019s white attire conveys depth, authority, and control, while the darker tones of the rest of the cast enhance the visual suspense. There is no room for joy or distraction.\nThe scene transitions and timing chosen by the editor are spectacular, amplifying every key moment of suspense.\nThe CGI is seamlessly integrated, requiring not much of the green screen; but both the exterior and interior shots feel entirely realistic. The image quality is impeccable: outstanding sharpness and clarity, precise color grading, perfectly balanced lighting and exposure, and resolution that conveys absolute realism.",

Has everyone been brought up in the gutter? And no surprises that obesity is rife in the USA with the size of that cheeseburger! Good acting but a rubbish film.",
