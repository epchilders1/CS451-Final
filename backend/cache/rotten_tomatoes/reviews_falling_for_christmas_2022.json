A rich girl falls and hits her head, forgetting who she is, and the handsome blue collar man \"saves\" her in more ways than one. If you love rom coms and Christmas movies this is perfect! Don\u2019t take it too serious, just enjoy the movie and you\u2019ll love it!",

    "text": "Filme: Uma Quedinha de Natal\t\tAssistido:  5-12-24\nElenco: @lindsaylohan @chordoverstreet @oliviamonetperez @jackwagnerofficial @instageorgey \nModelo: #natalino #romance #com\u00e9dia\nDura\u00e7\u00e3o: 1h 35m \tAno: 2022\nMinha opini\u00e3o: Este filme de Lindsay de Natal acredito ser o melhor dela at\u00e9 hoje. O seu rosto esta com aquele botox, onde n\u00e3o vemos express\u00e3o facial, ou quando sorri estica tudo. Kkkkk. E como sempre, quando falamos de filme de Natal tem sempre uma est\u00f3ria de amor acontecendo. Claro que existe suas exce\u00e7\u00f5es como \u201cEsqueceram de Mim\u201d. Aqui temos Sierra que depois de esquecer de quem \u00e9 se torna Sarah (Lohan), cheia de frescura onde nunca fez nada. Temos seu namorado Tad, tamb\u00e9m um cara cheio de frescura. E nomomento que ele vai pedir a m\u00e3o de Sierra e neste momento ela escorrega e cai montanha a abaixo e bate sua cabe\u00e7a e esquece tudo. E salva por Jake (Chord)  que \u00e9 pai de Avy (Perez) que fez o pedido ao Papai Noel que seu pai encontre um novo amor, pois ele \u00e9 vi\u00favo. Ser\u00e1 que seu pedido ser\u00e1 atendido? E no tempo que ela passa na pousada de Jake ela ajuda na pousada, fazendo de tudo que nunca fez. E gosta desta nova experi\u00eancia e nesse momento ela se aproxima da Avy e Jake. Mas quando tudo parecia acontecer ela \u00e9 encontrada pelo seu pai e Tad e relembra de quem \u00e9. Mas agora ela esta mudada. E deixa Tad e vive feliz com Jake e Avy.\nRoteiro e enredo este filme foi muito legal. Um roteiro simples, ing\u00eanuo, mas funcional.\nVale apena assistir? Sim recomendo neste momento natalino.\nNota: 7",

You watch this film because you want a seasonal boost of cheer.\n\nOne thing....was expecting the Santa character to close out the final scene with sled and reindeers coming up and through the screen at the audience. Cliche, yes, but it would have put a bow on the top!",

Lindsay Lohan plays the role of Sierra/Sarah to perfection, and the Mean Girl reference is the cherry on top.\n\nA classic sweet, romantic Christmas movie where love can bloom in just 4 days and the whole town can gather on Christmas Eve. If you can look past realism and logic, the movie is definitely worth watching and will get you 100% in the Christmas spirit!",

    "text": "As Christmas movies go, it captured the magic, whimsy and family cheerful vibes one might expect. It's a step-up production and charm wise from your typical Hallmark Christmas movie. In large part, the production / directing team makes a basic premise a chill and fun watch that helps you escape into a simpler time, and Lindsay Lohan's charisma, star power and sweetness elevates the good-natured feel. The light-hearted repertoire and physical comedy is good for the whole family. A shoutout to Tad (played by George Young), as the superficial fianc\u00e9. He made his snooty character likeable in the most \"Chad\" like way and his comedic delivery was great. I do have to note that the main couple's chemistry was a bit lackluster with just a few glances that hinted the audience. There isn't really any twists and turns, and the story is quite predictable, but if there's good vibes, that's kind of all that matters in an enjoyable Christmas movie. Otherwise, the movie is a worth a watch for the holidays.",
