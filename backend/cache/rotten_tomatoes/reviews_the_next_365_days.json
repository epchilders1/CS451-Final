    "text": "The sequel to \"365 Days\" worsens the issues of the original, delivering an even more superficial and incoherent narrative. The characters remain shallow, with unconvincing motivations, while the plot feels like a series of disjointed scenes designed solely to shock.\n\nEmotional development is nonexistent, and attempts to deepen the protagonists' conflicts fail, relying on clich\u00e9s and weak dialogue. The romanticization of toxic relationships remains a highly problematic aspect.\n\nAlthough the production retains a flashy aesthetic, it is not enough to make up for the lack of substance. The sequel reinforces that its focus is on provocation rather than telling a meaningful story.",

    "text": "Of all the pointless and absurd movies I've watched, this one takes the top spot. It's supposed to be a love story, but it fails miserably. By the end, it's still unclear whether the main characters end up together or not. The plot is confusing and poorly developed, leaving you with more questions than answers. Instead of wrapping things up, it feels like the film just stops abruptly. This lack of resolution makes the whole experience frustrating and unsatisfying. Overall, it's a complete waste of time and fails to deliver any meaningful or coherent storyline. The characters lack depth and their relationships are underdeveloped, which only adds to the confusion.",

    "text": "If I were in the mood to watch adult content, Netflix would definitely not be my first choice. The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.\n\n\"365 Days\" seems to be all about sex and trying to engage the audience solely on that basis. The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.\n\nDespite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made. I only watched the sequel because I had seen the first one and felt compelled to review both at the same time, even though I found them both to be quite terrible.",

    "text": "I watched all 3 parts. This is the third and, supposedly, last part. All of this trilogy was terrible. Nonexistent script and dialogue. Terrible acting. Stupid, unconvincing, and unbelievable plot and storyline. Just boring, neverending, and meaningless nudity and sex with mostly the same 3 unlikeable and despicable characters. The worst thing ever was that every 2 to 5 minutes a new idiotic song was played from an extremely annoying soundtrack of very untalented singers. The directors must have thought they were filming a music video. This was the case in all 3 parts. The neverending barrage of songs became so unbearable and annoying that I was going to switch the movie off many times. The only reason I continued to watch this trainwreck till the end, when I should have quit, is that I had invested too much time watching the first two parts- which were also disasters. This whole trilogy is unwatchable and is depraved nonsense.",

This movie should be fast-forwarded to the next movie instead of staying in the midst of the unknown and then leaving us there not knowing whom she will pick. Basically, it's getting to the point that you'd rather just watch the ending than waste your time watching the whole movie filled with uncertainty of the main character.",
