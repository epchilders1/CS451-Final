Is the waterman real? did the water man find the body of his beloved that he was searching for? was he able to help his mother which was the whole point of the journey? What happened to the other characters? hopefully, there is a sequel to sort this all out.",

The water man has a stone that can save anyone. It is a decent story that tries to be a bit fantasy and magical. But the direction lacks its tone its trying to be. The acting is decent. The film does lose its tone with what its trying to be. But entertaining.",

    "text": "The Water Man is a very entertaining family adventure. The young boy in the lead was great. David Oyelowo and Rosario Dawson also play their parts well. The story was consistently interesting. I liked the themes of the film and how they were handled. The film was kid friendly without alienating adults. There were a few moments that felt childish but it felt natural. I was one step ahead of the plot at times, but Oyelowo\u2019s direction keeps things engaging. Overall, I really liked this. It\u2019s just a very sweet and charming film. I\u2019m excited to see what Oyelowo does next behind the camera.",
