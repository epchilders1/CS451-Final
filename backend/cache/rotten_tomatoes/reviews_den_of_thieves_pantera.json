    "text": "Christian Gudegast's sequel \"Den of Thieves: Pantera\" ditches the tone of its predecessor, the sleaziness & where the line begins to blur between what we perceive as the heroes & villains. Gudegast direction leaves American soil behind to take the next heist to the European continent for a creative heist team up. \n\nThe opening heist in Belgium is just a teaser for what is coming. The preparation to hit the World Diamond Centre in France which is worth every minute as once it starts, it's carefully executed & heart pounding tension on top of being treated to a solid car chase & shootout sequence on route to the Italian border.\n\nGerard Butler returns as Big Nick & he still has his sleazy side like he's on edge to rip your throat out.",

Neste 2\u00ba filme tem o desafio de superar o 1\u00ba, por\u00e9m isso n\u00e3o ocorreu. Esta gera\u00e7\u00e3o de atores de a\u00e7\u00e3o ja est\u00e3o em baixa; Nicolas Cage, Liam Neeson, Segal, Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson,.... e  temos Butler. E este filme \u00e9 uma mostra disso. Um que traz de volta Donnie (O\u2019Shea) que ap\u00f3s roubar um banco com os diamantes de um mafioso, quer usar para um roubo maior, para isso sua quadrilha formada de policiais corruptos, aparece Big (Butler) dizendo que havia virado a casaca e entra na quadrilha. Na hora do roubo, as coisas d\u00e3o mais ou menos certas, bem na hora da fuga, parte da quadrilha \u00e9 alvejada pela m\u00e1fia e quando fogem s\u00e3o pegos pela pol\u00edcia na fronteira. E na verdade Big, estava infiltrado para capturar os policiais corruptos. \nVale a pena assistir?: Se n\u00e3o tiver outra op\u00e7\u00e3o.\nNota: 4",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Den of Thieves: Pantera\" (2025) is a sequel to a heist action thriller \"Den of Thieves\". This is a sequel that i never thought they will be making, but i guess first film was a mild success. This time around it takes place in France and we do get to see two characters from a first film of course. I didn't liked this film as much as first one - that film was better in nearly every way, while wasn't great one either. \"Pantera\" isn't bad film by any means, but it wasn't just very interesting. Pacing was so so, and the whole third act while fun to watch was a bit to much convoluted for me taste. Acting was just OK for this material, nothing to write home about.\n\nOverall, \"Den of Thieves: Pantera\" is a let down in comparison with previous film, but it isn't the worst sequel out there by far either. It is mildly entertaining and i liked the premise, but execution wasn't very good.",

Good cinematography and very well written and brought to screen. Lots of action, twists, charm, charisma, mystery and drama. Very entertaining",
