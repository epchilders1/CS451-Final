Super slick and fans of Fassbender will love it. \n\nGreat, if not too short, performance by the Cue Tip \ud83d\ude09\n\nMy only real gripe was the length - it could\u2019ve achieved and executed, (excuse the pun), its objective and taken 20 minutes less time. \n\nHappy viewing guys\u2026",

    "text": "Quite reluctant at first, I let myself get drawn in. Here we follow a hitman who is supposed to be cold and amoral and, of course, always successful. Except that one day he misses his target, and that's when the trouble starts. He is attacked and has to track down the shooter and the person who hired him. \nThe beginning made me smile with its cold tones and cold wave music, good nihilism where nothing matters, nothing makes sense, desaturated colors, like season 1 of True Detective, but without the atmosphere. \nSome people like it, but I'm not so sure. \nI had this unpleasant feeling of a mix between Nic Pizzolatto's series and the movie Fight Club, no doubt David Fincher's influence. The second tropical part is nice, but nothing more. \nSo yes, it's beautiful, it's smooth, it's cold, but it's a revenge movie like Taken, only much better. \nWhat bothered me was the rather facile criticism of the luxurious lifestyle of the powerful, with its ultra-stylish, rootless elements, large empty houses, and technological gadgets. On the other hand, there is noise and dirt. It's probably quite realistic, but other films have already dealt with this postmodern emptiness, and perhaps better. \nEnjoyable to watch, but rather pointless, just like the vision of luxury and power that it denounces.",

Because at the end of the day, you're still human \u2014 not a god.\n\nAnd if you fail, that\u2019s okay.\n\nNo matter how irreversible the outcome, no matter how heavy the consequences, all you need to do is breathe and stay calm.\n\nKeep your reason.

    "text": "Finchers style is heavy in this movie, which does have some good parts. I found the opening sequence where the main character says \"if you can't handle boredom\" you're not going to make it in this business, to be prophetic for the rest of the movie. \n\nThere is plenty going on in the film, but you never quite feel attached to any character. The protagonists girlfriend is treated purely as a plot point to motivate the assassin. Her brother is the worst actor in the film and is supposed to help up the stakes, but the whole hospital scene falls flat and doesn't feel like enough. \n\nSPOILERS:\n\nHe spends most of the film monologuing about his own rules and how they don't permit mercy or empathy only for the main antagonist to receive mercy. He along the way kills at least one completely innocent person. He himself possibly kills someones girlfriend which is his whole motivation for revenge?\n\nThe character and this movie is filled with contradictions that don't feel on-purpose.  Lots of talking about how competent the main character is, but not much showing. The opening sequence he's hiding in a dark room away from a window, but has a spotlight on him. No one notices him. \n\nI ended the film feeling badly for 3/4 people he killed and disliking the assassin.",
