This movie never disappoints. This movie also manages to have the perfect cast of Danny McBride, Abbi Jacobson, Maya Rudolph, Mike Rianda, Eric Andre, and Olivia Colman. It's the perfect movie that deserves all of the love it can get. And I mean all of it.",

    "text": "An artistic & amazing family movie.\n\nThe casting was nailed. Abbi Jacson as Katie Mitchell sounded very realistic as an 18-year-old as I hear them. Maya Rudolph is obviously, the mom who is Linda. It was funny to have a grown man, Mike Rianda, portray Aaron, the youngest. And Olivia Coleman was the best with portraying the evil phone device/AI who was PAL.\n\nThe animation is also creative & artistic: the general looks so like clay 2D but it is working. Then there is editing with 2D drawings/collages adding onto scenes so a Mitchell made this movie more appealing & live action cutouts.\n\nIt is real humorous. Many quotes from it will go down in history. The portrayal of PALs fate in a glass of water was hilarious (the way she reacted) - these do not always have to be dark & brutal.\n\nAnd the characterization is the best part. Katie is a filmmaker & used to have a great relationship with her father (who was technophobic) but got strained & the family was dysfunctional. The Mitchell's were not ideal unlike others (I.e: the Poseys). When PAL would be sending away the \"foolish\" humans, this dysfunctional family must function to save humanity. Those Mitchell's had outsmarted AI - they are wierd & according to the movie \"Spies in Disguise\", the world needs anybody wierd - wierd can be cool.\n\nSo - natural/human intelligence can be better than Artificial Intelligence.",
