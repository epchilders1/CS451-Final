    "text": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nDeep Impact is the thinking person\u2019s disaster movie: a surprisingly somber, deeply human end-of-the-world story that dares to care more about grief, sacrifice, and quiet heroism than explosions (even when it has plenty of those).\n\nReleased the same summer as Armageddon, this one actually treats the apocalypse like adults. The comet isn\u2019t just a rock; it\u2019s a countdown clock ticking over ordinary people making impossible choices. T\u00e9a Leoni\u2019s journalist wrestling with her estranged parents while breaking the biggest story in history, Robert Duvall leading the Messiah crew on a suicide mission with nothing but grace and gallows humor, Elijah Wood getting married at 17 because tomorrow isn\u2019t promised; every subplot lands because the characters feel real, not caricatures.\n\nMorgan Freeman\u2019s President Beck is still one of the most reassuring fictional leaders ever put on screen (that voice could calm a hurricane), and the final act doesn\u2019t cheat: when the smaller comet hits and that East-Coast tsunami sequence rolls in with zero music, just the roar of water and James Horner\u2019s heartbreaking choir, it\u2019s legitimately terrifying. The last twenty minutes are pure, unashamed tearjerker territory: the astronaut farewells, the baby named after a doomed hero, the father carrying his daughter one last time\u2026 grab tissues.\n\nIt loses half a star only because some of the younger-cast drama feels a bit after-school-special at times, and the CGI tidal wave hasn\u2019t aged perfectly.\n\nFour stars: one for the cast giving Oscar-worthy work in a \"disaster\" movie, one for never insulting your intelligence, one for the emotional devastation that still wrecks me every rewatch, and one because in a genre full of Michael Bay noise, this one whispers \"We love you, goodbye\" and means it.\n\nUnderrated 90s classic.  \n8/10. The sky really is falling\u2026 and somehow it still makes you feel less alone when it does. \u2604\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\u2764\ufe0f",

    "text": "Despite growing up in the 90s, I was completely unaware of this movie.  It was amazing! and honestly, refreshing to see an extinction-level event related to a comet, as opposed to the typical bad guy/world war.\n\nThis movie made me nostalgic as well for the good 'ol 90s.  Happy this movie randomly came into my sight, it was great!",

The production design\u2014from the spaceships to the costumes to James Horner's commendable score\u2014does earn some points for being better pretty much across the board though.",

The script really moves like a textbook\u2026.instead of entertaining you and telling you a story, the bulk of the time is spent educating and convincing you why each part of the movie is practical.",
