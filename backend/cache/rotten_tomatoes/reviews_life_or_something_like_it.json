I don't want to give the movie away but it's a good watch if you want a movie you don't have to think alot about. The actors, the male and female protagonist (Edward Burns and Angelina Jolie) both, did a great job, I thought. I wouldn't watch it again, but I like what it thought me.",

The story of the movie was too dramatic and bizarre. It's about fear of death and living life everyday like it's your last. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you might like it. I didn't like very much though.",

    "text": "This movie was ahead of its time. It's not perfect by any means, but it weaves together many seemingly disparate parts together to demonstrate a Dark Night of the Soul and the Ego's undoing in a way that was still palatable to the masses. Stockyard Channing excellently portrayed one who did not allow her own Dark Night of the Soul, pushing through to the glittery dreams an empty promises of Egoic accolades and fame. The need for Hollywood to include a romantic relationship and keep a movie under 2 hours were sort of at odds, however, it had a sweet ending, and I was very happy for Laney in the end. People get awfully distracted by Angelina Jolie's looks, and I think that's a shame, because she is an excellent actor, and shines in many different kinds of roles. She was very believable as Laney.",

Could have worked out a more interesting way to address the way that a person reacts when they know that their days are counted nevertheless some cameos and some good acting is always a nice thing to watch.",

The end of the film had me in tears - empowered, uplifted. \n\nThis film is thoughtful, original (contrary to the 21st century corporate money by numbers film making ), and tells a story of what it means to be alive....hint - it's not having the best rating.\n\nI respect this film. I'd actually watch it again - as it inspired me to live well. If you're sick of negativity - doomsday living, drama, trauma and divisiveness, you will be thankful you watched this film.",
