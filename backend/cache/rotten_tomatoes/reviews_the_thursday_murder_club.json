    "text": "\u201c The Thursday Murder Club\u201d is the movie about four friends in a retirement home that decide to try to solve unsolve murderers For fun. This movie is based on a Richard Osmond\u2019s best seller and the adaptation of this bestseller. Ultimately these four friends while having fun trying to solve unsolvable murders become entangled in an active case. The movie is basically a comedy with this a little twist of suspense and drama. I highly recommend this film for adult age people very good",

    "text": "I am a tough critic. Generally with strong opinions, besides a background of education and experience, I particularly have a background in acting and in film. I (and my partner, also of elite experience) loved this film. Great cast, wonderfully directed, and filmed. Basically, just Delightful! Is it perfect? No. Will it go down as a top all time movie? No. Therefore it cannot get a total 5 stars from me. But it is a total delight.\nBrosnan is good, but he is the weakest of the leads. Mirren is slumming a bit through first half (yet still very good), but locks in by the end. Pryce, Kingsley, Imrie (who is working very hard to be on equal footing with her genius co-stars), Ackie, Tennant, Bell, are most excellent. Mays is perfect stereotype schlump cop, without stealing or over hamming. All in such total teamwork, as the best of British acting often is.\nSet design and camera work are so subtly 'right on'. The script is 'light', yet wonderfully playful, and twisted in a delightful and intriguing way. A most subtle intelligence to it, and novel's translation to film. So many murders, so many characters, so much history, intertwined.",

    "text": "The Thursday Murder Club emerges as a surprisingly refined cinematic adaptation of an already impeccable novel. The work carried out by the director shines with precision, coherence, and a keen sense of rhythm: every stylistic choice preserves the narrative elegance of Richard Osman\u2019s book, translating it into images that remain faithful to its original identity.\n\nThe cast delivers a high-level ensemble performance. Mirren, Brosnan, Kingsley, and Imrie clearly enjoy bringing to life characters who, despite being caught in the midst of a mystery, never lose their humanity, wit, or depth. Their interpretations go beyond simply replicating the literary counterparts: they amplify and enrich them, making each one instantly recognizable and irresistibly engaging.\n\nThe direction crafts an atmosphere that feels warm and intimate without sacrificing the thrill of investigation. The result is an intelligently entertaining film, offering two hours of genuine immersion in a story that is original, well-paced, and surprisingly moving.\n\nA faithful, respectful, and thoroughly worthy adaptation of its source material.\nA film that deserves attention and proves that even an apparently lighthearted mystery can become quality cinema.\n\nMy compliments. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd1d",

I've read that it's not very faithful to the book, but as someone who hasn't read it, I found it entertaining enough. The cast (Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie) is marvelous, and they embody their characters perfectly. It's just a fun, enjoyable watch.",

This clearly should be a series!!!! Each of his books could be a 6 part series where those relationships could grow and bring people in. I love The Thursday Murder Club, but, alas, I did not love this movie.",

They could have at least used a filter as everyone looked like dried up raisins. Its meant to be Hollywood after all. I wouldn't waste your time on this flick.",

It\u2019s not the whodunit plot that engages the audience, however, so much as the performances and magnetism of screen stalwarts such as Helen Mirron and Pearce Bronson.",

I pray that Osmand's next four books will  be cast with the same actors with consistent attention to the content and characters in the books. To the director Chris Columbus: What happened??",

Although, for some reason, they have given Pierce Brosnan an accent which was a bad move as he is so terrible at accents!

    "text": "In fear of repeating probably what a lot of others have said, (and a common book reader fault), \n\nThey took a book that was short and concise and somehow they changed the characters, behaviors and scenes to something that makes absolutely no sense. \n\nI think the book read pretty much like a movie and if they went ahead and stick with it they would have made a movie that both the people that read the books would love and those that didn't. \n\nUnfortunately now the characters felt flat. Even the main characters felt like they didn't have a life before they started solving murders. There are characters in the movie that were changed entirely to represent something ... weird that probably was an addition of someone that wanted to make their own impression on this story. \n\nPity. Good book ( i know i know) bad movie.",
