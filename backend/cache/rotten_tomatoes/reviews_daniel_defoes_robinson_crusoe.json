    "text": "An adventure survival drama based on Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1719 novel of the same name, set in 1703, in which Crusoe departs Scotland for a year but, after months at sea, a violent storm wrecks his ship. He becomes the sole survivor, stranded on a desolate island.\nWhile it is undeniably a product of its time\u2014reflecting outdated notions of white superiority that have not aged well\u2014it still offers moments of nostalgic entertainment. Pierce Brosnan is far from his finest here, and the film takes significant liberties with the source material. Yet, despite its flaws, it served as an enjoyable reminder of the novel I read two decades ago. Unfortunately, the ending diverges sharply from the original story, which somewhat diminished the overall impact for me.",

    "text": "I watched this movie with moderately acceptable interest for the first hour. It has a kind of TV movie stink to it, but it's not horrible. Bland, yes; white savior-y, yes (but that might be from the source material which I've never read). Pierce Brosnan's beard changes constantly. On the ship before the boat crashes he has a kind of goatee and stache thing going, but no cheek hair, but after the crash he grows a full beard. Also he wakes up face down in the water. Fuck's up with that? Also his Jesus speech was a bit overcooked, and overall he's not entirely convincing. But still, it's okay, Maybe my opinion of the film is heightened because I'm comfortably relaxing in a Korean hotel, sitting on the heated toilet seat, receiving an incredibly satisfying bidet/enema from the toilet, which, all things considered, could make any film acceptable no matter how uninspiring it truly is.",

The Film seems unfinished somehow, with many pivotal moments missing. It never lives up to its potential, but there are signs of a good film in there, unfortunately they didn't \"bring it\" for this one.",
