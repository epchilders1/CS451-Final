And yet, still, it's worth a watch. Can't explain or justify why \ud83d\ude02",

The movie does have some unbelievability or even thoughts of \"why didn't he do this or that\", but overall I would recommend it as a really fun movie.",

The actors really nailed these roles, particularly Ethan: subtle, natural, likable, and not too showy while leaving room for growth as the plot expanded. A feeling of close confinement defines this movie, with the entire plot feeling tense, quick, and inescapable.",

Out-of-the-box plot, twist, twist, twist, non-stop tension and conflict, never 'jumps-the-shark\", terrifically acted, directed, and a really good script, which should give a clue as to why Bateman and Egerton were signed on. Once all the exposition is out of the way, it's one hell of a ride. Rotten Tomatoes PopcornMeter, or whatever it is, gives it a mediocre score, while the Critics give it a VERY respectable 88. Trust the Critics on this one.",
