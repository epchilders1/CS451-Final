    "text": "First off, I thought the two lead actors look like they could be cousins and so it was a weird casting choice to have them not be related in the movie. Well, it turns out they literally are cousins. Okay.\n\nThe movie's fine. Even good, I guess. The world they built is cool, and I wanted more of that: the politics, the cultures, the socio-political landscape. I wanted a bigger scope, which is the kind of thing I usually want from sci-fi. Show me what the governments are up to, whether the police force is corrupt, stuff like that. In a dystopian world like this, you just know there's a lot more happening than the smaller, emotional, familial story they chose to tell.\n\nThat story, mother and son, is kind of rote, and it wasn't even executed all that well. I found myself not really caring. Robbie Amell didn\u2019t sell the emotion for me, maybe because his character was making shady choices, which is harder to connect with.\n\nThe special effects were good, the class-based powers were interesting, but overall it felt like two movies smashed together. The first half worked better. It had world-building, newsreels, learning about powers, the drugs, the syndicate. The second half, with the son desperate to save his mother, was much smaller in scope, and I just wasn\u2019t into it. The pacing really dragged there.",

I would like to say something nice but I can't think of anything positive about this film.  It sometimes has nice camera shots that reminds me of District 9 that's pretty much it. Is it really only just over an hour and a half \ud83d\ude32",

    "text": "Watchable trash. Quite boring at times for an action thriller about mutants with super powers - I was fast forwarding certain scenes by the end. Mildly charismatic performances by several actors is probably the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Weird tone shifts between the mutants doing \u201cbadass\u201d stuff versus trying to make the audience care about the plight of side characters we\u2019ve spent about 3 total minutes of screen time with. Lots of telling not showing to rush through the extremely contrived plot (the movie is mercifully brief), plot threads that go nowhere left and right, nonsensical character motivations. Those with fully functional brains should steer clear.",

His acting was borderline cringe.\n\nThe rest of the cast did good, the writing is okay (the clich\u00e9 of good cop/bad cop I hoped had a certain meaning but it is way too cheesy).\n\nBut I appreciate the effort and idea of the story.",

The plot of the movie was dramatic and thrilling. It's about doing whatever you can to help the people you love, even if you have superpowers. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",
