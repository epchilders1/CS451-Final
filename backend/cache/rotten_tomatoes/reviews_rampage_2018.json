    "text": "It\u2019s no masterpiece by ANY means, but \u201cRampage (2018)\u201d is an enjoyable popcorn flick in all the right ways.\n\nThe CG is way better than what I was expecting and definitely enhances the experience when the monsters go on their titular tirade. It\u2019s basically a big-budget Syfy Original movie, or even a modern-day Showa or Heisei Era Godzilla movie. It\u2019s incredibly stupid, but just stupid enough to still enjoy the ride. It\u2019s the kind of movie that I\u2019d like to call \u201cdelightfully stupid.\u201d\n\nDwayne Johnson is a fairly decent lead actor for this kind of movie and he\u2019s well aware of what kind of movie he signed on for here. Even when the monsters aren\u2019t on screen, Dwayne Johnson manages to keep things entertaining long enough until it\u2019s time to shake things up with some cheesy kaiju action.\n\nI\u2019ve never played any of the original games it\u2019s based on, but on its own merit, \u201cRampage: The Movie\u201d is a moderately entertaining movie that\u2019s serviceable to those looking for some cheap thrills or for having a giant monster movie marathon.",

Well done to WETA Digital and all other VFX companies involved, very detailed iteration. Whole cast also great in character. The \"mindless\", ridiculous\" and \"boring\" scores from critics are irrelevant, aren't all movies like that? It's a MOVIE!, I enjoyed it a lot",

The movie felt very influenced by movies such as Jurassic World and King Kong and Godzilla but still stood out. I actually learned a lot about CRISPR in my biology class and so a lot of it felt very familiar and not confusing. Definitely one of my favorite Rock movies.",
