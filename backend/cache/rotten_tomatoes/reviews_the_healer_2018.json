Properly invested, I would hazard to say more funds could have been raised and viewers wouldn't lose 2 hours of time.\n\nThe story is poorly contrived, at best. The acting, while not the worst I've seen, is not helped nor does it help the story. Please leave the Bible to tell the stories of faith. The only inspiration this provides is that of donating directly to your charity of choice -- not supporting d-rated attempts at bolstering faith that are really just capitalist Christian circle jerks in disguise.",

The cast was so likable and they did a great job at delivering the message in the story. The location of the movie was beautiful.  I definitely recommend this movie.",

By the end I realized that the portrayal was an accurate description of one of the many convoluted ways in which God can and does work.",

I don't feel that the lacking part of this movie are the actors, no I feel that the direction moved in a very strange way. Hard to explain but it felt stilted and hesitant then plowed ahead so fast that it just didn't have a good flow sort of stuttering back and forth.\n  The premise of the healer would have been better played as confused not angry. I don't blame the actor. \nThe background musical choices were uninspiring and more distracting than providing accompaniment and emotional texture.\nNot horrible but not worth the time really. \nI wish that I could say that it was quirky but I can't and that's just sad.",

He wants his gift back but is told no by his uncle so he goes to a church in the middle of the night to yell at God and gets his gift back. \n\u2022The end. \n\u2022I hated this show.

We are not religious but the message of hope, friendship, compassion, and love is universal and needed. If you have not had enough life experiences to realize the value of a movie like this then you should not be commenting. Thank you to the actors, producers, director, and everyone involved in making this movie. We wish you the best. To the commenters who have given a bad review of this movie because of their disdain for religion or their perceived attack on homosexuality, you are sadly missing the point and value of this movie.",
