    "text": "Me Time (2022) \u2014 starring Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg \u2014 should\u2019ve been a surefire comedy hit. With a duo known for their charisma and comedic timing, expectations were high for something outrageous, funny, and wildly entertaining.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falls flat on almost every level.\n\nThe humor feels forced, the pacing drags, and both Hart and Wahlberg are guilty of overacting to the point where scenes become exhausting instead of amusing. Wahlberg, in particular, seems to push way too hard in moments that don\u2019t require it, turning what could\u2019ve been subtle laughs into awkward stretches of screen time. And Kevin Hart, though undeniably talented, leans so heavily into his usual shtick that it feels recycled and hollow.\n\nRegina Hall, while a strong actress in many projects, feels miscast here. She doesn\u2019t quite ground the film the way her character should. Instead, her role feels more like an afterthought or parody than a meaningful addition to the story. There\u2019s a lack of chemistry and purpose for her character that makes her presence feel underutilized.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest\u2014the only thing anyone seems to talk about with this film is Mark Wahlberg\u2019s nude scene. If that\u2019s the most memorable takeaway, then the film clearly missed the mark.\n\nMe Time is forgettable, frustrating, and ultimately a waste of potential (and budget). A film with this much star power shouldn\u2019t feel this bland, but somehow it does.",
