    "text": "I love movies like this! - Movies that conjure up feelings of fear and sadness, yet, thrill-seeking and perseverance.  It excites the senses!  What it does not do, is motivate one to embrace \u201cclimate change\u201d and invest emotionally / monetarily into \u201csolutions\u201d to this inevitable and unstoppable phenomenon.  Sure, climate change / global warming exists- but is there anything we can do about it?  The answer is an emphatic \u201chell no\u201d.  Hypothetically, if everyone on the planet (6 billion+) were to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint, Planet Earth would still erode.  Reducing their carbon footprint may slow this erosion, but the results would be negligible.  This is because God has other plans.  For this planet WILL die off with or without our input.  God knows what he\u2019s doing \ud83d\ude09.",

Political figures ignoring the science. Check. Funny watching the Mexican government block US people fleeing into mexico for safety. Won\u2019t be so easy now if Trump finishes his wall. Walls keep things out but can also be a prison for those inside. \nPretty looking picture. Good cast. Environmental fx were good. Great sound lots of lfe noise of the storms. Enjoyable if feeling a little too real for comfort. Maybe that\u2019s the point\u2026",

    "text": "Pay attention all you film fans this is movie is a life lesson on climate change it presents it with realism and courage and it does well combining it with an unpredictable plot of Dennis quaid and others wanting to help survive and/or evacuate the ice age era and it interesting how Jake gyllenhall a great actor he is is with friends caught in the disaster. Don\u2019t be deceived by the errors in science because as long as there is involving drama/ dramatic tension and suspense just like in that of a Hitchcock movie then this movie is not predictable and that it sparks \ud83e\udde8 your interest and attention after all it\u2019s not like some typical mindless blockbuster it had intelligence such as the charachters being serious and the acting as mature. And where the interactions between these charachters are compelling and have development and motivations you get invested in how gyllenhall has a relationship with his father and they reconcile as well as the plot line of him and Emmy Rossum ( she was also in that awful remake Poseidon and she is way better here and making a better teen love interest here with gyllenhall than whoever she was in love with in that awful remake. ) this is a perfect movie to watch on a snowy stormy day in winter and this film should be shown in schools during science classes on climate change emmerich is like the real school teacher here. It\u2019s thought provoking with it musical score and scenes that happen in the film. Emmerich is a True filmmaking god hope he wins an Oscar one day. And they say this or 2012 are the mother of disaster movies and i agree as a result how can it be bad when it is the ultimate disaster movie as it\u2019s not an ordinary one because of how it happened around the world everywhere it\u2019s more of an apocalypse disaster. We have enough human emotion here along with hearfelt moments towards the end like that father and son reunion this is a really good movie and emmerich should be proud of himself I would easily give this a perfect ten if it weren\u2019t for the science errors like the climate change happening fast but outside of that this film needs love and praise for its suspense, drama, plot, and tension it  has along with emotion and human touch it\u2019s an absolute must see for those reasons \u26c8\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0e",
