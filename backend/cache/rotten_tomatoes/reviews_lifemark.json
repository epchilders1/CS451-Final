Anyone who has ever been adopted can relate to the myriad of emotions of meeting his or her birth parents and the film captures this well. While the film can be corny at times, it's not heavy handed nor does it proselytize on the abortion issue but rather presents a compelling and uplifting story of hope, redemption and sacrifice.",

Contrived ending which deviates from the original 'true' story by giving the fictional best friend a sister in the exact same dilemma as the main characters birth mother. Avoid if you didn't already realise this that an anti abortion propaganda film (based on a true story - which I'd guess is better than this film)",

The kind of ending that, I expect, anyone who finds themselves needing to give their child up for adoption would hope for. So, in that sense, it's very heartwarming however,  we all know that this candy floss happiness is not what everyone gets.\nAs a pro-choice agnostic this film was too heavy on religion for me, God was mentioned a lot and was constantly thanked throughout the film. Abortion was shown to *only* be taking a life and a cold, thoughtless end to an unwanted pregnancy. And American clinical are shown to also be cold and uncaring.\nUltimately, although I was happy that this film told a true story of a happy life that adoption provided for this person, I was left feeling preached to during this movie. I expect that anyone who is religious and pro-life will love it.\nAlso the colour coded mothers really bugged me.",
