NOTHING NEW WAS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE BY THIS MOVIE TO THE WHOLE IDEA. MEGAN FOX REALLY SEEM LIKE A ROBOT, SHE PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL",

Certains classiques ind\u00e9modables restent dans les hauts du podium comme certains Terminator, d'autres sont sympathiques comme les M3gan, et d'autres sont carr\u00e9ment nul comme Subservience.\n\nJe n'irais pas jusqu'\u00e0 dire que c'est un navet, mais le film est franchement ennuyant, j'ai l'impression que le film a \u00e9tait cr\u00e9er juste pour justifier quelque pseudo sc\u00e8ne \u00e9rotique avec Megan Fox qui dans ce film \u00e9tait toute en beaut\u00e9. Autant faire un film porno \u00e7a aurait mieux march\u00e9, je pense.",

    "text": "Subservience (2024): A Glitch in the Matrix... and in Logic\n1.5/5 stars (generously)\n\n\"Subservience\" is what happens when you mix a GPS error with ChatGPT on a bender. It starts with stock footage of Anchorage, Alaska, tosses in a bunch of Colorado license plates, and films the whole mess in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2014as if hoping no one would notice. Spoiler: we noticed.\n\nMegan Fox stars as a homicidal AI sexbot who\u2019s somehow downloaded enough malware to wipe out humanity, yet can\u2019t figure out how to shut a door without dramatic flair. She vamps her way through the movie planting computer viruses and spouting vaguely ominous tech jargon, all while surrounded by a cast of actors you\u2019ve never seen before\u2014and probably won\u2019t see again.\n\nThe plot has less depth than a TikTok comment section, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by an algorithm trained on rejected Black Mirror scripts. It tries really hard to be edgy, but ends up about as threatening as a Roomba with a grudge.\n\nIn short: \"Subservience\" is the cinematic equivalent of asking Alexa to write a movie\u2014and then regretting it immediately.",

    "text": "La trama suena un poco trillada a esta altura pero la maneja muy bien y logra cumplir en mas de un sentido. Arranca bien pero uno puede ver como va cayendo a medida que avanza (y se vuelve en la predecible robot asesina que b\u00e1sicamente la mayor\u00eda vinimos a ver) pero logra disimular bien esas cosas con varias sub tramas de personajes secundarios como por ejemplo la enfermedad de la esposa o como los robots van robando todos los empleos, bastante inteligente y bien llevado. Otra cosa que a mi me gusto (por OBVIAS razones) pero que a alguno le puede llegar a molestar es la hiper sexualizaci\u00f3n de la robota antagonista principal pero con la presencia de Megan Fox como que eso era inevitable. Hay varios momentos donde se nota que es una cinta de presupuesto modesto pero en ning\u00fan momento llega a caer en lo bizarro. En fin, esperaba menos y sorprendi\u00f3.",
