    "text": "\ud83c\udfac #ThrowbackReview: Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019)\n\nLet\u2019s be real \u2014 this movie was clearly made for kids, not adults or even teenagers. Releasing it in theaters as a major live-action reboot was a bold move, but honestly, kind of a misstep. While the film got plenty of positive reactions, there\u2019s been just as much negativity from adult audiences who felt it missed the mark.\n\n\ud83d\udc67 The tone? Completely childish.\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The casting? Off.\nThe actors were full-grown adults trying to play characters we associate with little kids \u2014 especially Dora and Diego \u2014 and it just didn\u2019t work. Diego didn\u2019t even feel like a real part of the film; more like an afterthought. The whole thing felt awkwardly assembled and overly hyped.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Now, did I hate it?\nNot at all.\n\nIt was charmingly creative and decent for what it was. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted to watch, or something I\u2019d go out of my way to see again \u2014 but it was creative enough to keep me engaged. It didn\u2019t wow me, but I didn\u2019t walk away annoyed either.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d So, did I love it? No.\n\ud83d\udc40 Did I like it? Sure.\nAt the end of the day, it was just a movie \u2014 one that didn\u2019t fully land for adults, but might still work for a younger crowd.",

    "text": "A fun movie to turn your brain off to. If you have grown up watching Dora and if you have a romance for nostalgia, this film could be for you. Please don't sit down for this with a critical mindset. The movie carries forward the spirit of the cartoon itself and is true to its roots in new, uncanny, and hilarious ways.  \n\nThe movie kicks off with Dora having to move to the city as her parents go on a dangerous quest. However, when her parents go off the radar, she is soon pulled back into the jungle and the intricacies of the expedition. Along the journey, friendships unfold and strengthen. The Dorasongs are so cosy. I probably will not rewatch this, but, this one watch has taken me back over 15 years.  \n\nI aDoraed Isabela Merced as Dora. Cole (Michael Pe\u00f1a) and Elena (Eva Longoria) were so amiable. I loved Randy, and Nicholas Coombe's absolutely lovable portrayal of the dude. Diego (Jeffrey Wahlberg) and Sammy (Madeleine Madden) were not very memorable, frankly. Boots was all the more aDorable than I remembered.  \n\nDora and the Lost City of Gold is dumb, wholesome and entertaining. The characters, the casting, the quirks\u2014all had the perfect amount of Doraness in them, and they blended really well.",

    "text": "See, this film gets it right. It knows dora as a franchise is ultra campy, so they have a lot of good, ironic dora-humour. Dora is great at a lot of stuff, but shes not live-action mulan. Her arc is great, but the side characters!!! They are os great. They are fleshed out, each with their own quirky personality and flaws. Also its just good fun. I highly reccomend.\n\nThat being said, its not perfect. The child acting is just alright and the cgi a bit disapointing.\n\nAnyway ye, plz watch this.",

It's a family film that's still pretty adventurous, with plenty of heart and some genuinely laugh-out-out gags that had me rolling.",

It's filled with callbacks and gags from the original show but never really feels like it treats you as a toddler.",

    "text": "Everyone in this movie constantly overacts. It feels like a bunch of individuals just saying their lines and trying to be as over the top as possible.  The only one in the movie who seems to actually be acting like they would in a normal movie is Jeff Wahlberg. Is that Mark Wahlberg's son? Weird that he would have a son that's the best actor in a movie? I might have liked this movie if I were 3-9 years old. Its yet again another modern movie that puts all its money into either big actors, or cgi and nothing into good script, or good acting or good directing, or good storytelling or good character development. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "When my sister was a little girl, she would often watch the original Dora the Explorer show which was cute but a little annoying. To know Paramount put money and time to make a live action version with a couple of decent performers sounded interesting so I decided to check this out.\n\nDora is an explorer of worldly adventures from Africa, South America, Asia and many more while being educated and watched over by her parents. But now her parents need her to live a normal life while they make discoveries on their own. Dora finds it tough as a sheltered girl in the pressure of being a teenager, but when her parents end up missing and ends up being taken hostage with several kids from school, she becomes involved in an adventure to find a discovery of a legendary treasure that many would kill for.\n\nThis was as annoying as I expected it to be, which is a shame because there are many talented performers including Isabella Merced who delivers an adorable performance as Dora the Explorer. But everything is a great waste, from talented actors to a poorly written story.",
