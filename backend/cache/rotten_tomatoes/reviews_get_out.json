Call me gruesome or f****d up but the fact that she did that to not only him but my other fellow dark skinned brothers I would have done the whole 9 yards all over her face. Great movie though just wouldve not left her to die in peace like that ngl.",

Jordan is good at taking a creepy little scare in your head and making it more psychologically scary. There were little comedy bits but it wasn\u2019t too much, they fit in perfectly.",

And the conclusion is worth each uncomfortable chuckle and moment of doubt. Ultimately Get Out can\u2019t help but ask the question: How would all these white people feel if they could walk in a black person\u2019s shoes for a day? And that\u2019s something worth considering.",

    "text": "Had high expectations. Definitely didn\u2019t exceed them, now to understand this movie you need a deep understanding of whats happening. SPOILER: In my opinion an innocent man that got basically manipulated into a psychopathic, seemingly normal family\u2019s house is a creepy concept. The acting was so good you felt it was infront of you. Now even for someone who had higher expectations on the movie, and was a little disappointed. This movie was creepy and had parts that freaks you out. But I didn\u2019t get a chance to experience what everyone else did. Definitely will be re-watching. A great 4 stars for quality as of now",

    "text": "I think this movie slightly exceeded my expectations. It's not that my expectations were low; in fact, they were high. But the synopsis I'd read didn't interest me that much, but it's highly rated so I decided to watch it. From the start, I liked the movie's music, especially the two opening songs. As for the acting and the characters, I found Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, as a likable, unpretentious, and composed individual, the sort of person who genuinely tries to avoid trouble and monitors his conduct. Also Rod, played by Lil Rel Howery, I immediately liked them, and he made me laugh a lot. He gave his character a lot of personality. Overall, I liked all the performances, but especially theirs. As for the plot, I found it to be more interesting than I expected. There were several surprises, things that at least weren't obvious or predictable to the point that I wasn't sure how the whole story would end. That said, sadly we\u2019re used to certain tragedies happening in real life, especially in the final sequence with Chris raising his hands. I\u2019m from Mexico and I feared something very different would happen than what actually did. I don\u2019t know how it took me so long to watch this movie.",

It\u2019s engaging from start to finish, smoothly balancing moments of humor, drama, and tension that keep you hooked throughout. The characters feel real, and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention without feeling rushed.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth watching if you enjoy this type of genre. The film is well-made, entertaining, and leaves a lasting impression. Even after it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll find yourself thinking about the story and the characters, making it a memorable experience.\n\n-flickswithmigs",
