So Tyler and Kassi staged Don's suicide but what happened to the woman that Don tried to suffocate but survived?   Did she not report it to the police and went along with the coverup? I seriously doubt that that's something a normal would do.  That part was never explained.",

    "text": "Starts off well but despite some great acting especially from Plummer this is let down by the screenplay which although subtle and avoiding genre cliches becomes totally unstuck, managing to both turn drearily predictable in details, and to stretch suspension of disbelief to unfortunate breaking point in story arc. It's a darn shame, this could have been a really great film.",

Dylan McDermott should get way more parts, always irritates me when hollywood doesn't throw more stuff at great actors. This is an easy addition to your collection.",

    "text": "Amazing film. Can't believe this flew under my radar for so many years. Lots of unexpected twists and faux climactic endings that had me really questioning many times where was it going. As far as the ending, I saw so many reviews raving about the movie until the real ending transpired, so I was wincing waiting for the big let down. NOT AT ALL! Spoiler Alert **** The ending was perfect. It has to be appreciated with context. This was a very tight knit and heavily religious community. If the dad were to be revealed as the Clovehitch killer, who was a pillar of the community, it would have traumatized the whole community for a generation. But importantly, it would have destroyed the son's mom and little sister. By staging his death as an accident/suicide, it spared everyone of this trauma. However, I will concede, this ending didn't bring any closure to the victims' families. But the son was looking out for his family and the community at large. It was a Faustian bargain, but I think it worked for the tone of the movie. Highly recommended.",

Every actor in the movie effectively conveyed their character's role, especially Dylan McDermott. I just think it isn't original and that is my only problem. It gives you that BTK type story again and that's why I gave it three stars.",
