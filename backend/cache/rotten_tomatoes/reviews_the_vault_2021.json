He looks like a stunned mullet at all times, thank God there were no sex scenes he was in ( or did I fall asleep?), I just can't imagine how ( un) realistic those would be with him staring straight ahead, blinkless, at all times. My goldfish would have been more entertaining.",

Worst is making engineers look dumb, this engineer solves 2 problems in the movie 1 how to get a pin #, 2 freeze a battery to trick a weight. The production value and actors sold the movie but wtf on writing is all i have to say.   ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS bring in rebreathers and sneek out, then locate the treasure somewhere clever i dono like an island with another map for a sequal... I can write a way better story line that actually makes sense. Im for sale and would glady do it just for the sake of humanity!",

If you're looking for something that is dumb entertainment, then this is it. Freddie Highmore (the main actor) was pretty hard to take seriously. His boyish mannerisms / face didn't scream lead actor to me. I just didn't care that he was involved. Nothing against him, I don't think action movies are his specialty.",

It's genre is \"serious caper;\" yet, it has enough humor it's not stodgy or dull.  I did NOT see nor was bothered by plot holes other critics complained of.  Crackerjack directing committed to characters often erases other distractions.",

    "text": "Nice actors, good soundtrack, but too many improbabilities and large plotholes.\nIt feels like the scriptwriters have outdone themselves with clever finds to create a \u2018mission impossible' style movie full of technical gadgetry and plot turns, but like actor Freddie Higmore remarks: sometimes you need to think simple. More is not always better. \nAt the start, the sound and filming is gripping. Further into the movie, if you're willing to overlook a huge amount of improbabilities in the setup, you're well enough entertained. But * spoiler alert * it is a bit much too ask of an audience that, even during a world cup football match, not one guard or policeman, forewarned, would notice three black-clad figures walking over white roofs\u2026 or that two of them, well captured on security camera, would be able to escape from Spain to France and not found by Europol.. also their own team follows them on scanners during the heist, but the sophisticated surveillance systems of the bank do not pick up the signals\u2026 nop, a slightly technical-savvy viewer will be slightly annoyed\u2026\n\nAll in all, entertaining, but not as good as it could have been and certainly no match for the Mission Impossible franchise.",
