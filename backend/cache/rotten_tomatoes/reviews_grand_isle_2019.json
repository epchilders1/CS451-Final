    "text": "I found this movie on DVD, and decided to give it a watch. The story was ok, and the acting similarly on par. It has a few surprises, and was scary enough to keep my interest, without giving me nightmares, so it was pitched about right for my taste in this genre. The main problem I found with the film was that most of the scenes take place indoors at night during the hurricane, which inevitably leads to poor lighting and difficulties seeing what is taking place on screen. I am not a fan of this approach to movie making, and I think many directors adopt it to save on the budget, under the guise of creating an atmosphere! That said, the film was no worse than many others in that regard, so I would rate it about average overall. It's worth a look if you stumble across it.",

    "text": "Well, what can I say?! It's mainly a three person psycho drama which tries to be a thriller, but never really makes it all the way there. There is a certain small of suspense without ever making it an actually tense flick. Though not boring, it has little to say, and completely ruins its mediocrity taking it down crap lane with the most idiotic and senseless of endings that one can or cannot imagine. 3 1/2 of 10 points. Without this moronic ending it could have nearly been a 5. What were the script writer and the director thinking??",

    "text": "Love Nic Cage...but...wow. This movie started out pretty strong for the first 20-30 minutes. It was gripping and intriguing. At about 40 minutes, it sputtered and peaked. It was too good to be true. From there it went straight downhill. It became a series of chaotic scenes culminating in a disappointing  and nonsensical ending. It's like the writers decided to wrap up the whole movie during their lunch break or something. Nicolas Cage and KaDee Strickland did a great job though, despite a poor dialogue and script.",

Cage is loose and wild as usual, nothing new.  Script is less than 50% believable and makes sense less than 50% of the time. A total bomb, an awful effort in film making.  Second half begins to make less and less sense until you just don't care anymore.",

I can't believe they couldn't be bothered to spend 3 minutes researching \"USMC Vietnam ERA Class A Uniform\".  It is disrespectful.  I realize Hollywood has no respect for the armed services, but they could at least attempt to be accurate.",

Still; the cast is compelling, (especially Benward), and it\u2019s a fun enough ride with Cage in tow. It\u2019s not as fun as Cage\u2019s other B-Film fare, and the execution is clumsy - but \u201cGrand Isle\u201d is far better than it should be, thanks to an overqualified cast.",

    "text": "More silly than anything else, _Grand Isle_ is Southern noir with a cartoonish script and a distinct lack of cleverness. Nicholas Cage doing a fakey southern accent is bad enough, but Kelsey Grammar doing it is just outright laughable. As to Kadee Strickland's accent, I don't know if she's from the south, but I highly doubt it.\nThe whole movie is underwhelming. Even the so-called category 3 hurricane is no big deal. \nThis is one of those amusing bad movies in which you know you're slumming. I lost count of the unintentional laughs. So just take it for what it is.",

The narrative unfolds via flashback interviews with a local detective (Kelsey Grammar unintentionally hilarious doing his best Tennessee Williams character). The Byzantine plot keeps trying to surprise, but the inevitable encounters are mostly predictable. Cage is acting like crazy (pun intended) and the others do fine. The direction manages to squeeze some mild tension here and there, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile.",

Fact is he's movie making machine and  the rolls and themes are usually superficial and not exactly great cinema.\nWhat was in the basement was a huge part of the story but not much time devoted on screen presumably since the camera had to stay on Cage mostly.  Cage is 57, the uniform fitting, the era denoted by the cars did not make any sense.  The hero's wife bailed out on him throughout the movie, wants to take it a day at a time at the end like water under the bridge and there's only one answer to that.  Take a hike. \nJust one of those deals where the movie is about something simple with not real thought to how the details mesh when it comes to the final cut.\nNo not a cinematic gem but pure Cage and entertaining.",
