    "text": "Film comes across corny, especially with the American boys one liners every 5 minutes. And the corny music. Acting isn't great. It's like the film is dubbed but it's not. The fighting seems like they're doing rehearsals. Every punch can be seen coming and both parties waiting to be hit likes its WWE wrestle mania. Other than that. The colour grade was okay. However the sound was so low I had to max out the volume to hear anything. The fast and furious ending is the icing on the cake of corny. \" to jenny \"",

And so...many...cliches!! \"I, the evil untrustworthy demonic figure will restore your dead family if only you betray all of humanity.  PSYCH!!!!\"   \n\nNot worth watching.",

However this film is a patchwork of choreographed martial art fight scenes with the flimsiest storyline trying to connect them. Terrible story, terrible script, waste of 90+ minutes. I think my 2* may be too generous.",

I do however expect, entertainment, of which I got null.\nThe acting, well was non-existing, the \"martial arts\", sub-par at best. If you are a fan of D-list actors or like sitting in a theater and reading a good book. This film was for you, if you were at home, hoped you remembered you could've changed the channel.",

The script could have used a bit more depth and dialogue. There's a sex scene in the movie so you may not want to watch it with your parents (awkward!). I highly recommend this movie.",

I recently watched this movie and to put it plainly, a NO JERKY ACTION SCENES experience.\n\nStarring Lewis tan, Fistful Of Vengeance lives up to the hype.\n\nFistful Of Vengeance is a Action movie about characters who embark on a journey of revenge. Despite the obstacles, big and small, the characters in the movie, as well as the viewers, still meet a great end. The performances from Lewis tan illustrate the narrative of this movie with such a viable effort. Consequently, this film ended up being an AMZING ACTION film",
