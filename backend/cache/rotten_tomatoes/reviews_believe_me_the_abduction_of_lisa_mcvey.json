    "text": "I loved this movie! I\u2019m a true crime fan and this movie captures the audiences attention and hooks you in with suspense. The actress who plays Lisa also plays Kara Robinson another similar movie to this (based on a true story) and she is a MARVELOUS actor! I really enjoyed the way the actual Lisa McVey talked about her experience at the end of the movie. It brings you back to life by reminding you this really happened to someone. All in all an amazing movie if you\u2019re a true crime fan I would definitely recommend !!",

    "text": "Lisa McVey (Katie Douglas) left a bad home situation with her mother to live in Tampa with her grandmother, but within a few weeks she was being abused by Morris, her grandmother's boyfriend, and then abducted by Bobby Joe Long. Even worse, her grandmother just assumed that she ran away and wasn't in any danger.\n\nBobby (Russif Sutherland, the half brother of Keifer) holds Lisa bound and blindfolded \u2014 much like the nine other women he'd already killed \u2014 continually assaulting her while she gains his trust by asking him about other women and then leaving behind as much evidence as she can, touching everything in his apartment and even pulling out her hair and hiding it all over the place. She also begins memorizing everything she can.\n\nFinally, when she escapes \u2014 pleading for her life when Bobby wants to shoot her in the head in the woods \u2014 Morris and her grandmother beat her for five hours before calling the police. Luckily, her case is assigned to Sergeant Larry Pinkerton (David James Elliot, who made your grandmother and aunts feel all tingly when he was on JAG), who is one of the few people who believes in her.\n\nAmazingly, this true story ends with McVey becoming a deputy sergeant in Sex Crimes, working to protect children from the terror that she survived. As for Bobby, he was arrested outside a movie theater and was executed in prison via lethal injection in 2019.\n\nAiring on Showcase in Canada and Lifetime in the U.S., this is a pretty frightening story even in TV movie format. I can't believe that McVey made it and was able to lead such a positive life after.",

    "text": "This movie was exceptionally emotional from the very beginning. It can be hard to watch at times. It covers such serious and important topics and does so in a way that left me breathless. \n\nThe fact that this film is based on actual events makes it even more chilling and dark to watch. Lisa McVey was portrayed as, honestly, a huge hero. She has such courage and is so brave, not to mention incredibly smart and strong. Believe Me shows the importance of believing victims of crimes; too often victims - especially those of rape - are not believed and because of it, sick criminals like Bobby Joe Long aren't caught soon enough, if at all. \n\nWhile I was watching this movie, it showed me ways of dealing with seriously dangerous and traumatic events as they are happening. It inspired me. As a victim of trauma, this amazing woman inspires me with how strong she is. There was hardly a minute where I wasn't crying my eyes out, and I cried in every emotion. \n\nThe cinematography, lighting, acting, script, cast... it was all brilliant. This is a must see. Hopefully this film can inspire more and more victims to speak up, and be believed.",
