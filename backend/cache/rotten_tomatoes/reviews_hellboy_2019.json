    "text": "Watched the first two Hellboy films and they made great family entertainment, sadly this cannot be said about the third film. The vulgar language, music tracks and bad choice of actors ruined this film completely, not to mention the actual storyline (if you can call it that) which did not make sense in the slightest as his father has died twice now. Bring the old cast back please.",

    "text": "It's apparently that most of the \"critics\" have never read a Hellboy comic, before attempting to critique a Hellboy movie. They think the original trilogy was better, because it was flashier. This movie felt FAR more like the comics, than the originals. Harbour did a fantastic job in his portrayal of the character, and his disheveled look is much more like the original character depiction. That said.... Where the movie struggles, is the plots. Not that they're bad. But, there are just TOO MANY going on at once. They could have picked 1 arc (or even 2 shorter ones) and made a fantastic movie out of it. This is a classic example of biting off more than you can chew, and not knowing your limitations. Overall, I definitely recommend watching it at least once, if you're a fan of the character. Because, if nothing else, it does him justice.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Es frustrante ver c\u00f3mo una franquicia con tanto potencial, con una mitolog\u00eda tan rica y un personaje tan carism\u00e1tico como Hellboy, acaba convertida en un batiburrillo sin alma. Esta versi\u00f3n de 2019 intenta ir por libre, desmarcarse de Del Toro y su estilo, pero en lugar de encontrar su propia voz, se pierde en un laberinto de sangre, ruido y decisiones mal tomadas.\n\nDesde el principio da la sensaci\u00f3n de que nadie sabe muy bien qu\u00e9 pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 haciendo. El guion es un l\u00edo: aparecen personajes sin apenas presentaci\u00f3n, las subtramas entran y salen sin peso, y lo peor es que todo avanza a trompicones, como si alguien hubiera mezclado varias ideas en la batidora y pulsado \"turbo\". Hay escenas que podr\u00edan tener fuerza, pero la falta de direcci\u00f3n clara y un montaje atropellado las deja en tierra de nadie.\n\nDavid Harbour hace lo que puede, y en ocasiones logra transmitir algo de ese Hellboy cansado del mundo, pero atrapado en un guion que no le da respiro ni profundidad. La pel\u00edcula cambia de tono constantemente: pasa del gore gratuito al chiste adolescente y luego al drama familiar sin que nada encaje de verdad. La sensaci\u00f3n general es la de estar viendo un tr\u00e1iler largo de algo que no termina de arrancar.\n\nVisualmente no est\u00e1 mal del todo: hay criaturas interesantes, alg\u00fan dise\u00f1o destacable, y la pel\u00edcula no escatima en efectos. Pero eso no basta si no sabes por qu\u00e9 est\u00e1n ah\u00ed, qu\u00e9 pintan en la historia o a d\u00f3nde llevan. Todo resulta superficial, como si se hubieran centrado m\u00e1s en hacer que \"pasen cosas\" que en contar algo con sentido.\n\nEn definitiva, un intento fallido de reinicio que no entiende al personaje ni su mundo. No es que no funcione porque sea diferente, sino porque est\u00e1 mal pensada desde la base. Y lo m\u00e1s triste es que, incluso siendo un desastre, por el simple hecho de ser Hellboy, uno intenta buscarle algo rescatable\u2026 aunque cueste mucho encontrarlo.\n\n(ENGLISH) It\u2019s frustrating to watch a franchise with so much potential, rich mythology, and a charismatic main character like Hellboy turn into such a soulless mess. This 2019 version tries to step away from Del Toro\u2019s legacy, but instead of finding its own voice, it gets lost in a whirlwind of blood, noise, and poor decisions.\n\nFrom the start, it feels like no one really knew what kind of movie they were making. The script is a disaster: characters show up with zero introduction, subplots come and go without weight, and everything stumbles forward as if several drafts were thrown in a blender and set to max speed. Some scenes could have worked, but the lack of clear direction and chaotic editing ruin any momentum.\n\nDavid Harbour does what he can and occasionally captures that world-weary Hellboy vibe, but the script gives him no room to breathe. The tone shifts constantly\u2014from gratuitous gore to teenage jokes to forced family drama\u2014without anything clicking into place. It feels like watching an extended trailer for something that never really starts.\n\nVisually, it has its moments. Some creature designs are cool, and it certainly doesn\u2019t hold back on effects. But that\u2019s meaningless if you don\u2019t know why they\u2019re there or what role they play. Everything feels shallow, like they focused more on making things \u201chappen\u201d than telling a coherent story.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a failed reboot that neither understands the character nor his world. It\u2019s not bad because it\u2019s different\u2014it\u2019s bad because it\u2019s poorly built from the ground up. And the saddest part? Even in the middle of this wreck, you still try to find something redeemable\u2026 just because it\u2019s Hellboy.",

    "text": "Really Bad. The dialouge is just jokes, puns, and the other half is plot expose dumps constantly every five minutes. The villian is really bad and belongs in a bad Harry Potter or Dracula Movie. Not a comic book movie taking place in the real world. Hellboy is alright at best and annoying at worst. The makeup isn't as well done as Pearlman's and he comes off sometimes as a whiny moody emo teen. God Lizz and Abe are sooo missed from the GDT ones. The new ones are so generic and forgettable. The cinematoography is so dark half the time you can barely see it, terrible CGI that's somehow even worse than the 2004 one at its worst, uninspired direction, and half the time it doens't even look like it belongs to the same movie. This looks like half the time it was asetically ripped out of Van Helsing or Sleepy Hollow. It doesn't match at all and than it's filled with dumb scenes as well and boring ones. The music is a mix of generic cinematic stuff and rock/metal that doesn't work together at all and clashes with the dark fantasy asetics. The editing isn't good and pacing is terrible. The major strikes on top of this is the terible special effects especially the CGI and just a stupid dumb plot that walks a fine line between almost being incoherent in the second half. It's so stupid. Again it feels like and looks like two seperate movies. A comic book action flick and a dark midevil fantasy which never works at all. It's truly amazing how everything and I mean EVERYTHING here is a step down. Even the humor which got a chuckle maybe twice lacks any charm. And the makeup is a big step down. Skip This and stick with the 00's duology. God this was horrible and really shows how much of an accomplishment the 00's ones were even though they had some flaws.",

    "text": "Honestly my favourite hellboy movie. Its fast paced, has tonnes of action, great fight scenes, and an interesting collective of characters. And unlike the original films, which I still love, isn't bogged down by romance plot lines. I go to my action movies to see violence and gore.\n\nThe two main downsides I had were Alice's accent sounded really unnatural, it's distracting. And the movie did feel bloated, despite the pace, a LOT happens in this movie, and most of it is exposition, which usually happens when a series expects a franchise. I do think the story could have been reined in a bit!",

The plot is true to how comic plots were written (things just happen and they don't always seem connected until the final battle). This doesn't translate the best to film and the final act seems a bit rushed but the original had the exact same issues. Overall this is a good film with gory additions.",

It's maybe not as endearing as the excellent original Hellboy or the immediate Golden Army sequel but it's still very enjoyable and the additional gore was a welcome switch up in my book. It's not as tonally consistent and is much gorier but then it is an 'R' and was clearly advertised as one so what's the problem everyone? I personally enjoyed this and found it truer to the dark source material. It's well worth a watch and in the absence of Pearlman, Harbour made a good Red. Much better than its made out to be.",
