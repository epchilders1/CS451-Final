    "text": "Utterly predictable in pretty much every aspect. Even the supposed twists feel shallow and forced. The acting is fine, I guess, though there\u2019s not much to work with. And then ending is absolutely atrocious. Without that ending, I might have said it was worth watching if you just want the feel-good and can shut off your brain. But if you can shut off your brain sufficiently to enjoy that finale, then I don\u2019t really have anything for you anyway.\n\nOh, and the music sucks, too.",

Great scenes of sordid London, sensitive treatment of the autistic boy and his mother, great scenes with the music therapist.",
