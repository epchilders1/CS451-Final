    "text": "I found the story line somewhat interesting, however, it was very cookie cutter.  The was the good person who made some bad choices and when that person wanted to change found that they were actually indebted to some evil sources. So, a typical run away from bad to a better lace thinking the past was behind but only to find the past locate her and come to claim what was thought to be his.  Confrontation between the good guy and bad guy\u2026..etc.  This is what made the movie rather boring.  Good actors and pleasing scenery does not a solid movie make.  It reminded me of a Hallmark movie and I think that says enough.",

Enjoyable for romanic hearts who love, love stories, people familiar with the story in history and audiences who like to see something pure and untainted being offered on tv.",

The characters are rigid, and you cannot feel any connection between them. There's a lot missing from this to make it a good movie. Even the songs didn't hit. The lyrics were clunky. Decent but meh",

Sure, some creative liberty was taken but the gist of the story of Ruth & Boaz comes across.  It's somewhat difficult to take an experience that is over 2000 years old from a completely different culture and modernize it without completely losing the relevance of the story.  I think the writers and actors did an amazing job bringing a modern look at a historical story.",

I felt the movie didn\u2019t capture the heart of what the scripture says. It should not have been called Ruth and Boaz maybe inspired by with and boaz but nothing like the real story or the hood version of Ruth and boaz told by the streets or something lol I would definitely not watch again. Was disappointed!",

    "text": "Very casual acting. No stakes or real conflict from Ruth or Boaz. I couldn\u2019t tell if Ruth liked Boaz and couldn\u2019t tell if Boaz really liked her either. The dialog was weak and didn\u2019t deal with the issues in a real human experience way. The relationships were not shown strong. No chemistry between Ruth and Boaz. It felt like a boundary was up from both sides. This is why as a viewer I felt nothing. Sure they all looked great. But that does nothing for my heart strings. It felt forced and rushed all the way through. I didn\u2019t feel like Ruth was in a real commitment to her boyfriend in the beginning or cared for Naomi. The way the screenwriter presented their relationship, didn\u2019t tell it. I was confused why Ruth went with Naomi because they didnt appear close enough for her to just go with her and let alone it didn\u2019t show at all that she wanted to care for her. The writer presented it like she just want to get out a bad music deal. It seem like producers were more focused on the looks of the actors to tell a visually pretty love story.",
