    "text": "Why's the IMDb score so low? Plankton: The Movie is one hell of an improvement from The Sandy Cheeks Movie, which really felt like it was directed by someone with a very poor understanding of the IP, with executive meddling exacerbating the problem. I guess it's likely angry SpongeBob fans who feel that, like most recent media in the franchise, this film\u2019s existence comes off as disrespectful to the late Stephen Hillenburg's wishes regarding spinoffs, but it turns out that, Nickelodeon's suspicious timing aside, his comments on spinoffs were taken out of context. To be fair, though, hasn't SpongeBob had a few Plankton-centric episodes? They weren't backdoor pilots but it was clear whom the protagonist was in these episodes. Either way, setting aside the controversies over whether or not Nickelodeon were actively exploiting the fact that the creator was unable to object to spinoffs due to being dead, Plankton: The Movie is quite fun and practically looks like Wrath of Khan next to Sandy's movie. Improvements? Animation that, while still feeling like it was done on a smaller budget than the mainline SpongeBob films, is much more vibrant and polished than Saving Bikini Bottom's. Anything involving Karen in particular can be, at its best, an absolute sight to behold. A story that feels like it belongs in this franchise rather than being like that other film, which was basically a crappy live-action sitcom that just happens to prominently feature SpongeBob characters in it. Our aforementioned absorbent friend not being an obnoxious dumbass and actually knowing how to read the room, rather than sobbing about first world problems like how he won't be able to watch crap from streaming services on demand. And none of that uncomfortable, fetishistic nonsense here. Yes, Plankton: The Movie is very much NOT Saving Bikini Bottom. True, its pacing can be very fast and the comedic timing isn't always the best but, even on its own merits, this is still a fun spinoff in its own right with good songs, enjoyable art shifts and a worthwhile character arc for Sheldon J. Plankton. I definitely enjoyed how the climax played out as a result. Let's just say that things don't go the same way they did in Despicable Me or Megamind. And even some life lessons about not taking your spouse for granted, best demonstrated during one particular moment in the climax. Just goes to show that this IP can still have good content, even after more than 25 years. Maybe Search for SquarePants might have a chance...though what little interest I have of seeing it on the big screen is mostly for the Ninja Turtles short preceding it because damn, Mutant Mayhem was really good, wasn't it?",

    "text": "I heard about this movie after the release for \u201cSaving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie\u201d. I was worried that it would not be good, because of The Sandy Cheeks Movie being mid, I saw the trailer for this movie a week before it came out, I gotta\u2019 say it was great. Then I saw the movie, Same results: great movie. I love the soundtrack, it was truly hilarious, no slow parts. Better than The Sandy Cheeks Movie, not as great as the first 3 installments. Still a great watch.\n\n8.5/10",

The transistor that Plankton pointed to controls voltage. It\u2019s a to-220. I know no one else will notice but I did. The other thing was SpongeBobs voice seemed different. Still fun.",

And I do remember when chum bucket was a rival with mr crabs restaurant in one episode, because Squidward brought his grandmother\u2019s secret recipe there. So it would\u2019ve been really dump for him to not appreciate what Karen had done for him at the beginning of the movie. There are so many plot holes!",
