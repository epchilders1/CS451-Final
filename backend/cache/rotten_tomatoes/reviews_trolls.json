I'm fascinated to know how this got greenlit with a $125M budget but it certainly wasn't wasted. While other movies like this crashed and burned the individual hairs and fibers being rendered made this a beautiful movie to look at and it was backed up by a fun and endearing plot.",

Something about hearing Anna Kendrick be so happy and overly optimistic while Justin Timberlake being overly, majorly sad and negative makes this movie so much better. Just that once scene of Branch tossing Poppy's ukulele into a fire makes me so happy",

    "text": "Here, a movie that goes out to the optimists who have an obsession of joy & brightly colours.\n\nI really love this movie from DreamWorks - it is really engaging to me with being colourful & full of hype songs that I enjoy/make me happy.\n\nThere are a few lessons that you have been taught, such as showing your soft spot when I see your true colours & that is why I love you. It also stops jealousy with the Bergens just wanting to hunt Trolls to buy them happiness when they helped them unleash the inner happiness in them. Then there is courage with Poppy wanting to not give up & take risks to save her people, she rules.\n\nBTW, I also think the acting was awesome as if the cast was having a great time.",

    "text": "Cons\n1. The reasons why the movie is horrible and doomed from the start is there is too much cringeworthy and cheesy dialogue, especially the controversial \u201c But that's crazy talk. Who wouldn't wanna be with you?\u201d dialogue from Chef, the most controversial and worst dialogues ever in a DreamWorks movie. Also there is one stupid line where Dinkles says \u201cOh Snap\u201d, another corny dialogue.\n2. Sometimes the movie can get way too boring, watching it over and over again with no total meaningless. Making it feel like this is DreamWorks\u2019s first and only animated film to date.\n3. The musical numbers serve no purpose no other than make the movie hit the 90-minute mark.\n4. Overall, this movie is the reason why The Boss Baby franchise was horrible, thankfully Captain Underpants was the first good movie after Kung Fu Panda 3.",

    "text": "'Trolls' is quite enjoyable, unexpectedly so. I admit that I didn't know much about it before watching, but I did know of the troll dolls - well, just the quintessential (?) pink-haired geezer tbh - growing up so I didn't think a movie about them would move the needle at all. In actuality, it's good, light fun and suitably amusing.\n\nThe film has a brisk pace to it and the (toe-tapping, I'm afraid) music is expertly chosen, all the tunes fit their respective scenes. You could argue there are a few too many songs, at least compared to the standard scenes, but I'm not even sure that's the case myself. The voice cast are also praiseworthy.\n\nAnna Kendrick is a smartly chosen lead, with Justin Timberlake, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Zooey Deschanel and Christine Baranski offering firm support. There are plenty of familiar voices behind those aforementioned actors too, including Russell Brand (eerily playing his future self?) and John Cleese.\n\nA pleasant surprise, this. I now wonder if they did as well as this with the two sequels, I plan to soon see.",
