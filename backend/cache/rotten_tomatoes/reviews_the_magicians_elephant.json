My whole family from my 5 year old to my 15 year old and my husband any myself saw it together and loved it. It was funny and silly and full of heart and was also serious at times with a great theme. We recommend it!",

    "text": "I suspect this was based on a well-enough written book, but the chronology was terrible, the narration was worse than superfluous, and it reeked of PC message-making. (I can only take so much overt lecturing by a whimsical know-it-all canned narrator.) Neither the characters nor their relationships with each other were in the least believable, and it couldn't have further belabored the theme of \"overcoming the impossible,\" to such an extent that it reduced it to trope status. The only thing saving it from being absolutely abysmal was the beauty of the animation, which nonetheless seemed to waver between realism and Looney Tunes.",

Rather than capturing the raw, complex beauty of the book, the movie slaps crappy animation and unfunny narration onto a simplified, boring plot, once again proving that children\u2019s content is becoming more low effort and soulless than ever.",

It isn't the best animated film or even the best on Netflix, but it is one that can be enjoyed by a family without any question. The voice cast is fine, the story is intriguing, but you must let go of the holes in the logic and the disjointed way the narrator comes and goes. Happy people will love this! Final Score: 7.3/10",

The annoying prince was the best part because his character and delivery were SO far removed from the rest of the movie that it only added to his zany comicality.",

    "text": "Don't feel bad that you didn't garner Pixar-level critical acclaim; you are one of the first Netflix animated films to come out after the beloved Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, which had only recently won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Virtually any animated film Netflix was going to release next was going to have to deal with the dreaded \"Tough Act to Follow\" YMMV trope. The Magician's Elephant is a fairly straightforward film with an unpretentious narrative, decent voice acting, a good message and passable animation. The main issue that the film has is that it's not the most memorable piece of Netflix animation and it plays its plot beats a bit too straight. It's a well-intentioned film and if I had read the book, I probably would like this film more but The Magician's Elephant, while endearing, just doesn't have the same depth as GDT's Pinocchio or the compelling character development of Klaus. I feel bad for those unfair comparisons since this was produced by a different studio whose crew were making the film without those masterpieces in mind but when Netflix has such gems as those, it makes the flaws of other films feel a lot more glaring in comparison. Entertaining but hardly worth hailing as a work of art to your friends/fellow animation fans.",

And of course, the person with no redeeming qualities in this movie just happens to be the king. Thankfully, we had a young noble and wise Countess to make up for him. Hard pass on what could have been a decent children's story.",
