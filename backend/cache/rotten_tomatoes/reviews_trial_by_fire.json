I like how it highlighted what days on dead row could feel like. I enjoyed the humility aspect through the eyes of \u201ccriminals\u201d. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in drama , real life or crime.",

    "text": "\u201cTrial by Fire\u201d recounts the harrowing true story of a man from a disadvantaged background who suffers the unimaginable loss of three children in a tragic fire. He is unjustly accused of deliberately setting the blaze that claimed their lives. Jack O\u2019Connell stars as Todd, a role that may not have been familiar to many, yet he delivers a powerful performance.\n\nThe director masterfully weaves together the film's narrative, steering clear of romantic clich\u00e9s and instead crafting a gripping thriller that keeps viewers emotionally invested in Todd's plight. Laura Dern portrays Elizabeth, who serves as a pen pal to the wrongly accused man, adding depth to the story.\n\nFrom the outset, the audience is aware of Todd's innocence, yet we witness the brutal reality of the judicial system as it subjects him to mistreatment and manipulation. The film exposes the corruption within the legal framework, highlighting how the district attorney resorts to unethical tactics, including bribery, to serve his own interests. This starkly illustrates a system that is rigged against those with fewer resources, leaving them without a fighting chance.\n\nUltimately, the film presents a chilling commentary on the state of justice in the United States, where the presumption of innocence has been replaced by a presumption of guilt, especially for those without financial means. Todd\u2019s fate, dictated by speculation and a lack of proper investigation, underscores the deep flaws in the system.\n\nThe poignant conclusion of Todd's journey and struggles leaves a lasting impression, particularly knowing that it is based on a true story. It\u2019s a powerful film that I wholeheartedly recommend for its compelling narrative and emotional depth.",

I realized that other people don't live by them.    And that humans need to kill.  And that there are people so evil minded that they can't be contained.  But this movie makes me think I was right before.  On death row he yells that he wouldn't treat a dog like he's being treated.  \n\nHe was innocent and they couldn't get the Governer to read new evidence.",

However, an hour in all I can see is a left wing, do gooder moral tale of; the death penalty's is wrong. There is no drama, no real story, no suspense, it just plods slowly along to any eventual conclusion that is designed to convince you that the death penalty is wrong.\nThat's not entertaining that's propaganda.\nIf you want to be preached to and listen to a morality tale, fine. If you want drama, intrigue, drama, suspense, entertainment, an kind of story, pretty much anything that doesn't make you feel like an idiot, well, watch something else.",
