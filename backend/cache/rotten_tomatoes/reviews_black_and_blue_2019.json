Tyrese and Naomie had great chemistry and played off each other well. This movie was so much better than I thought it would be! If you like drama, suspense and thrills,  or if you just like damn good movies, I highly recommend! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

I thoroughly enjoyed the action, the story, and the message. I had a amazing time watching it, which is the whole point of watching a movie, to enjoy it.",

    "text": "This is such a poorly written movie being held together by nothing but convenience. Her phone battery conveniently goes flat and it's conveniently left on charge when gun fire sounds off so she leaves it behind. On top of that, she did two tours in Afghanistan, TWO but she has zero common sense? She kept trusting other cops despite seeing that THREE from her precinct were already crooked, it takes another three for her to realise that she shouldn't trust cops. She also never listens and never opens her mouth to say \"I have proof that it wasn't me, don't kill me\" until close to the end of the movie. It's hard to be interested in a movie and root for the main character when she has zero logic and doesn't use her brain. It also doesn't really tackle on the whole corrupt police thing at all. It's like a minor thing.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Este filme mistura a luta pelo trafico com gangs e policiais corruptos al\u00e9m tratar com racismo. Temos aqui uma nova policial Alicia que troca de turno para ajudar seu companheiro. Mas isso faz ela presenciar uma execu\u00e7\u00e3o de um sobrinho do chefe do trafico da regi\u00e3o. Os policiais corruptos que viram ela presenciar come\u00e7a uma ca\u00e7a atr\u00e1s dela e acabam mentindo para o traficante que foi ela que matou seu sobrinho. Por\u00e9m ela havia gravado tudo em sua c\u00e2mera port\u00e1til. Mas ela ca\u00e7ada pelos policiais e a gang de traficante, ela estaria morta se n\u00e3o fosse Milo, que trabalha em uma conveni\u00eancia. No inicio ele reluta mas acaba a judando e se envolvendo. E assim os 2 lutam. At\u00e9 que chega o final onde Alicia vai at\u00e9 o chef\u00e3o do trafico e quando a verdade \u00e9 revelada a policia invade o reduto deles. E acabam matando a quadrilha e na hora Terry o l\u00edder dos policias corrupto a encurrala, a policia descobre tamb\u00e9m a verdade. Um filme que faltou a profundidade. E Naomie n\u00e3o convenceu bem no papel, talvez se os papeis fossem invertidos com Tyrese desse mais certo. E pelo fato de Grillo no papel tamb\u00e9m faltou aquele cara das artes marciais tamb\u00e9m, acredito que daria outra din\u00e2mica ao filme.\nRoteiro e enredo j\u00e1 conhecido, poderiam ter trazido algo melhor.\nVale apena assistir? Se n\u00e3o tiver outra alternativa.\nNota: 5",

    "text": "It's pretty clear what's happening here with these reviews. This is more or less an updated Training Day. Well acted, decent cast, plenty of WTF moments where you really have to imagine what happens from one scene to another. In the end, the film is OK with a typical story in 2020. You can see how everyone one the whole \"blue lives matter\" front gave this 1 star, and everyone else gave it 5. The few unbiased reviews in between generally reflect a film that delivers exactly what you expect from a crooked cop / good cop situation. Could be a lot worse. I'd say watch it if you liked Training Day and see if it compares to that similar feeling of the whole world being a horrible place that they got right.",
