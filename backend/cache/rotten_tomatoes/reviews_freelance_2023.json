It has an underlying narrative that is important for people to understand yet is fun thrilling action packed and not boring at all. If I were to grade the movie in terms of all the movies I\u2019ve ever seen it would get a B- really impressed with it.",

    "text": "John Cena has to really carry the humor and the action. He's given some romantic moments that fall flat, unfortunately. Freelance is a very cheap and poorly made movie. It's way too long and boring, while feeling closer to a farce. Alison Brie is sometimes funny, but she's got no character. She is very hot in Freelance though. Juan Pablo Raba is playing a goofy dictator, but the movie comes across weirdly as pro-dictator. It's so off putting. Christian Slater feels lifeless and wasted. Alice Eve acts very poorly and is totally wasted too. Marton Csokas is pretty good here at least as the villain. \n\nNowhere near enough action in this poor Netflix action-comedy.",

    "text": "Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect much going into Freelance, but I ended up really enjoying it. It\u2019s not a big-budget blockbuster or anything, but that\u2019s part of its charm. The action was solid, there were some genuinely funny moments, and it had just enough drama to keep things interesting. John Cena and Alison Brie were a fun duo, and Juan Pablo Raba as the dictator was actually super entertaining.\n\nIt kinda reminded me of those old-school action-comedy movies from the \u201990s \u2014 a little over-the-top, a little ridiculous, but in the best way. If you\u2019re just looking for something fun to kick back and watch without overthinking it, this hits the spot.",

Full of awesome ongoing action, it worked for me and will become a movie I look forward to watching over and over for years to come. We can be saved if we fight for truth and justice. Thank you for lifting my spirits.",

Im surprised it has such a high rating.\n\nIts not a horrible movie by any means but it's probably one of the most forgettable movies iv ever watched, the movie has no original ideas and just repeats tropes done so many times over the years with nothing to make it stand out. The acting is okay, plot is basic and sort of boring...they try to add comedy in at times but nothing made me laugh out loud.\n\nIf you dont watch this your not missing out on anything but could be decent to pass time I guess.",
