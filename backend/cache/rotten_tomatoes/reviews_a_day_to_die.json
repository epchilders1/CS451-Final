    "text": "Not a Wes Miller success. Bland and very rushed to finish. Whole cast seems a bit dazed and confused as to what is expected from them. Vague storyline with lots of holes, millions of bullets disappearing in the ether, oh you know, regular low budget Hollywood jargon. Not really anything that stands out, even cinematography is sub par and looks like visual effects were done on my first IBM XT computer. A farrago",

Kevin 'Sorry I thought you were the other one' Dillon is the lead here, and for people who have. Little common sense on here will already know that Willis isn't predominant in this film, and due to his health issues, nothing more will be said in this review about him.\n\nBut it was fantastic to see Leon in this as the bad guy, channelling his performance in Cliffhanger to wonderful effect. And there's the always reliable Frank Grillo in it foe a few scenes to make the film feel a little more shines.\n\nBut it's use another mundane story somebody doing wrong to a crime lord ad having to pat them back in droves, or his pregnant wife will be killed, even though Leon tells people off for smoking around her.\n\nAdd a pound shop Davi's Schwimmer and you are left with a film that feels like 12 Rounds, but much longer.\n\nAnd the effects team must have dared each other, as there is some of the poorest green screen ever committed to film.\n\nSo it's not terrible, just terribly average...",

Tiene sus cositas: efectos claramente de bajo presupuesto, slow motion en las escenas de accion que jam\u00e1s entend\u00ed a que ven\u00edan, giros en la historia que no tienen ning\u00fan sentido.. sin embargo, y a pesar de eso, dentro de todo entretiene y termina siendo medianamente decente.",

From the terrible backgrounds out of the windows of the moving cars to people trying to kill each other suddenly becoming best friends, it just doesn\u2019t make sense!! The cast seems solid but 10 minutes in you realize you made a bad choice. I like Bruce Willis but this movie died hard.",

The lines were cheesy and illogical. The cinematography felt like a really talented high schooler (no joke). The plot is non sensical, and even the acting ... Kevin Dillon comes across like his character on entourage where he can't act to save his life. Except, he's actually really trying\n\nJust astounded at how bad this was",

The plot, acting, cheap action sequences that couldn't even be fixed with CGI. Probably another production with cheap money from that country which cannot be mentioned. The only positive is that it was filmed in the US, and hopefully the Mississippi community benefited somehow. Fun fact.... The director Wes Miller is also credited as \"C-Camera Operator\" in the credits. WTF.",

This was like a D- version of Heat alot of gun battles but stupid. I'm surprised the main actors didn't force the director to change some of the ridiculous gun battles.",
