Yet clearly all the cast are having fun, some of the jokes do land better than others. The arrow roulette scene did raise a laugh as did the joke about old televisions.\n\nOverall it was amiable with enough jokes which weren't tasteless to get by sure it's low brow humour but sometimes that's all you need.",
