    "text": "Disappointed. I usually love a good Ashton Kutcher Rom com and we haven't had one in a while. And who better for the female lead than Reese! However, we never get the two of them together through a majority of the movie. We see an opening scene where they romp and then a ton of split screen phone calls where there is no building of this supposed romance hiding within them. We get a little chemistry from Jesse and Reese and I was hoping this was going to be a scenario where Ashton and Reese discover they don't have feelings after all and she reconnects with Jesse but...no. There is this reunion at the end where we are supposed to feel something but feel nothing because we had no build up of this relationship. Great cast, horrible plot.",

    "text": "A storyline so loosely woven it doesn't even qualify as fabric. A screenplay so weak that characters struggle to make their connections clear to viewers. Background and legit character development...ppffft...we'll be having none of that! A missed opportunity for the cast (the one redeeming quality of this project), too bad this singular quality isn't enough to make this worth spending an hour and a half of your life's time. I'm shocked that this actually made it to the screen...an unfortunate error in judgement.",

From a one night hook up, we're meant to believe that these characters have built a life long friendship? Please. And suddenly, he's been in love with her the whole time? Ick. I don't know how this movie got made, but I could write a better script. Seriously. It's not good when you like the supporting characters more than the main characters. The gardener that meant nothing? Wtf? Not bagging the actors, cos I love them all (seriously, they are the only reason I watched this tripe) but this movie feels like a souless money making venture that failed abysmally",

    "text": "Despite every fiber in my being realizing this is nothing more than a sitcom-level rom com without a single original idea to add to the genre, I have to follow my heart and give this a lukewarm recommendation for one simple reason: I genuinely wanted these characters to end up together at the end. And I assume that's the ultimate goal of a movie like this. I'm not going to spend sentences justifying my opinion - I just gotta follow my heart. Surprisingly, what won me over was not Witherspoon, who can do movies like this in her sleep, but Kutcher. He's an actor who has never impressed me in the past, but I appreciated him here, particularly in his scenes with Witherspoon's son, well played by Kimmel. Supporting performances by Steve Zahn, Zoe Chao and Tig Notaro are humorous but feel more like gimmicks than people. And any rom com fan will guess every moment within the first 15 minutes. But Kutcher and Kimmel won me over. I can safely say I won't watch this again, but I don't regret watching it in the first place.",

The first is the lack of any chemistry between the two costars, the second is the kid who looks like a girl and we're supposed to believe he likes sports, and finally the absurd friends  that are the support group for these dysfunctional immature idiots. \n\nI end now because I just wasted an hour and a half of my life and do not want to waste any more time.",

    "text": "Your Place or Mine is a throwback to old rom-coms we used to enjoy starring some actors we used to enjoy. However, the filmmakers don't really try anything new or interesting. Like a run-down ride at a carnival, this movie chugs along the same track we've been on many times before, but it's not quite as fun as it once was. There's no real reason for the two leads to not be together, other than the invisible barrier the writers invented. And, much like the rickety amusement park attraction, Your Place or Mine comes to jerky, abrupt end, leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied and slightly annoyed.",
