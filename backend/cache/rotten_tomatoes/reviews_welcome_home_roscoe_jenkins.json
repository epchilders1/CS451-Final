    "text": "Story/Screenplay: (3.5/5) A comedy about a successful guy who goes back home and finds out his extended family still sees him as the kid who couldn't win at anything.  I've seen this story line before.  Not original.  However, it could still be really funny at times.\n\nDuration/Tempo: (3/5) At 1 hour and 54 minutes, it's a longer than average movie that felt about the same.  Might have benefited from less content to shorten it up a bit.\n\nCast & Crew: (3.5/5) Decent cast.  Martin Lawrence and Nicole Ari Parker stood out, but Michael Clarke Duncan was fun to watch as well.\n\nSummary: (3/5) The story was OK as was the cast.  I could go up or down with this film, but in the end, a thumbs down.",

Martin Lawrence and James Earl Jones give good performances. The script has some funny moments but has a little slow in some moments. Malcolm D. Lee did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the humor and romance.",

    "text": "While not quite four star material, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is genuinely funny film, The plot is Doc Hollywood meets Sweet Home Alabama with a bit of Just Friends in their measure.\n\nMartin Lawrence's Roscoe Jenkins leaves his Southern country upbringing behind and becomes too big for his bridges after becoming  success, but a long weekend home bring him crashing down to earth and realising what is truly important life.\n\nThe film while has been done before mainly in a white setting is done to solid effect in an all African American setting. The cast is a joy and are clearly having fun and the cast include James Earl Jones and Michael Clarke Duncan are unfortunately wasted with limited screen time. Jones being the typical disapproving father, while Duncan is solid enough in the role of big brother. Joy Bryant as self-centred  fiancee is also solid, while Nicole Ari Parker is just the right side of pretty and fun as the one Lawrence's Jenkins is meant to be with.\n\nIn fact the best laugh comes from when Cedric the Entertainer comes on screen as he and Lawrence bring the best out of each other whether it's gambling on dice which ensues in a brawl or the final race where they out do each other in the screen mugging to enjoyable effect. The two on screen were clearly having fun.\n\nLuckily this film hits enough laugh out loud moments amongst the cringeworthy moments to give it passing marks a hugely enjoyable film.",

    "text": "Martin Lawrence, Cedric the Entertainer, Mike Epps. 15 years ago, these would have been three major incentives to place a movie on the must-watch list. Now, these names are just another reminder of how the quality of black comedies have declined since the 90s. Gone are the days of 'Friday' or even 'Big Momma's House'.\n\n'Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins' is a mess of clich\u00e9s, stereotypes and poor slapstick humour, with even the dreaded fart jokes making an appearance. Lawrence & co put minimal effort into pulling off the same shocked facial expressions and over-the-top reactions over and over again, expecting to eventually force a laugh. Mo'Nique's loud and inconsiderate comments are the only occasional source of decent comedy, but it is not good enough to overshadow the severe lack of it everywhere else. \n\nDon't come here looking for a good comedy cause you won't find one. Admittedly, it is easy on the brain and so conveniently serves as something to have on in the background at a family/friend gathering. In truth though, this is probably because no one is really watching the TV at these events and therefore it doesn't matter what is on.",
