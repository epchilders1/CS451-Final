I think it'll take a special type of person to appreciate it. Give it a chance and I think you'll enjoy the ride.",

I happen to accidentally  see \"Jules\" and I felt something unusual while watching it. It felt original.\nIt was an original, it was funny, sad, quizzical, scary, hilarious, just so unique. The actors were great, very special each of them in their own way.\nI went back that week and watched it 2 more times.\nIt told story and you left with a lesson learned.\nSome might say it's  just a version of others, but I loved it.",

How calmly the characters handled catastrophic situations reminded my of House Boat or To kill a Mockingbird, both some of my favorites. I give this movie a five star rating, while I would give only one star to the Hollywood movies currently in the theaters. Marvel movies just kill my brain, whereas Jules soothes my spirit.",

    "text": "Jules is a tightly contained movie concerning aging, loneliness, and purpose and nails exactly what it\u2019s trying to be. Milton (Ben Kingsley) lives in the Western Pennsylvania town of Boonton (actually filmed in Boonton, NJ) and was living a life of concern for crosswalk and motto changes when a UFO crashes into his azaleas (he\u2019s very concerned about the azaleas). The alien (Jade Quon), who Sandy (Harriet Sansome Harris), an acquaintance of Milton\u2019s, names Jules, is a projection of each character\u2019s desires in their old age. Milton appreciates Jules\u2019 company and seems to derive enjoyment from feeding it apples, but if Jules were messy, reckless, or loud, I couldn\u2019t imagine Milton would put up with the riff-raff. Sandy, on the other hand, dresses Jules in shirts from her daughter, who isn\u2019t so much estranged, but just seems neglectful and preoccupied with her life out in Seattle. But despite its diminutive stature and plain, prepubescent features, Jules wields an uncanny power of the Scanners variety that it uses to full-effect sparingly. In fact, Jules was on the precipice of a DNF and landing itself on this list had it not shown restraint. What we do get is something touching and merciful. The climax and falling action are a mess and underwhelming given the possibilities of a UFO-featured movie, but the final scene will put a smile on your face just like Milton\u2019s. It\u2019s the beginning of a beautiful \u2014 and bizarre \u2014 friendship.",
