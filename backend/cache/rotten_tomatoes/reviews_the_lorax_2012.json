    "text": "Some of the most important movies in life.\n\nI would often have concerns about movies depicting environment issues because soon, it may become too late for what they are talking about. But this, it goes down in history & is a timeless one, teaching you & encouraging you to take your first steps of doing a thing.\n\nThis is also an allegory of the economy vs the environment because the Onceler cut down all the Truffula trees which was a habitat for the animals there for his buggering business. The Onceler is no longer the antagonist due to his regrets later - which is what governments & companies who cannot get round to doing things for the environment should be feeling.\n\nYou know who I think the real hero is? Audrey (portrayed by Taylor Swift). She was the one who wanted to see a real tree & masking on her face how upset she is about what happened to the environment.\n\nBut, there a few nonsensical parts: how can those humans survive while they go outside despite the O'Hare products? What has the chemicalized water got to do with the not-so fresh air? Maybe it is the invisible pollution.\n\nThis should go down in history for its songs, loveable characters & memes more than the \"Despicable Me\" franchise.\n\nThe word UNLESS is a powerful one.\n\nIllumination actually did matter. Its mt favourite movie of theirs & my favourite environmental movie.",

I thought they really brought the characters to life in a fun way. I think a lot of bad reviews came from people having a preconceived notion based upon the actors who voiced the characters, which is a shame.",
