I actually didn't think I was going to like it all that much, but this stupid film wormed its way into my heart and has become one of my all-time favorites. Wonderful acting, wonderful story, wonderful work. Great plot, really satisfying ending. This movie (ahem, Chris Pine, ahem) is very quotable. Really great.",

This one has a great cast, is produced well, and has an enjoyable story that ebbs and flows properly. The action and effects in this film are tons of fun, and it really holds true to a D&D tale.",

He said the writers and director understood the assignment. That D&D is supposed to be goofy and plans never go right and there are always weird adjustments and they nailed that in the movie. For me, I just thought it was fun with some quirky twists and turns and endearing characters. Chris Pine is so charismatic and charming and funny and yet still sympathetic. He is fantastic. Michelle Rodriguez is always great as a tough lady. The cast and performances are great. It's an good time.",

    "text": "The film nails the spirit of an actual D&D campaign: inventive set pieces, snappy banter, and unexpected comedic moments. However, the runtime stretched over two hours. Despite its humor, pacing issues and occasional over reliance on CGI effects, especially in creature-heavy scenes was hard to watch. And while nothing felt poorly executed, it wasn\u2019t exactly award material. Solid entertainment, but not groundbreaking cinema.",
