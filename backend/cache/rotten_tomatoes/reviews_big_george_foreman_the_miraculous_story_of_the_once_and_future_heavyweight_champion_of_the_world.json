I went to see it in the theater, because I had heard the story about how George Foreman had a vision of God and turned his life around, from Mr. Angry Man to committed comeback king, and he got happy in the process. I wasn't disappointed. Not every movie is going to be the greatest thing ever made, and it doesn't need to be.",

George Foreman is a boxer, preacher, and great human being. This movie gives you a glimpse of various stages in his life. It is a must see for boxing fans and fans of inspirational true stories.",

    "text": "This biographical sports drama tells the inspiring true story of George Foreman, who went from impoverished childhood, to Olympic gold medalist and World Heavyweight boxing champion.\n\nAfter a near death experience, George retires from the ring, finds faith, and becomes a preacher. Financial hardships force him back into the ring, where at age 45, he becomes the oldest heavyweight champion in boxing history.\n\nIn honor of the recent passing of George Forman on March 21, I definitely recommend giving this film a watch. I found it to be a very entertaining, heartfelt, and inspiring film. The cast was great, there\u2019s a fantastic message about what you can achieve with focus, determination, and perseverance. \n\nI also appreciated how it wasn\u2019t just a movie about boxing, but a story about the power of faith.",

If only all kids growing up in such dire circumstances could achieve even a fraction of what George was able to achieve. I thought the acting was very good. God is able to change anyone in any circumstance if they are willing to yield to Him.",

But that doesn't do justice to the real life story and the actors bringing George Foreman's story to life. There are many lessons to be learned from his life, not least of which is to always be kind but also to persevere no matter what the odds. I loved it.",
