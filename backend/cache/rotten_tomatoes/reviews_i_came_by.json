    "text": "(CASTELLANO) El planteamiento es interesante: un thriller brit\u00e1nico que arranca con una premisa social y pronto se adentra en un terreno m\u00e1s oscuro. Desde el inicio parece querer ser algo m\u00e1s que un simple entretenimiento, con gui\u00f1os a las tensiones de clase y a una juventud que busca rebelarse contra el poder establecido.\n\nEl problema es que la idea se queda a medio camino. La narraci\u00f3n cambia de punto de vista con frecuencia, lo que le da cierta imprevisibilidad, pero tambi\u00e9n hace que pierda fuerza y se diluya la tensi\u00f3n. En ocasiones parece m\u00e1s preocupada por abrir nuevas subtramas que por exprimir todo el potencial de la principal.\n\nHugh Bonneville es, sin duda, lo mejor de la pel\u00edcula. Su giro como figura amenazante resulta perturbador y le da la chispa que la historia necesita. A su lado, el resto del reparto cumple, aunque ninguno consigue dejar la misma huella.\n\nVisualmente est\u00e1 bien cuidada, con una atm\u00f3sfera gris y opresiva que encaja con el tono del relato. Sin embargo, falta un punto de contundencia para que el suspense cale de verdad. Da la sensaci\u00f3n de que siempre se queda a un paso de ir m\u00e1s lejos.\n\nEn conjunto, es un thriller entretenido, con momentos logrados y una buena idea de base, pero que no termina de despegar. Una propuesta correcta para pasar el rato, aunque dif\u00edcilmente dejar\u00e1 huella una vez acabe.\n\n(ENGLISH) The premise is intriguing: a British thriller that begins with a social angle and soon ventures into darker territory. From the start, it seems to want to be more than simple entertainment, with nods to class tensions and a rebellious youth pushing back against the establishment.\n\nThe problem is that the idea never fully takes shape. The narrative shifts perspectives often, which gives it some unpredictability, but also makes the tension weaken and disperse. At times it feels more concerned with opening new subplots than with exploring the potential of the main one.\n\nHugh Bonneville is, without doubt, the highlight. His turn as a menacing figure is disturbing and provides the spark the story needs. Around him, the rest of the cast does its job, though none leave the same impression.\n\nVisually, it\u2019s well put together, with a grey, oppressive atmosphere that suits the tone. Yet it lacks the punch for the suspense to truly resonate. It always feels one step away from going further.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s an entertaining thriller, with some effective moments and a solid idea at its core, but it never quite takes off. A decent way to pass the time, though unlikely to linger once the credits roll.",

    "text": "I Came By is a thriller like no other \u2014 a true masterpiece in modern suspense cinema. This isn\u2019t your average cat-and-mouse story; it\u2019s a haunting slow burn that grips you tighter with every scene until the final frame leaves you breathless.\n\nThe brilliance lies in the slow unravelling of the plot. What begins as a story about rebellious graffiti artists quickly spirals into something far darker, exposing corruption, privilege, and terrifying secrets hidden behind the fa\u00e7ade of respectability. The way the tension builds is almost unbearable, yet impossible to look away from.\n\nThe performances elevate the film into something extraordinary. Kelly Macdonald is out of this world, carrying so much emotion and quiet strength in every moment on screen. Hugh Bonneville as Hector Blake is chilling \u2014 his performance will forever change how you see him. The calm menace he projects is unforgettable. And then there is Percelle Ascott as the final hero, who delivers his role so beautifully and emotionally that you can\u2019t help but root for him, even as the stakes reach unimaginable heights.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a thriller \u2014 it\u2019s an experience. The atmosphere, the acting, the story, the way it all comes together \u2014 I Came By is one of those rare films that reminds you why cinema matters. A slow, deliberate masterpiece of dread and revelation.",

    "text": "Dear Director,\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge the ambition behind I Came By. The film opens with a gripping premise \u2014 bold, socially relevant, and visually intriguing. It immediately pulled me into a world that felt both urgent and raw, and I was genuinely excited to see where it would go. The rebellious tone, the underlying commentary on power and privilege, and the stylized aesthetic made the first half of the film feel promising and impactful.\n\nHowever, as the narrative progressed, I began to feel increasingly detached. The pacing became inconsistent, characters who seemed vital lost momentum or shifted without emotional payoff, and the plot took turns that felt more jarring than bold. The deeper themes that were introduced early on started to unravel, not through revelation, but through a sense of disconnection \u2014 like the story wasn't sure what it wanted to say anymore. And by the time the film reached its conclusion, I was left with more frustration than resolution. It wasn\u2019t the ambiguity that bothered me, but the lack of earned weight behind it.\n\nAs a viewer who was truly invested from the start, it's disappointing to walk away from a film feeling like its strongest ideas were left behind midway. I say this not to dismiss the creative risks taken, but to express the letdown of watching a story with such potential collapse under its own ambition. I hope future projects can retain the same daring spirit, but with a tighter, more fulfilling narrative arc.",

    "text": "I Came By, a thriller starring George MacKay, had an intriguing premise but ultimately fell flat in execution. It\u2019s a decent one-time watch, but not a film you\u2019ll find yourself eager to revisit. In fact, I attempted a second viewing and quickly remembered why it didn\u2019t leave a lasting impression the first time\u2014it simply lacks the momentum and engagement needed for a rewatch.\n\nGeorge MacKay delivers a solid performance with the material he\u2019s given. He\u2019s convincing in his role and brings intensity to the screen, but even his effort isn\u2019t enough to elevate the entire film. The writing feels uneven and lacks the punch that a thriller of this nature really needs to keep viewers on edge.\n\nThe biggest issue lies in the direction. It\u2019s difficult to understand how the film could make it through the production process without someone stepping in to rework or tighten the script. Thrillers rely heavily on pacing, tension, and payoff\u2014but this one struggles to connect those dots. As a viewer, you can\u2019t help but wonder why the creative team didn\u2019t pause to course-correct when the narrative started to lose steam.\n\nWhile I Came By has its moments and isn\u2019t a total misfire, it also never fully delivers on its potential. It\u2019s the kind of film you finish with a shrug\u2014passable, but not memorable. If you\u2019re browsing for something mildly suspenseful, it may do the trick once, but it\u2019s not the kind of thriller that lingers with you after the credits roll.",

    "text": "One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life, if not the worst. The idea is excellent and the actors' performances were as good as they were given. However, the movie is frustrating from start to finish. No reward mechanisms or development of reasoning. Like a feeling of always slipping towards the main point. Poorly developed plots, precarious characters in development. Untied ends all the time giving the feeling that it is an irritating and uncomfortable movie in the worst sense of the word: poorly directed! The movie focuses entirely on complex and annoying interactions to the real intention of the plot. Sounding more like an amateur movie with conflicts of interest in the direction. What could have been used for the good of the movie, was extended and delayed to the point of exhaustion, bringing an extremely frustrating ending in the sense of poorly developed. I would give it 2 stars, one for the theme and one for the acting, but it wouldn't be deserved considering that these 2 stars are sucked up by the incompatibility of functions in the script. I never did a review because I never thought it was necessary.  But the film was so negative in my opinion overall, that I sincerely hope it is removed from Netflix because it doesn't get more than 1/10 for both the genre and the purpose given from the beginning. Terrible in practically every aspect. Terrible.",

    "text": "While it follows a mystery/thriller trope we\u2019ve seen before plenty of times, it by no means makes it any less tense and anxiety inducing. Great performances all around by its cast makes this film a worthy watch. It has the energy of one of those films that you\u2019re just yelling at your tv dying to see the antagonist get what they deserve, wondering how people could get away with what it\u2019s shown for so long without rising any suspicion by those in authoritative positions. What\u2019s genuinely scary about this film is that things just like this happen every single day while we scratch our heads asking how was it possible they didn\u2019t get caught sooner with the evidence pointed straight towards all of us for all the world to see. Overall it\u2019s definitely a good watch during a late night weekend with friends or spouse; just don\u2019t go in thinking you\u2019re gonna see something completely new in the genre.",

Mainly Kelly Macdonald's character. She was great in this and her getting murdered kinda ruined the movie for me. Most of the movie she's trying so hard to find out what happened to her son and she's the main one you're rooting for, she's the sole person in that spot the way it's directed, but then she finds the same fate. But some people might find that to be a refreshing/more realistic take. Worth a watch!",
