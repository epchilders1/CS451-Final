From that moment, her character is no longer likeable and any love story to come is unbelievable. Who wrote this woman? Its also worth mentioning that after all these toxicity, they fell in love in 24hs. Thats all it took.",

Chock-full of stereotypes and cliches that are bound to make you roll your eyes and it somehow manages to only get worse. The female lead is unlikeable and downright evil, and the whole enemies-to-lovers trope here is over in the blink of an eye. If you want campy romance just go watch something else, there's better comfort rom-coms than this one",

    "text": "Loved it. I rarely agree with critics but am big on romance films that feel genuine. Critics think about structure and watch so many films how could they possibly FEEL anything? They are right, there isn\u2019t much conflict, it\u2019s cliche-ish, but that\u2019s the point of it. The chemistry & energy is palpable from jump. It was refreshing to see a film make love look easy. When you\u2019re with the right one, it\u2019s supposed to feel easy, especially in the beginning. It matched my weird.",

    "text": "Whilst not massively original, this movie is driven by its starring actors. Kat Graham is wonderful in the role of Julie and her facial expressions are brilliant, adding depth where the script may have been lacking. Both main characters are portrayed so well that you root for then and willingly forgive their poor behaviour.  I loved this film and have rewatched on Netfix about 5 times for the easy feel good factor. What really surprised me was that my 12 year old son has also watched it and thought it was funny. He is not a rom com person but really enjoyed the bickering and the food fight!\nDefinitely worth a watch if you want to laugh and cry and feel good when the credits role.",

This cinematic masterpiece combines the timeless tale of Romeo and Juliet with the lighthearted fun of a romantic comedy. Trust me when I say that I've watched it so many times that I know every single word by heart! The performances by Kat Graham and Tom Hopper as the main characters are absolutely magical, and the supporting cast brings it all together with their A-game.\n\nBut wait, it gets better! The movie is set against the backdrop of Verona, and the stunning views of the city are breathtaking. I mean, seriously, the film showcases all the fantastic places you can visit in Verona. From the fun and adventure to the comedy and chemistry between the characters, this movie has it all. And, of course, the storyline is simply amazing!\n\nIf you're anything like me, you'll be left wondering what happened to the characters after the credits rolled. Did they get married? Did they live happily ever after? There's only one thing I know for sure, and that's that Love in The Villa deserves a perfect 10 stars!",

The height difference was something I'm sure those involved in the casting argued about as well. Yes, some of the stunts that she did to him were over the top, but if you're looking for a Hallmark'esk' movie this will do just as well as the next one. All in all, worth the watch.",

Really bland, something to watch to pass the time, had its funny moments and decent acting for a low budget film. I'd watch if romantic comedies are your thing or if you want something on in the background that you dont really have to pay attention to. Comfort food for sure, would only watch once. Not going to be your go to love story.",

The chemistry between the main leads Tom Hopper and Kat Graham was non-existent, it's beyond cheesy and overall a big disappointment. Also, not sure who dressed the cast, but Kat Graham's outfits were awful! The European fashion is lovely and this was not it. Its almost like they were trying so hard to have a European fashion style, they ruined it and nothing elegant or classy about it. I love chick flicks and most usually have very predictable storylines as does this one. But the movie's biggest failure is the cast's pairing and lack of chemistry!",
