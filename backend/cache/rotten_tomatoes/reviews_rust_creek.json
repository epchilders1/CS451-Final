    "text": "Rust Creek (2018, now on Disney+)\n\nRust Creek is a thriller that I completely forgot about until I stumbled on it again\u2014but honestly, it\u2019s one of those films I end up loving every single time I watch it.\n\nWhat really works here is that it doesn\u2019t depend on A-list celebrity power to draw you in. Instead, it gives newer faces the spotlight, and they carry the story so well that you stay fully invested the entire time. I wasn\u2019t distracted by \u201cwho\u2019s in it,\u201d but instead locked into the story that was being told. The director did a phenomenal job captivating the audience, pulling us along this incredible, nerve-racking journey that this poor girl is forced to endure.\n\nI\u2019ve watched this movie multiple times, but I\u2019ll admit\u2014it\u2019s not the most popular or talked-about film out there, so as the years go on, I sometimes forget about it. But when I revisit it, I always ask myself: how can you forget something so great? Because it really is. It\u2019s thrilling, tense, and keeps you right on the edge of your seat the whole time, waiting to see whether or not she\u2019ll escape the men chasing her.\n\nTo give you an idea, it ranks right up there in my mind with movies like Losing Isaiah, An Eye for an Eye, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Enough, Jodie Foster\u2019s Flightplan (a movie I know a lot of people dismiss, but I consider incredible), and even Nell. Those are movies that might not be the first you think of when someone asks for a recommendation, but when you remember them, you realize they\u2019re absolutely incredible pieces of storytelling and performance. They might not be as loud as the biggest blockbusters, but they stick with you.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly where Rust Creek sits for me\u2014an underappreciated gem, but one that\u2019s executed with precision and intensity. It deserves to be remembered alongside those kinds of films.\n\nVerdict: Cinematic genius in its own right. A thriller that proves you don\u2019t need big names to deliver an unforgettable story. Very high marks from me.",

Cornfield did well not to overplay her role. The director paid attention to detail and the cinematography was spot on. I'm assuming this had a small budget in which case it's a top effort.",
