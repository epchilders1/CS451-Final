    "text": "A Flashy but Hollow Witcher Origin.\n\nThe Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a visually striking prequel that dazzles with animation but falters with a rushed, superficial narrative that skimps on lore's depth, turning a promising origin into flashy filler. Theo James\u2019s Vesemir has potential, but the script hurries his arc through repetitive monster hunts, leaving Lara Pulver\u2019s Tetra underdeveloped and the Conjunction a missed opportunity for cosmic wonder. What could have been a rich expansion of Witcher mythology devolves into a slog of generic fights and lore dumps, the 2021 style's fluid 2D action unable to mask the emotional flatness. The games' aesthetic nods please fans, but the pacing races past character beats, and the ending teases stakes without payoff, squandering a chance to forge a compelling bridge to the series.",

Creo que, de lo que vi al menos hasta ahora, de lo mejorcito que hicieron con la licencia.",

    "text": "I have no idea why everyone is giving this 5/5 stars. The action scenes sure were great and I like how gory it was. But the pacing and the general story made no sense! Each scene jumped around, providing little context. So you didn't feel connected to any of the characters, 90% of the time you're just confused on what's even happening. Like who wrote this? Honestly this was just a money grab. It's like watching a shitty action movie with the rock but in animation.  Definitely don't waste your time, all the reviews are scams. Just watch the fight scenes on YouTube. Rest of the film is straight trash.",

    "text": "If you're a fan of The Witcher series, this film is a great addition to that storyline. It takes place some years before the events of the live action series and has a direct tie-in (which I won't mention here, to avoid spoilers). This film is animated, and it is just as graphic and exciting as The Witcher. More than monsters and magic\u2014it also wrestles with the ethics of the Witchers' very existence.",

    "text": "Totally surprised. Impeccable animation quality, it's amazing how the Japanese traits give such a sophisticated aesthetic to the productions. The story has significant changes, but what was told told well. As much as events occur quickly, the script is well written. The text is very serious and brutal from start to finish, but it also has its moments of humor, which by the way are well placed. The characters are interesting and their motivations understandable within that universe. Highlight for Vesemir, the key turn of his mentality is very well crafted and he has enormous charisma. I really like this difference in personality between him and Geralt in \"youth\". The brutality and gore of the animation, in addition to being necessary, perfectly matches the essence of the work, making it even more reliable. The fights are spectacular and dynamic and the carnage is visceral. It is a canonical production with references and Easter eggs that complement the series and make the new viewer even more curious and enchanted by this rich universe.",
