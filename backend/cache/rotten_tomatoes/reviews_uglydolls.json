I think some people have forgotten the innocence of childhood and are harshly judging movies like this which is very unfortunate. It is hard to find children's movies free of scary events that are difficult for toddlers to comprehend. What is the point if kids aren't having fun? I love the songs and the graphics. We laughed together throughout.",

    "text": "The Songs are good and heartfelt & the Vocal & song performances of Kelly Clarkson, Pitbull, and Blake Sheldon, are very nice, but that's the only reason to watch the movie, other than that a Less Than Moderately Bad and Shallow movie; because it's Derivative of Toy Story 3, Trolls, and The LEGO Movie, and executed poorly and soullessly... sometimes there is a heartfelt and sentimental moment that is somewhat relatable and a feel-good vibe to it, but that's not enough to somewhat pass the time... I was mildly Apathetic and sort of bored of the rest of the movie, I only felt happy-good for the songs and musical numbers... 4/10",
