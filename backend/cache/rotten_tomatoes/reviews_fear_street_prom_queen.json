    "text": "This movie was great. I honestly have no idea how anyone thought this movie was bad. This is a perfect love letter to old slasher films in all of its cheesy glory. From the intentionally old cameras for the 80s feel the outfits and music. Its all from that time period it even has this classic dark synthwave music for the intense parts. I throughly enjoyed this movie way more than the original fear streets since those were like a glorified goosebumps story with monsters coming to life in a scooby doo sense. This movie while predictable would have had so much higher ratings if 1. It wasnt tied to the original fear street brand. 2. If it had encapsulated the genre comedy as that one guy says wowzers as his arm was getting cut off it made me laugh  3. If it released in the 80s when cliches were more norm and not considered overdone. Even if they were overdone cliches its more the execution of the story and the execution here is spectacular. Or 4. Seen as a loveletter to this time period of movies.\nIt even continues past the point where you expect it to be over in true classic horror fashion.",

    "text": "Too many people are mad about this film. Is it great? No. Is it acceptable? Absolutely. The story isn't tied to the previous trilogy, but to be fair, it never purported to be. The formula is familiar, so don't expect a lot of surprises, but the reveal certainly isn't the worst I've seen in slasher films.",

    "text": "Based on the 1992 novel The Prom Queen from R. L. Stine\u2019s Fear Street series, this slasher serves as the fourth installment in the Fear Street film franchise. Set in 1988, it follows a masked killer who begins targeting the prom queen candidates of Shadyside High on the night of their senior dance.\n\nSadly, this entry feels like a major step down from the original trilogy. It fails to capture the mystery, tension, and emotional depth that made those films stand out. The characters are thinly written and difficult to care about, while the performances feel forced and unnatural, with clunky dialogue that drains any suspense. The story sticks so rigidly to familiar slasher clich\u00e9s that every twist can be seen coming from miles away. While the retro 80s soundtrack is acceptable, it is not enough to make the film memorable. The kills are gruesome, too obvious, and unimaginatively executed, lacking the creative flair that defined the previous films.",

    "text": "One of the WORST movies I\u2019ve ever seen in my life! Completely predictable, lost the thrill and the comedy behind the first 3 Fear Street movies on Netflix. A terrible plot line, no character development whatsoever, barely any comedy, terrible acting, and terrible storyline overall. This really feels like Netflix just wanted to make a buck and turn a movie around quickly. Also, Ariana Greenblatt was one of the most famous actresses in that entire sad movie and her character had 0 role through it all. A missed opportunity. \n\nI am serious when I say I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen a WORSE movie\u2026. Not worth your time. So bad that I would consider cancelling my Netflix subscription. They had such an opportunity to continue a hot streak from some decent / good movies with the first 3 Fear Streets that had better storylines, were funny, and entertaining. But dang, you guys missed the mark.\n\nI also think this is the first movie review I\u2019ve ever written. And I\u2019m just writing this because that was without a doubt probably the WORST movie I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Terrible, awful. Do not waste your time.",

    "text": "As mortes... Tem 12 mortes no filme. Dentro dessas, pra mim, o filme s\u00f3 acerta em 5. A morte do Bobby (namorado da Linda), a morte da Melissa (talvez a \u00fanica personagem que eu me importo, junto com a Megan Rogers, a melhor amiga de Lori), a morte do Tyler (interesse amoroso de Lori, a protagonista), e... Errei as contas. O filme s\u00f3 acerta nessas 3 mortes. A trilha sonora \u00e9 perfeita, eu fiquei dan\u00e7ando durante as m\u00fasicas, pena que \u00e9 um filme fraco, nem a trilha salva. Os personagens n\u00e3o t\u00eam desenvolvimento. O filme parece mais P\u00e2nico (s\u00f3 que p\u00e9ssimo), do que Rua do Medo. O meu objetivo em Rua do Medo N\u00c3O \u00c9 adivinhar os assassinos, mas sim admirar as mortes, tentar entender as conex\u00f5es com Sarah Fier e os assassinos possu\u00eddos, coisa que eu n\u00e3o consigo nesse filme, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o tem NENHUMA conex\u00e3o com a trilogia original al\u00e9m de apenas DUAS MEN\u00c7\u00d5ES ao Acampamento Nightwing completamente CURTAS e esquec\u00edveis. Os assassinos s\u00e3o FRAQU\u00cdSSIMOS. Eu quero adivinhar quem s\u00e3o os assassinos na franquia P\u00c2NICO, e n\u00e3o na franquia Rua do Medo. N\u00e3o me divirto, acho muito chato. \u00c9 um filme com mortes feitas com CGI horr\u00edvel, sendo que em filmes mais antigos, como em P\u00e2nico, de 1996, a morte da Casey \u00e9 INCR\u00cdVEL! E FOI FEITA COM EFEITO PR\u00c1TICO. Tem uma morte ID\u00caNTICA a essa em Rainha do Baile, mas \u00e9 HORR\u00cdVEL. O CGI \u00e9 TOSCO, \u00e9 uma droga. Durante as mortes, os personagens que morrem (tirando uma ou duas mortes fora de tela, Melissa, Judd e Tyler, que s\u00e3o pegos de surpresa, e Bobby, Claire (garota f\u00e3 da Tiffany) e Gerald (Garoto f\u00e3 da Tiffany), que gritaram pra caramba nas mortes deles), eles NEM GRITAM DE DOR. \u00c9 MUITO RUIM! Eu n\u00e3o considero isso um filme de Rua do Medo. Pra mim \u00e9 uma par\u00f3dia MUITO mal feita de P\u00e2nico. Filme chato, irritante. D\u00e1 vontade de apagar todas as mem\u00f3rias. A protagonista n\u00e3o faz nada pra ser rainha do baile (que \u00e9 o tema principal do filme). Tiffany parece s\u00f3 mais uma valentona do col\u00e9gio (mesmo que ela seja, por tr\u00e1s ela \u00e9 uma assassina!). \u00c9 um filme que se desconecta da franquia Rua do Medo, e que parece ter medo de ser considerado Slasher.",

    "text": "The movie itself was great, but it does't go well with the universe. It just seems they did it to keep the franchise but it creates a lot of plotholes for the other movies. For example, in the first movie, we learn that the mall murders were the first one in 30 years, which doesn't work with the prom kills. And a lot of things like that. But it was still fun to watch",

The plot, some of the acting, the writing, just all not very good. There is 1 kill that was gory and actually was pretty good but that was about it. The whole story though was not great, disappointed after enjoying the original trilogy",

Endlessly obnoxious gore because they couldn't think of anything else to show us. I found myself laughing many times.. not because of a funny joke, but because everything was just so random. It was like a child wrote the script.. The only reason I'm giving it one star is it at least had a good soundtrack. So my credit goes to 80s music being good. The score itself was ill used. Having this spooky techno score during prom dress shopping and family moments was just weird.. Genuinely everything about this movie is odd. You can guess who the killer is pretty much immediately. None of it was thought out. But it's at least bad entertainment, I'll give it that. Still, very disappointing given the first films in the franchise were actually solid.",

It has virtually no connection to the previous trilogy apart from murders being in acted to teenagers, who are so unpleasant you wished the whole cast of characters would get slaughtered by the halfway mark so a new story could start.",
