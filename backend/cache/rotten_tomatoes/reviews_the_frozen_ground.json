    "text": "I would say that this movie is as close to a 5 star movie you can get, without it actually being a 5 star movie. It really keeps you focused on what is happening and the cast does a great job. People want to knock it for not having enough action or character development, but it is based on a true story. You can add a lot things that didn\u2019t happen and keep it close to what happened. I guess people wanted there to be more action like car chances or explosions, you know, the things that really bad movies need to entertain people. The ending when Cage\u2019s character antagonizes Cusack\u2019s charter into admitting he is the killer is great, some of the best work by both actors. Add in the amazing scenes from the Alaska wilderness and how the movie was shot with a cold, overcast feeling and you simply have a great movie. I honestly think that most people like to hate on this movie since both Cage and Cusack have had some real stinkers in their careers, almost to the point that they have become a cliche (especially when it comes to Cage\u2019s movies). Since this movie, Cage has done probably his best work ever. I think this movie is what actually turned his career around.",

    "text": "This movie had a ton of potential. It\u2019s a gripping and devastatingly horrible true story, and the Alaskan setting makes it that much more chilling (no pun intended). Sadly, this movie falls flat. Poor storytelling, poor pacing, and above all, poor acting. \n\nNicholas Cage was okay, not his worst performance ever but nothing special. Cusack was semi-engaging yet cliche and predictable as the killer. I think he could have shined had he been given better counterparts and a better script. Vanessa Hudgens was a complete disaster\u2026 she ruined the movie for me. She had a terrible fake \u201cghetto accent\u201d that she would turn on and off randomly throughout the film. She didn\u2019t sell the part at all; everything about her acting was terrible. Breaking Bad\u2019s Dean Norris was the only one who delivered a believable performance, and his role was small. \n\nFor a thriller, the movie dragged in places. It lacked suspense, which is surprising given the source material. The \u201cgotcha\u201d moment where Cage/Hudgens catch the killer offered very little emotional payoff. The whole film leaves a lot to be desired. Such a shame because, as I said, there was a lot of potential and it was wasted on a subpar film.",

    "text": "Care for a fast-paced thriller that works for what it tries to deliver? The Frozen Ground is a good choice.\n\nIn this story, Alaska State Trooper Sgt. Jack Halcombe is about to retire from his duty within 2 weeks, but the discovery of a body in the wilderness might reveal a serial killer on the loose. Now Jack wants to find the killer before he gets another victm, but also he has to deal with his marriage that seems to be breaking apart.\n\nEntertaining as this movie is, we can't ignore a few facts. First, the cinematography is frantic, to say the least. I even joked during the movie that I could not count one shot that lasted over 15 secods. Cuts everywhere, this movie is on 'roids, speeding through event after event until we get to the climax.\n\nThis is not a detective story, though it might feel like it. We know who is the serial killer from the start, and what we watch is Nick Cage racing to frame John Cusack for his deeds, all while relying on one traumatized victim that Vanessa Hudgens plays.\n\nThe Frozen Ground is based on the real acts of serial killer Robert Hansen, and the story tries to be as fateful as possible with the addition of some spicy drama.\n\nFrenetic plot points aside, Jack Halcombe's marriage problems are just dismissible backdrop that seems unrelated to everything we see. We could cut that subplot and the story would be the same; felt formulaic.\n\nOverall, The Frozen Ground entertains for what it is, and the tribute it tries to pay works. If you want to see solid John Cusack acting, this is one good entry. If you want to see a good movie, this is also a good try. Lacks outstandingness, but entertains enough.",

This is an excellent film based on the real life story of serial killer Robert Hansen. Great acting performances by the entire cast (especially the main characters played by Nicholas Cage; John Cusack and Vanessa Hudgens). It\u2019s a thrilling ride that keeps you engrossed in the story throughout the entire film!",

I lived in Palmer and drove the road to work everyday where he dumped the bodies and went to the river alot where he did as well. I feel so mad for those girls, but I didn't even know as much as I do now when I lived there. So erie to think I was on the beach of the same river alot with my family where he brought these girls to murder them.",
