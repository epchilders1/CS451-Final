    "text": "A humbling picture compositing stories to become its own respectfully giving this phenomenon wider recognition to those who favor a supposedly uplifting sports story. It actually ditches the formulaic tendency of predictability, despite the element getting forgone amid captivation, and focuses on the meaningful, humane impact between unsung skills and demonstrates how the physically strategic outlet not only inspires but also unites, alongside the sense of hope. It may not score as high, even when such is irrelevant, it\u2019s a feel-good film that minimally cheers. (B)",

It has a heart-warming story with a great plot.\nStarring actors like Bill Nighy and Michael Ward, The Beautiful Game is\ninspired by the real Homeless World Cup, played annually.\nOne of the main ideas for creating this film was to bring awareness to people\nabout the hard work people put in to organise events like this.\nPlot Summary and Film Effects\nThe film is about an ex-football player who couldn\u2019t fulfil his dreams called Vinny. Vinny is a\nhomeless man that lives in his car. One day, he walks by a team\u2019s football training and starts to play\nvery well after stealing the ball. Mal, who is the coach of the English homeless World Cup team\nnotices him and invites him to play with his team in Rome. At first Vinny refuses to go after seeing\nhow bad the others are. But in the end, after thinking it through he decides to go.\nThe first few days of the tournament he is not having a nice time and starts to get flashbacks of his\nyounger self playing. These flashbacks create an intense and suspenseful effect by flipping between\npast and present.\nOne of the clear cinematic aspects that you can\nsee is the high key lighting and eye level focus on\nthe actors. This makes it look and feel very\nrealistic and reminds viewers that this is inspired\nby the real homeless World Cup. This is balanced\nwith the quick shots of the football game time.\nThroughout the tournament, Vinny goes on a\nrollercoaster of emotions, struggling to interact\nwith his teammates and find his spot in the team.\nConclusion\nThe Beautiful Game is a great family movie. It\u2019s a heart-warming story about second chances and\nunknown heroes. It reminds us of the power of perseverance and teamwork. Plus, it has some\namazing goals in it!",

    "text": "What a wonderful movie, conflict is there and there\u2019s definitely some sad points, they make good points about how some people do need harm reduction measures in order to function, while also pointing out others do not but instead need mental health help. Unfortunately, in real life the NHS wait time for mental health help is very long. The actual story is fascinating and the acting done by the managers of each team is immaculate and emotional. Just because someone looks put together on the outside, does not mean they are on the inside and we all need a helping hand. I love football and this is a story of how sport and a team can help people become more than themselves. Wonderful, watch it!",

    "text": "I agree with the critics; a lot of warmth in this one. I'm a huge Bill Nighy fan; I doubt he's ever made a bad movie. But it's unusual to see him a little less acerbic than his usual self. And it's a rare role in which he doesn't wear a tie (even for a scene or two).\nCould have been a bit shorter and a few developments were fairly predictable but all in all I definitely enjoyed it.",

How can you not be moved by the story of the cup and how it has changed the lives of millions of homeless people? Sometimes we need to look past people's situations and see the value of each individual. Loved the movie .",

Not a sports fan, but the plot, actors and fact that this is based on a real organization that has helped 1,000,000 homeless people through a yearly football tournament is phenomenal.

It\u2019s not about football, but about human beings and their struggles and interactions. The movie tackles self awareness and the lack of it, jealousy, fear, courage, friendship, hope, amendments, and so on. I also liked very much to learn about this annual football tournament which I had never heard about.",
