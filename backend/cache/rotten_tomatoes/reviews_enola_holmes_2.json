    "text": "Bem, \u00e9 ineg\u00e1vel que a obra \u00e9 inferior a sua antecessora (Enola Holmes 1), mas possui seu valor. Os personagens do antigo filme foram, sim, desenvolvidos de forma razo\u00e1vel, al\u00e9m de trazer um bom enredo ambientado no na d\u00e9cada de 30 no sufr\u00e1gio feminino . Por\u00e9m, eis o motivo de n\u00e3o conceder 5 estrelas \u00e0 obra. Em minha opini\u00e3o n\u00e3o houve maior mudan\u00e7a na protagonista, o universo dela n\u00e3o se expandiu, ela ainda \u00e9 soluciona casos de modo muito repetitivo e tem a mesma maturidade do filme anterior, n\u00e3o evoluindo, ela \u00e9, fundamentalmente, a mesma Enola, im\u00f3vel no tempo. Entretanto como eu disse, o filme ainda \u00e9 bom.",

    "text": "I really liked the movie, especially for making reference to the struggles of the English workers of the period. It mixes romance, adventure and comedy in the right measure. The personal development of each character, comparing them, for example, to the first movie, all matured in a certain way. The plost twist of this incredibly interesting and extraordinary movie, when you start the movie, you would never imagine what would happen at the end.",

    "text": "Enola Holmes 2 builds on the charm and wit of the first film, offering a more mature and exciting mystery for Enola to solve. Millie Bobby Brown continues to shine in the lead role, balancing her character\u2019s cleverness, independence, and vulnerability with ease. The dynamic between her and Henry Cavill\u2019s Sherlock is even more engaging, and the new mystery brings more depth and suspense. While it may follow some familiar tropes, the film\u2019s fast pace, strong performances, and empowering message make it a highly enjoyable sequel.",

Plus Henry Cavill as the hot frosting on a solid theatrical cake...yummmm... If you enjoy period dramas, you will love this fun and lighthearted version!",

    "text": "This movie is not for me. I do not care for 4th wall breaking protagonists. Unless it is especially funny or charming, a 4th wall break simply takes me out of the story and ruins my emersion. I also don't care for movies that begin with action in the middle of the movie, only to freeze frame and cut back to the real beginning of the story. Unless the return to that scene gets completely recontextualized on the repeat, it just seems like a lazy way to start off with a hook.\n\nI likewise don't like it when the reveal of the story is obvious. I don't like it when the criminal behind it is introduced in such a way that they are clearly the culprit. I would say that this is a good mystery for real little kids, but the movie rocks a PG-13 rating, so the children that would be fooled are not watching the movie.\n\nI don't like it when supposedly smart characters make such stupid decisions when it comes to things that should be common sense. For example, the way the main character acts a crime scene. I don't like when characters I'm supposed to be rooting for are more unlikable than the villains. I don't like when a movie feels like it is preaching to me, they are a bit on the nose with how poorly women were treated back in those days. It communicates a fine message, but they hammer it in a little too much.\n\nSo yes, there is a LOT that I don't like in this movie. But on the positive side, the mystery isn't overly convoluted. One action leads to the next quite well. The movie doesn't waste too much of the audience's time, it is well paced. I like most of the main characters, it is just some of the side characters that get on my nerves. Cavil and Brown have good chemistry together and have more screen time together than the previous. And the final reveal isn't utter nonsense.\n\nI guess I am just a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes character, and am very particular about his portrayal. This one isn't awful, but if you're looking for a definitive Holmes mystery adventure, then this is just a red herring.",
