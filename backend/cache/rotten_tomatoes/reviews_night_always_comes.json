Love this 4 stars and great fighting fun along the way. Worth the watch",

Se plays such strong, feminine roles, like in Mission Impossible, where she is so empowered. She is a disempowered character here, but still so intense and strong. \n\nIf I had a sister as stupid as the role Jennifer Jason Leigh plays, I would have shot her. These stupid, mindless, entitled people. \n\nI would not normally watch a movie ir like this, but Vanessa Kirby actors the whole movie. Incredible, tight, acting. So impressive. She always amazes me.",

While its script stumbles with thin character logic and underdeveloped themes, the film sustains a gripping urgency through stark visuals and relentless pacing. It may not fully land its emotional punches, but Kirby ensures it remains a bleak, memorable ride.",

E aqui esta como a protagonista, como sempre estamos acostumados em filmes de a\u00e7\u00e3o, aqui achei meio estranho, em um drama. Em que ela faz v\u00e1rias loucuras pelo irm\u00e3o, pela m\u00e3e e pela casa, que esta prestes a perder se n\u00e3o levantar o dinheiro. E para isso ela \u00e9 capaz de fazer de tudo, prostituir, roubar um carro, roubar da sua amiga o cofre do amante, enganar, mentir e colocar a vida do seu irm\u00e3o em risco de vida. Para no final perceber que por tudo que ela lutou, n\u00e3o valeu de nada, pois n\u00e3o era o mesmo proposito de sua m\u00e3e e de seu irm\u00e3o, que pensou em leva-lo, por causa da m\u00e3e. MAs descobre que ela \u00e9 irm\u00e3 e quem \u00e9 a m\u00e3e? \u00c9 a m\u00e3e e n\u00e3o ela, que estava querendo assumir este lugar. E que seu irm\u00e3o tem esta consci\u00eancia, mesmo tendo down. No final n\u00e3o consegue comprar a casa, seu irm\u00e3o fica com a m\u00e3e que vai viver sua vida, simples assim, e ela esta livre. E m\u00e3e deu todos os sinais, quando comprou seu carro novo e foi embora com seu filho.\nVale apena assistir? Voc\u00ea ficou curioso? Ent\u00e3o assista.\nNota: 5",

Vanessa Kirby comes in with a strong performance, I'm happy to belatedly see her act as the front and centre of a film.\n\nThere is plenty of action across the 108mins, atmospherically the movie is spot on. It can get quite frustrating but seemingly by design, Doreen is particuarly infuriating - gaslighter of the century, that one! Bar Kirby, this also minimally has Randall Park, Julia Fox, Michael Kelly and Eli Roth.\n\nI will say some of the dialogue didn't quite do it for me, mainly for Kirby in fact. It just felt unnatural/ill-fitting to me here and there, but in fairness Kirby's acting prowess and the dramatic events are sturdy enough that I quickly forgot any issues I had with that. Worth noting, still.",
