The depth of the situation is communicated where you both understand and question each side. It's an intelligent, moving watch.",

    "text": "\"Passing,\" based on a 1929 novel by Nella Larsen is stylish, nuanced, and refreshingly smart. Unlike most films that spell everything out for you, \"Passing\" requires more of an audience. It allows you the freedom to interpret things in your own way. As a result, the film offers an experience unique to the individual viewer.\n\nIt essentially tells the story of two light-skinned African American women, Irene (Tessa Thompson) and Clare (Ruth Negga), childhood friends who meet by chance as adults. Clare is passing for White while Irene lives mostly as a Black person in Harlem (but passes when it is convenient). Clare, who yearns to reconnect with Irene, threatens Irene's carefully controlled life.\n\nBesides the obvious issue of passing for White, the film deals with questions about sexuality, how context plays into our perceptions of people, and how to discuss race with our children.\n\nBeautifully shot by. Eduard Grau in black & white in a traditional 1.33:1 ratio, it almost looks like we're watching a vintage film. The gifted actor Rebecca Hall, whose African American maternal grandfather, Norman Isaac Ewing actually passed for White (and Native American) in the early to mid-20th century, directs her feature film debut with a sure hand.\n\nA subtle film with an unhurried pace requires your full attention to fully appreciate.",

    "text": "Rebecca Hall's directorial debut is a powerful drama that brings Nella Larsen's 1929 novel of the same name to the screen. The film features Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga who star as two women in prohibition-era America who live vastly different lives and share a secret that could destroy everything. The movie title, \u2018Passing', refers to the practice in which members of oppressed races with skin colours that could be considered white, would \u2018pass' as the unoppressed race.\n\n\u2018Passing' follows two women, Irene Redfield (Tessa Thompson), and Clare Kendry (Ruth Negga), two old high school friends, who happen to run into each other at a hotel during a hot summer day in New York City. As they slowly begin to rekindle their past friendship, a shared obsession threatens both women and their delicately constructed lives.\n\nFor the most part, Rebecca Hall's directorial debut is a triumph, however, some unusual focus choices and abnormal shot compositions can't help draw the viewer out of the black and white world on screen. \u2018The Way Back' cinematographer Eduard Grau provides \u2018Passing' with stylish cinematography that complements the boxy, 4:3 aspect ratio. The returning image size works well to capture the New York landscape and focus on brilliant performances. \u2018Thor: Ragnarok' star Tessa Thompson gives a mesmerising performance as she brings the character of Irene Redfield to life, her intoxicating on-screen presence serves to keep viewers invested across the entire 98-minute run-time. Opposite Thompson is Academy Award nominee Ruth Negga. The \u2018Loving' star gives a brilliant performance alongside Thompson, but her portrayal falls short of matching Thompson's powerhouse performance.\n\n\u2018Passing' also features superb performances from \u2018Moonlight's Andr\u00e9 Holland and Emmy nominee Bill Camp. \u2018Mainstream' composer Devont\u00e9 Hynes provides \u2018Passing' with a light, melodic score that feels like it was plucked out of the 1920s. The twinkly notes accompany the other music featured in the film including Tsegu\u00e9-Maryam Gu\u00e9brou's \u2018The Homeless Wanderer'. Despite being a film whose primary theme is comprised of the racism and discrimination African Americans faced, \u2018Passing' also manages to encompass themes of jealousy and identity. As the film progresses, Hall manages to show how as Clare and Irene's friendship progresses, cracks begin to form in both women's lives. Hall also decides to show these cracks literally by repeatedly focusing on a crack on the ceiling of Irene's bedroom.\n\nCostume designer Marci Rodgers (BlacKkKlansman, No Sudden Move) furnishes the cast of \u2018Passing' with elegant costumes that fit hand in hand with the film's black and white visuals. Netflix's purchase of the film during the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, adds \u2018Passing' to the list of the streamers 2022 awards contenders. The film joins a line-up that includes films like Jane Campion's \u2018The Power of the Dog', Adam McKay's disaster-comedy \u2018Don't Look Up' and Paolo Sorrentino's \u2018The Hand of God' which happened to be selected as Italy's submission for Best International Feature at the 94th Academy Awards.\n\nRebecca Hall's turn as director adds the BAFTA winner to this year's list of actors-turned-directors that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Halle Berry and Lin-Manuel Miranda. \u2018Passing' is a powerful, yet intricate film that features stunning performances from both leads, stylish cinematography, and an unexpected ending.",

    "text": "Weird movie.  Was Irene gay and in love with her old school friend Clare? or did she just admire her bubbly personality and free spirit? Was Brian having an affair with Clare? Where did the maid go, and why did she seem to dislike and disrespect Irene so much? Was the director trying to give us her idea of a Fillini film here? Plant pot falling reference, oh boy. Who knows. I found the whole thing left far too many questions for my liking.  I was also surprised that Clare passed for white and even more surprised that John and others couldn't see that Irene was black - it was obvious to me.",

My grandfather was white passing, so I actually would like a well-done movie on the subject matter. It is a matter of real importance to African Americans.",

The b/w movie changes the shades of grey (metaphorically) with every line of any character making it hard to even think about black and white anymore. You will find yourself tending between characters while seeing injustice in a lot of different forms and against different people. It's one of those incredible movies that shows that injustice is not a problem of a few people that you can point out and say \"let it go\", it's  a part of everyone. The performance of both leading women are incredible. A real gem!",
