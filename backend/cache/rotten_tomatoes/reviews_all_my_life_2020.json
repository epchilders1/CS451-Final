It also had great moments of levity that laced together to really pull at the heartstrings when Sol's diagnosis comes out. I found the movie both wholesome and inspirational even though it has some truly somber aspects. I highly recommend this movie to people looking for a beautiful love story that is set against incredibly tragic odds and yet seeks to prove that all that really matters in this life are the people who love you, and the memories you create together.",
