Good writing and a committed cast, accompanied by a charming Cheech Marin, help convey the nuanced challenges of overcoming prejudices internal and external. Go Mustangs!",

Make no mistake, all the good reviews here are \u00ab planted \u00bb by phoneys and are therefore absolutely untrustworthy.",

All actors in the film delivered such a powerful performance. This movie had such a good underdog story feeling to it, and contained an emotional ending that has all the makings of a soon to be classic.",

In several scenes the US flag is shown, but every time it\u2019s the 50 star flag following the admission of Hawaii and Alaska to the US the end of 1959.
