Storyline NOT the original monster high story. This isn't the monster high people remember or know from when they were little. \nI've seen people on tiktok with better monster high costumes and make up. I like the hair for venus but otherwise catty noir? WHY SHE LOOK like that she doesnt look like an icon anymore. Some characters are messed up and some actually improved. But thats 50/50.\nMovie. STOP MAKING THEM. go back to animating the G1 dolls. Please. I miss the originals",

    "text": "Sorry for writing a bad review, but I honestly feel like Monster High 1 was so much better than the second movie. The characters didn't even look the same in this movie, which was really disappointing for me. However, if you didn't watch the first Monster High movie, it wasn't bad. It has a good message in an off sort of way. I thought the plot was weird, but that's maybe because I loved the first movie soooooooo much!!! You should watch it and decide for yourself",

This movie has ruined my childhood!!!",

They absolutely loved the movie and already watched it 3 times through since it came onto Paramount +. They stated that they love all the characters, outfits, makeup, story, and music. Our wallets are ready to buy whatever dolls release from Monster High 2 and we are all looking forward to the 3rd movie!",

Songs in the first one hit better than these but it's not a complete miss. Caught myself doing little foot taps and sways when listening to the songs. Overall solid 8/10 compared to movie one which I rate a 7/10 . Definitely would like to see a third installment to this series. LOVED the cliffhanger.",
