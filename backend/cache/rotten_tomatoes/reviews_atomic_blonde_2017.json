    "text": "I feel sorry for the people rating this film poorly.  It's a great cast, a thoughtful story that keeps moving forward, good character development, good action (if you don't like action then don't watch action movie.  if you don't like spy then don't watch spy movie).  Amazing musical score too.  And Charlize kicking ass.  The violence is actually realistic.  She moves and acts like a professional, a well trained, experienced and hardened spy.  It's exactly how a hard-as-nails woman would fight against men who are all stronger than her but less skilled.  The attention to detail is *chefs kiss*.  Horrendously violent though, as my mother would say.  The hand to hand combat is visceral and brutal.  Absolutely impeccable acting by Ms. Theron.  Her face after the fight just says it all.  The number of films with realistic and intelligent action sequences you can count on one or two hands.  You can see the John-Wick connection at play here.  What's not to like?  Philistines.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this movie. It's as close to 5 stars as a movie can get for me only because the movie requires you to really, really, really, really pay attention to every single detail or you will get lost, but that is a strength of the movie. You have to pay attention to know what is going on in this spy vs. spy vs. spy story of deception. It's a mystery that you're trying to figure out at the same time as the characters are. The performances are great. James McAvoy is absolutely fantastic but Charlize Theron truly is remarkable as a BAMF lead agent. The fight scenes are INCREDIBLE. She is not an over-powered secret agent. She gets the crap beat out of her in this movie but is so crafty that she is able to get the upper hand constantly being out-muscled. The music is also stellar, and not only that it's great 80s music playing in this movie taking place at the tail end of the 80s, but the music all fits to the situation very well and the versions of the songs fit. They use different versions of the same song depending on the mood of the scene. This movie is smart, thrilling, mysterious, sexy, and action-packed. I think it's incredible.",

    "text": "Atomic Blonde (2017) is a film that thrives on style but stumbles when it comes to substance. Directed by David Leitch, who co-directed the first John Wick, the movie is clearly designed to be a slick, neon-soaked action showcase. And on that level, it works\u2014the fight choreography is brutal, grounded, and exhilarating, with standout sequences that prove Charlize Theron can hold her own as a full-on action star. The stairwell brawl alone is enough to impress anyone looking for raw, bone-crunching spectacle. Unfortunately, the film is bogged down by a story that is not just needlessly convoluted, but downright exhausting to follow. The Cold War espionage setup, with double-crosses, hidden agendas, and unreliable narrators, is presented in such a tangled, over-stylized way that it becomes frustrating instead of engaging. Instead of pulling the viewer deeper into the mystery, the narrative often feels like it\u2019s deliberately confusing, leaving you more lost than invested. Adding to that, the soundtrack\u2014while packed with great 80s hits\u2014feels overused to the point that the film occasionally plays more like a flashy concert movie than a coherent spy thriller. The style overwhelms the storytelling, drowning out what little clarity the plot tries to offer. The ending, capped with a twist, doesn\u2019t help much either. Instead of providing resolution, it leaves even more questions hanging in the air, making the journey feel less rewarding than it should. The result is a movie that looks incredible\u2014gorgeous cinematography, striking 80s soundtrack, and impressive action\u2014but struggles to give you a reason to care beyond the surface. Compared to John Wick, which blends a clean, simple revenge narrative with stylish action, Atomic Blonde feels like it overcomplicates itself to the point of exhaustion. In the end, it\u2019s okay: stylish, entertaining in bursts, but not a spy thriller you walk away from feeling satisfied. Instead, you\u2019re left remembering a handful of great fights, the nonstop music, and wishing the story had been half as sharp as its punches.",

I have to give props to Charlize for doing her own stunts. The fight sequences in this movie are amazing something I have not seen before in an action film. I thought the story, acting, directing and visuals were great and the action scenes were awesome. This is a great action flick and I did not know that this is based on a graphic novel called the coldest city, this is a great film. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. This movie is Cinematastic",

They didn't give Theron much to do beyond act like a tough girl who could fight.  I watched half of it then lost interest.  Technically proficient, but without any human element.",

The grayish-bluish filter perfectly complements the film's aesthetic, given its setting in East Berlin just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In a standout moment, a 10-minute tracking shot showcases a brutal fight and car chase. David Leitch delivers solid action.",

    "text": "What the film offers visually (a drab gray-filter look, unimaginative framing, with occasional neon accents as eye-catchers) is also delivered on a story level: a generic spy plot creates excruciating boredom, interrupted only by the pretty cool fight sequences. Charlize Theron and the rest of the wild double, triple, and quadruple agents are clearly having fun and are trying hard to deliver an entertaining film. But unfortunately, they don't succeed. The cringe-inducing 'coolness' of the characters and the constant needle drops (highlight: an epically sad version of \"99 Luftballons\") do the rest. A few technical deficiencies (especially in the editing) round out the overall impression: a film that wanted to be but couldn't. Better read the comic.",

I personally don't know the historical context on which it is based and I have been lost throughout the film. The cast is phenomenal, but a little wasted. The jewel in the crown are the action sequences, especially the one on the stairs, which has given the film half a star. Theron is great, and the stunts too.\nThe movie leaves a very good taste in the mouth, especially because of the sound and the aesthetic of the film, a marvel.",

This was Charlize Theron's passion project and the work she put in (on and off screen) before, during, and after shooting showed. Far from John Wick, in which his movie was inspired by, but very entertaining all the same.",
