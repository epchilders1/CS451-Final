Instant \u201cwho\u2019s the mole\u201d mystery that kept me guessing with solid clues and slick action (gunfights, hand-to-hand). Loved the nuclear \u201cfootball\u201d nod after House of Dynamite\u20142025\u2019s hot prop! But mid-movie slips into usual traitor tropes, nothing fresh. 6/10: tight 90-minute thrill, great for a quick suspense fix.",

We absolutely LOVED it!!! \n\nFrom start to finish, this movie delivered on high-octane action and suspense, with a solid storyline that doesn't just bulldoze you with special effects like some movies do; but it engrosses you into it's world with the same gripping finality of a hand-to-hand combat in a life or death match. \n\nThe director, Jamie Marshall, flips the script on us in terms of the classic traitor-in-our-midst. And he paces this storytelling so well, that even during the quieter moments of the film, where the coast feels safe to have empathy for some characters, we're never left wishing the time to go fast or slower than what's playing out in front of us. The main actors each deliver their character's arcs with such a lived-in nuance it kept the traitor's reveal a surprise to the end.\n\nOne of the most amazing and notable things about this movie is that ALL the actors are doing their own stunts! No stunt doubles needed here when you have a cadre of highly-trained actors, like the underrated action star Lewis Tan, led by the renown stunt coordinator Arnold Chon. Every punch thrown, every kick snapped, and every shot fired feels like a visceral shock to the viewer's senses, and I'm glad the wall-to-wall screen of a movie theater enhanced that effect.\n\nOf note, in a time when creatives are starting to be outpaced by AI, I think this movie will set an example for years to come as the kind of action film where hands-on creativity, disciplined innovation, and deliberate storytelling will always take precedence.\n\nWell done to everyone involved in this film, and thank you for the experience!",

Jamie Marshall keeps it tight, tense, and stylish. The fights hit hard, the acting\u2019s solid, and it never drags. Some twists are obvious, but it\u2019s still a blast to watch. Great action, great cast, great direction.",

    "text": "Wish I could have seen this on the big screen! It was intense, fast paced and well thought out. I did manage to guess the twist, but the acting, stunts and action were phenomenal, from the starring actors, but also the actors with smaller roles. Sam Tan utilised his moments on screen skillfully (he was one of the police officers in the beginning) and as for the starring actors...\n\nLucien Laviscount's performance was truly amazing and when you watch it you'll understand why. This is the first time seeing him in an action film and he really stood out for me.\n\nLewis Tan was a stand out as always. When it comes to action you can tell he gives it his all and he made every fight scene explosive, entertaining and somehow look effortless. His intense ability to lock you in during those scenes were so on point.\n\nHonestly, the action and the acting from everyone really sold this film for me, I do wish that we got to delve a bit more into some of the other characters in the beginning of the film, and I do feel like if you're quite vigilant you can guess part of the plot, so I techinically give it a 4.5 out of 5, but honestly everything else makes up for it. Throughly enjoyed this film.",
