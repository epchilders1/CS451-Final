    "text": "Netflix Christmas films are Lohan\u2019s new niche. One of the many Christmas movies produced by Netflix, \u201cOur Little Secret\u201d generated buzz during the 2024 holiday season by delivering exactly what the public wants from a casual Christmas film: some laughs and some heart in a predictable, yet entertaining package. Lindsay Lohan is learning the art of being charming even in simple, seasonal films from Christmas movie veteran and co-star, Kristin Chenoweth. This film has plenty of plot holes and overused tropes, but it\u2019s palatably enjoyable for the diverse audiences that gather for the holidays. Lohan is going to be cashing checks every December like Mariah!",

    "text": "Boring, boring, boring. Two previously involved couple are reunited at Christmas ten years later with their new significant others, who just happen to be siblings and have a faintly sinister mother. Stuck under the same roof, the old flame rekindles, which is clearly to be expected.\nWhile the plot might be foolproof, the presentation was not really funny where it was supposed to be and I found myself laughing at things that were not really funny. I suppose it was schadenfreude.\nIt wasn\u2019t worth watching. The acting wasn\u2019t up to par and I found myself wondering why Lohan would lend herself to such a tawdry spectacle.",

The lead male actor, Ian Harding, although the same age as Lindsay looks somewhat younger.  Reasonable acting.  Plot acceptable.  The credits don\u2019t say who the principle directors or producers were.  Why ?  Somebody close to Lindsay ?",

    "text": "The intro of the movie shows that the two main characters are deeply and hopelessly in love with each other. Past that point I do not ever see a sliver of this \"inseparable, deep love\" between these two actors and their characters. They're stiff, it's uncomfortable, and I don't want them in the same room together. If she were so deeply in love with him and they were so perfect together why would the first proposal scene be met with such visceral negativity. The male love interest is shown in the first couple minutes to be manipulative, blaming her for *his* drinking, for moving away to chase her dreams, vandalizes things and has a tantrum. It's not a movie for me, but I didn't go in with high hopes anyway.",

Her acting was so bad I am not sure if she was always this bad or the facial fillers have frozen her face so much she can no longer act? The worst part was that the person she played would surely have been much, much younger? The ditzy comic act she played in years gone by does not work anymore for a woman of her age. The storyline totally predictable. The dialogue was bad. 'Oh it feels so Christmassy when it snows'. Seriously.  Bad wigs, bad makeup and terrible fake tans just added to this flop.",
