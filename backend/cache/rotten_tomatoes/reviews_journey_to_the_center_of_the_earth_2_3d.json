I was glued to the screen the entire time it was so fun and interesting and the fact that it teaches you about union and about creatures in today\u2019s world was awesome!! It was amazing I\u2019m not usually a watch show type of person but this took the cake 100%! I would definitely watch more movies like this one. I watched it November 2025 I noticed it came about 2012 and it was still very interesting. It was touching especially during certain parts and tears came to my eyes. I loved it lol would definitely recommend 10/10",

    "text": "It's bad. I love how they as loosely as possible try to tie this into the 2008 movie. Besides Sean being in it, it has nothing in common at all with the 2008 movie. The music is ok, the aciting isn't good, the cinematography is terrible, the editing isn't good, and the pacing is horrific. Guzman is just degrading himself here as the comedic relief and is terribly unfunny. Hudgens is alright but just the forgettable love interest. Everyone else is just subpar. The Rock is just once again playing himself and the same character he is in every film. It's the most surface level character stuff and half the time it's just plot expose. The 3D special effects are just as bad as the 08' one and look laughably bad. Major strike for that. At best the direction is basic and worst it's a green screen CGI fest that looks like a video game more than a movie. Than it starts jumping around between Guzman, Hutchinson/Hudgens, and the Rock during the escape. The worst part about this though honestly is the insane amount of dumb farfetched moments this throws at you nonstop. It's literally as bad as Rise of Skywalker at points. How does the 140 year old submarine still work? The Rock in jeans and a t shirt throwing a spear at a giant CGI shark. Conspiracy theory opening to setup getting to the island. It's literally insane. This is just mindless insanity and action thrills nonstop with little downtime. At least the 08' one was better executed and had much less farfetched stuff in it. Which is saying a lot because it still had farfetched moments for thrills. Skip this. It just devolves into mindless fare.",

It has a lots of plot holes and is one of those rare gems of a \"hey it didn't turn out like they intended, but they way it did turn out was better\" films. You could also say \"so bad its good,\" but I don't think the movie is actually bad. When I wasn't laughing at a plot hole, the film provided some good jokes.",
