He beats up about 500 dudes with no effort, only to get beat up by 2 chicks at the end, just to have a girl boss moment... \nThen those 2 chicks get taken out in the lamest and easiest way ever, just to have it make even less sense.\nVillain also tried way too hard, and failed at it. She wasn't as cool or intimidating as the movie thought she was. Just weird. And her actions would've got her whole operation shut down in no time, since she's not very smart, and kills everyone and everything.",

And utilizes many tropes from the first film, sometimes effectively, and other times, not so much. In the end, it just feels like a recycled version of the original film.",

This sequel received half-decent reviews, so I duly paid out my \u00a35 rental fee for couple of days worth of exercise material.  What a mistake: yet another ludicrous action flick that gets the tone entirely wrong, such that the violence is deeply unpleasant but lacking any visceral excitement, and the comic aspect simply makes the whole thing tension-free.  And the action scenes simply don\u2019t make any sense whatsoever.  Several critics I think are usually pretty okay are now on my NEVER TRUST list, and yes, I am talking about you Mark Kermode!",

    "text": "If you watched the original entry of this franchise in 2021 and enjoyed seeing the usually comedic and quick-witted Bob Odenkirk turn into an unconventional action star, chances are you\u2019ll enjoy this follow-up.\n\nThe plot doesn\u2019t stray too far from the original concept featured in the first installment. The location and characters may have changed, but writer Derek Kolstad, this time teaming with Aaron Rabin, doesn\u2019t muddle up a formula that worked the first time.\n\nThe story, while somewhat fresh in the initial outing, is secondary to the action sequences pitting Odenkirk in a role you\u2019re still not really used to seeing him play.\n\nSharon Stone is a nice addition in a villainous role, alongside Colin Hanks as a corrupt sheriff. It\u2019s always a pleasure to see 87-year-old Christopher Lloyd on screen, and, although his role is brief, The RZA continues to show just how well-rounded he is as an actor, composer, and rapper.\n\nThis movie doesn\u2019t break new ground, but I\u2019m ok with that. It\u2019s a fun watch for when you just want to be entertained for 90 minutes.",
