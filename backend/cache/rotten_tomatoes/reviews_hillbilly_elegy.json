It was great to see Freida Pinto again, she always seems to brighten the screen when she is on. But, this movie is nothing that we have not read or watched before. Ron Howard has definitely done better Biopics. \nBut, it is a solid campaign add, that is for sure.",

    "text": "A well made movie about the disintegration of family and economy in post-industrial Rust Belt America. Vance does a service in reporting about a deeper history and culture of Appalachia that is alien even to others in rural Midwest, South and other regions. Adams and Close are great and the lead does a good job. Yet a hopeful message showing that multigenerational families weather storms",

I couldn't finish in one sitting, which might be my own patience or the fact that it's not so gripping, but in the end, I felt it was a worthwhile watch.",

Many people don\u2019t understand how difficult it is to remove yourself from the life you were brought up in.\n\nI had a family that told me \u201ccollege isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d and I grew up thinking the only option was working on farms for minimal cash flow. If you\u2019ve never experienced this situation, it can be hard to truly understand that lifestyle. That\u2019s why this movie means so much to me, and it has my full support.",

This movie is not only an excellent film the acting by everyone especially Glen Close \n(Who should have at least been nominated for an academy award) the actors were superb. \nYou really don\u2019t see this much honesty in a film nowadays. Vance was a product of a messy home life and became a mess of a person, but he listened to his meemaw and pulled himself up out of that life. Look at him today. I have a feeling if he hadn\u2019t become a GOP VP many of those bad reviews would be glowing",
