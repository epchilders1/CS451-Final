It features a very interesting cast, including the Hemsworth brothers (Thor family), Milo Ventimiglia (the eternal Peter Petrelli), not to mention the immortal Gladiator. The plot, focusing on the acrobatics and tricks of the drone universe, was the highlight.\nIt's worth checking out.",

    "text": "Land of Bad (2024) is directed by William Eubank, who has been gaining respect for his previous films at film festivals that don\u2019t have much showbiz focus. In recent works such as Underwater (2020), The Signal (2014), Crave (2012), Love (2011), and House of the Rising Sun (2011), he earned titles and was nominated several times.\nHowever, his films are not widely known since they are not blockbusters. Even so, Land of Bad features Chris Hemsworth\u2019s relatives \u2014 Thor himself. This film also includes Russell Crowe in a supporting role. Even in a secondary role, he would have deserved a Best Supporting Actor award. Without Reaper, Kinney would have failed the mission, and the CIA would have shut down the operation.\nRegarding the script, the film follows a rescue and survival storyline. Screenwriter David Frigerio wrote Crypto in 2019, but there were three people on the screenplay, which may have hurt that film.",

The reason this is only get 4 stars is the militia\u2019s aim was about as good as stormtroopers in A New Hope and I think this could have been better and would have made the action scenes a little less one sided.",

If you have a military mind and understand the capabilities involved in operations, this movie will not disappoint. The acting was superb, the story had a really good flow. Only thing that had me a little perplexed was the whole basketball thing. Glad that 9i took care of that. This one had me glued for the entire movie!",

If you\u2019re ex military or just knowledgeable about anything military this film if going to upset you viscerally. What blows my mind is the positive reviews on here what the f*** are you people talking about?!",
