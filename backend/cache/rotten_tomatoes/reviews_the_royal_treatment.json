But it's a lot of fun because it is aware of its own stereotype and enjoys it. The backgrounds and costumes are all consciously like a fairy tale, even the ending is a quote from \"Pretty Woman.\" And the actors have charm. It's a fun movie and not stupid.",

I was expecting an unrealistic yet warm-hearted romance, instead I had to watch the annoying main character pretending to be the purest and kindest person in the whole world while preaching others how they should live and treat others. I really wanted to stop watching 10 mins in, but I treated this as a Hallmark satire and continued just to find out how worse it can get.",

Too bad for the main male actor and a couple of others, like the butler, who were nice.\nThe main actress is annnooooying, faaake, fake, fake, and totally inexpressive. Her acting is stiff, forced and that constant smile is just terrible. \nThe movie is just a huge cliche from the begining to the end, and so many cringe moments that it would take way too much time  to write them all, well, actually I would have to basically tell the movie from begining to the end. \nI truly do not understand how netflix finances such horrendous productions. \nI mean, I once wanted to submit some comedy scripts, with original plots, as far as I know (I haven't seen a movie with that plot), but I came to find out they have a closed team who writes their scripts... And to me that is mind blowing. Your a ww movie platform, you're forced to kind of make movies constantly, but you rely solely on a bunch of people to come up with ideas.. Mmmhweeel this is the result. Inbreading in movie world.... Which is extremely sad, not only for the actors but especially for the public. They have 100 movies that repeat the same story over and over, but with different actors and d\nThe Princess switch was also cringey, but this... This gets the gold medal with no efforts.",
