    "text": "I liked it. It\u2019s low-budget, for sure, but the film wisely chooses to focus on the interpersonal relationships of the characters rather than the monsters and the lore. In a lot of ways, the threat itself is secondary to the film and could easily be swapped out with any other mysterious force. The politics of the trapped townspeople get really interesting, elevated by mostly good performances. I especially appreciated the religious allegory of the hate that\u2019s become so prevalent in our society. The ending was a surprise (in a good way) and feels very Stephen-King. It\u2019s a tight film that, despite some hit-or-miss CGI and plot-driven logic, proves effectively scary and leaves you thinking.",
