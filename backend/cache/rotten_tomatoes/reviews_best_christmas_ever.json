Not much tho. Just so disappointing. I expected a fun movie with real actors and it was worse than any bad Hallmark. Im not sure where her ability to actually act went but it was completely gone here.",

Watched it with my family and they usually like these kinds of movies but they thought this movie was only okay. Good for background noise, would not recommend if you want to get actually invested in the movie.",

    "text": "I\u2019m a big fan of Jason Biggs because of the \"American Pie\" movies, but not even he could save \"Best Christmas Ever\". The plot is so generic and predictable, and I barely laughed, maybe chuckled a couple of times. There are so many cringe moments, and the child actors are really bad. I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters at all. The story felt like it was written by AI, and some of the emotional stuff, like the death of a kid, made me laugh because it was so unbelievably written.  \n\nHeather Graham was the highlight, though, and probably the only good thing about the movie. Mary Lambert once again proves that she is incapable of directing a film. It also doesn\u2019t know what kind of movie it wants to be; comedy, drama, or something else. Overall, it\u2019s just really badly written and a total waste of time.",
