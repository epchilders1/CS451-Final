    "text": "I made an account to review this movie. I hope nothing like this ever gets created again. The historical intrigue of this story is entirely lost in horrific writing, bad acting, and poor and isolating cinematography. What a waste of all resources this film had available. The characters are unlikeable dog abusers, the script is a 12 year old attempting drama, and there is simply no suspense or tension in the entire film. By the halfway mark I was cheering for the ice or a bear to off these terrible pieces of garbage unlikeable British pirates pretending to be Danish. This movie made me angry at it. It truly sucked to experience. Joe Cole should fight to keep this off his career list as it makes him look untalented. Charles Dance's performance was the best because it was only a few seconds for the director to ruin.",

It could not have been a lot of fun shooting a movie in a sheer freezing climate. Take it from one who spent 3 years up North where one's extremeties can freeze in a very, very  short time.",

Acting, plot, setting, cinematography, all excellent. Reading the audience reviews, apparently some viewers got frustrated in the second half.  But it was based on an autobiography and all the events rang true under such dire circumstances. I'd recommend it.",

    "text": "Roughing the elements.  So back in 1909, a crew of Danes set on an exploration mission.  They have to prove that the northern part of Greenland is not separated by a river to disprove the United States' claim to the land.  This is about a captain (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and a volunteer mechanic (Joe Cole) who trek a great distance to recover some lost evidence from a previous expedition.  This will be the equivalent of walking from Moscow to Rome looking for a stack of stones.  Now I was looking for a movie to watch on a random day off that I had.  Netflix is good for that, and they routinely have new material in their library that you never knew existed.  The only thing I knew about Against the Ice is that it starred Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jaime Lannister), so I decided to roll the dice.  It's a mixed bag, but I ultimately think you can find a better survival movie for your valuable time.  Now it's not like I was watching this with crossed arms and a stiff upper lip.  I wanted to be on board with this.  I was with it at the beginning, and I felt like it gets off to a promising start.  The story doesn't waste a lot of time messing around, and it isn't long before these two are breaking from the group and hitting the tundra.  In fact, I would even go so far to say that this story goes harder than it needs to.  It's the top of the 20th century we are talking about here, so the way to traverse Greenland is via sled dog.  They give you a foreboding warning before the journey gets going that this journey isn't likely to go well for the canines, and it ends up about as you expect.  This could be a potential trigger for dog lovers, even though the very worst all happens offscreen.  The biggest problem with Against the Ice is that these two characters that you're spending all your time with aren't that deep.  You have the closed-off alpha male and the naive inexperienced guy, and they are pretty much playing types.  It's almost exclusively surface level, and I'm sorry but pining for girls isn't a compelling enough reason for me to connect with the leads.  I think that Cole and Coster-Waldau are both doing as their directed, but I still found myself craving more rounded performances.  I was with Against the Ice when these two are journeying.  There is constant peril, and even though they aren't deep characters, I was engaged in what would happen, if only for dogs.  I got very bored and restless in the third act, and I think that is a design flaw in the story.  It is just garden variety characters-going-stir-crazy, and it is frankly quite dull.  It spoiled any goodwill I had toward the film as a whole, and it made me unwilling to overlook other shortcomings.",
