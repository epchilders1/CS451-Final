    "text": "The Marine, starring John Cena as John Triton, is an action thriller about a marine who returns home from active duty and takes a job as a security agent. But his peaceful life is shattered when his wife, Kate Triton (played by Kelly Carlson), is abducted by a group of criminals, forcing him to tap back into his military instincts to track them down and save her.\n\nThe film has a lot of problems\u2014especially being a WWE Studios production. WWE movies tend to lack polish, often feeling cheaply made or missing the depth and quality of traditional theatrical releases.\n\nBut I will say that, even with its flaws, I did enjoy it. It was fun enough to keep me entertained and honestly something I wouldn\u2019t mind rewatching down the line. It\u2019s actually a decent action film that follows John Cena pretty closely and lets him shine in a way that fits who he is. This was one of his early roles, so the director really leaned into letting the audience connect with both Triton and his wife. Unlike some of Cena\u2019s later movies where it feels like he\u2019s being overbooked or thrown into scenes just because of his name, this film actually gave him room to build the character.\n\nIt has its moments\u2014some over-the-top action, a few cheesy lines, but enough tension and pacing to carry it through. I definitely recommend checking it out. It\u2019s not a masterpiece by any means, but it\u2019s far from a bad movie.",

Hoje em seus filmes sempre tem seu papel c\u00f4mico. Cena aqui sua interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 ao estilo Arnold nos seus primeiros, quero dizer \u00e9 a mesma fisionomia do inicio ao fim, onde concetra tudo na a\u00e7\u00e3o, correria e porradaria. Um filme que gostei do enredo. Onde Cena volta para sua casa e para sua esposa Kate (Carlson). E temos em paralelo Rome (Patrick), Angela (Bianca), Morgan (Parker),.. e sua quadrilha que roubaram dimantes. E nesta fuga pegam Kate e acabam usando como ref\u00e9m. E agora Cena far\u00e1 de tudo para resgata-la. A\u00ed agora a\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 o fim. E temos Robert Patrick que \u00e9 o vil\u00e3o. E existe toda uma persegui\u00e7\u00e3o na mata, nos rios,..... Desde esta \u00e9poca Cena me chamou aten\u00e7\u00e3o e depois de 12 Rounds gostei mais ainda. Porem depois ele deu uma sumida e agora em toda esquina vemos ele em um filme. \nRoteiro e enredo boa.\nVale apena assistir? sim\nNota: 7",

    "text": "Jon Cena's 'The Marine' offers a dose of action and thrills but falls short in creating a compelling connection to the characters. While Cena's performance and the action sequences deliver entertainment, the film struggles to immerse the audience in the characters' journey, leaving it feeling more like a showcase of stunts rather than an engaging narrative. It's akin to a thrilling stunt show, providing moments of excitement but lacking the depth needed to truly captivate the audience. Worth a watch for action enthusiasts, but don't expect a deep emotional investment in the story.",
