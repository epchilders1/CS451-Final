    "text": "I wasn't all that familiar with the Menendez Brothers besides the headline, and for the most part, I left it at that. \nBut, I was interested. \nAnd, so I indulged in this doc - and, I was utterly shocked. The sensitive themes discussed now with an unbiased, open-minded perspective of these current times compared to the 80s - were much needed. Many missteps and this tragic story... I'm really glad one of the most well-known crime stories has been given a chance to tell all sides with the defendants themselves, credible witnesses and mounts of footage in full with an empathetic lens, that was not present when the original events took place. Re-writing the narrative, focusing on what truly matters - this film seamlessly walked us through almost 100+ worth of history surrounding a supposed nuclear family and the lengthly subsequent trials with grace and insight. \nMust watch for those who are interested~!",

    "text": "Very dark and depressing true story crime drama about the two brothers who were relentlessly sexually abused by their cruel and merciless father throughout their childhood and entire teenhood. They were neglected by their mother who did absolutely nothing to protect them from him which led to them killing their parents. The movie is very intense and heartbreaking. I absolutely feel for the brothers and am absolutely appalled by all the negative reviews dehumanizing the Menendez brothers. Gender bias has definitely got to play a big role in all of the negativity. This movie is extremely well acted and well made. One of the best lifetime movies. I can\u2019t believe the jury was stupid enough to find them guilty. I\u2019m sure all the negative reviewers siding with the prosecutors would\u2019ve done the same thing too if they were in the Menendez brothers\u2019 shoes.",

Yall are forgetting that this isn't just some movie these brothers actually lived through this. \n\nNext time you think about making a movie based off of other people's life traumas don't",

    "text": "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve learned anything further in this documentary that I had already known when the brothers were repeatedly tried for murder  throughout the 90\u2019s. The brothers claimed they were sexually abused from almost the beginning of this story. There were experts & family to claim the duo were abused but as far from what I watched nothing new in the form of forensics or evidence. I honestly believe that if folks in the US were given the opportunity in deciding the fate of the brothers then the two would earn their freedom as I believe many would decide from their hearts. I believe in the US judicial system in most cases but in others I think it\u2019s a complete banana republic. For these two brothers to even be given a chance at parole even though they were sentenced to life with none is surprising to say the least for the manner in which they committed the crime & to whom & without question it was 100% premeditated. I truly believe the brothers are receiving this recognition because of the men they\u2019ve become in prison being role modeled prisoners. The prosecutor that recommended the brothers receive the parole hearings is a complete an incompetent fool. In my honest opinion I do not think these brothers deserve the light of day for freedom. I gave the documentary 3 stars. It was ok but nothing throughout the film gave me the aw factor",

    "text": "Wow. Some of these reviews are so grossly ignorant it\u2019s infuriating. Family of the murdered parents corroborated the abuse, and people still want to say they\u2019re lying?????? The gender bias is glaring. The way these brothers were treated about their testimony is why male victims of abuse rarely disclose. We need to do better. If they had been young women, they would\u2019ve had resounding support. Their actions would\u2019ve been considered against the weight of the horrors they\u2019d endured. The naysayers might as well go sit in a corner with a dunce hat on and delete their social accounts. Tom Cruise wouldn\u2019t have been able to portray the emotion of their testimony surrounding the abuse, so to claim they are faking is laughable.",

    "text": "Going back and rehashing this is a last ditch effort for these two who viciously killed both their parents in cold blood only as a attempt to free themselves. TRUTH they both were old enough to leave out on their own.\nThey had the opportunities to succeed and move on they didn't have to live at home. Lest you forget the spending spree post murder,and the lack of remorse on their part. They want to play the total victims here & act like their actions were warranted..Maybe I'm the only one who sees their manipulated game. They did what they did because of greed. I see self defense BUT they didn't kill in self defense and literally blew their parents to pieces. They're despicable and this documentary is a waste..Silenced the parents who now can't defend the accusations..pathetic",

    "text": "This documentary is very well done. At the time of the trial, I thought the brothers had created a completely false defense. But 30 years after the fact, I think there is truth to the allegations of molestation. The cousin's testimony, which I didn't see during the trial, is very convincing. The newly found letter, if it's age can be authenticated, is also compelling. And an allegation of abuse by a young man visiting their home is corroborating, as well, if credible. Watching their testimony today, the emotions they exhibit appear genuine. As one juror commented, either they're the best actors in the world, or they were telling the truth. 30 plus years ago, sexual abuse of boys was not something that was often discussed or acknowledged. At the time, I couldn't imagine a father abusing his sons. And yet, we believe girls who say their father abused them, and we know for a fact that it happens with some frequency. Our (or my) understanding of this abuse is clearer today. Sadly, Leslie Abramson would not participate in the documentary. Extremely selfish of her. She didn't win the case so apparently felt there was no more to say. If she truly believed in her client, she owed it to him and to us to speak her truth regarding guilt or innocence, as well as detailing the judge's bias in the second trial. Highly disturbing were the rulings by the judge that did not allow testimony on the alleged abuse. What? The 2nd jury had every right to hear this testimony. I was also shocked to hear that the father found a therapist who agree that anything the boys discussed with him would be reported to the father. This is simply outrageous. I think the brothers did have to be held accountable for the murders, especially for the murder of their mother. I don't believe they feared her. As suggested in the film, she was \"collateral damage.\" But putting all the pieces together today, I think a sentence of manslaughter would have been more appropriate. The evidence that they were abused as well as their testimony, for me, today rings true. And their mother did not protect them. Battered syndromes are not just a defense for women. Good documentary. Hard to fit everything related to their lives and the case into two short hours, but it shed light on this case and I see it much more clearly and differently than I was able to 30 years ago.",

    "text": "'The Menendez Brothers' is the documentary film of the events which happened in the 1990's, and sort of a follow up to the 'Monsters' series which aired earlier on Netflix.\n\nSYNOPSIS: 'In 1996, the Menendez brothers faced trial for killing their parents, a case that captivated America. Years later, they share their side through interviews with those involved, offering a fresh take on the events.'\n\nAs excellent as this is I'm always unsure why Sky creates a dramatised version of a story to then, a week later, release a documentary version of the same story. \n\nBoth are incredibly strong in their own right but did we need both? I'm unsure we do.\n\nMore here than with the dramatic interpretation, you're allowed a better opportunity to make an educated decision on the case through all of the evidence.\n\nA proper compendium piece.\n\n7/10",

I felt like it was rushed and short when there\u2019s so many details involved. I also wish the cut Pamela\u2019s part shorter. She was annoying and clearly still very bitter about this situation. It doesn\u2019t matter why the brothers case has revived more popularity, the important part as that it did. \u201cTik Tok\u201d raised awareness for their case and hopefully inspired them to continue to fight for their freedom.",

It was difficult to listen to the young men's testimonies about their abuse from their father.  Lyle had reached out to his mother several times, and she did nothing.  I have not watched the Ryan Murphy show, as I felt the story from the perspective of the actual brothers would be more factual.  This is a tough show to watch, but it is well worth it.",

For the First time we get The chance to have The brother's point off view, but Also The prosecutior POV, which honestly I couldn't disagree more, I found It so dumb, the woman seems not to want Justice, Just to win. This is someone's trauma, life and Destiny what we are talking about.\n30 Years Ago media coverage picture this guys like Monsters. In this time and age I think psicology has evolved a lot, and we have a different picture about trauma response and those extremely complicated issues. According to today's standards we would treat them better and not make Fun off them like 90' comedy did.\nAfter watching both the doc and murphy's drama, my only conclusion is Second trial was not completely Fair, I really Hope their case can be revised in the near Future.",
