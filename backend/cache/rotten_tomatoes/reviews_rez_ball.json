    "text": "Rez Ball is an interesting and mostly entertaining film. It feels authentic, but is let down by a fairly standard and predictable story that keeps it from soaring. The film is the story of a high school basketball team in New Mexico. They have talent but aren't fairing well in their new season, despite the return of their star player from injury. They have to oversome personal tragedy early in their season as well. But they don't play well together. After a long losing streak, they finally start to pull together. Perhaps their goal of winning a state title is still in reach. The cast are nearly all Native American and they do a reasonale job without being stellar. An enjoyable film, but not one that feels unique enough.",

    "text": "Rez Ball is an entertaining movie centered around the game of basketball that I had the pleasure of watching with my son. Released in 2024, the film features a cast of relatively unknown actors, bringing fresh faces to the screen.\n\nThe movie is a delightful experience, skillfully directed with a vibrant energy and a solid script. It not only captures the team's quest to succeed but also delves into the personal struggles of each character, allowing viewers to connect with them on a deeper level.\n\nRegarding the screenplay, I found it to be well-crafted overall, though there were a few instances where certain scenes could have been tweaked for clarity or impact. Nonetheless, the film remains an enjoyable journey, perfect for a casual rewatch. While it may not be a film you'd rush to see repeatedly, it certainly offers enough charm to make a return visit worthwhile.\n\nMy son genuinely loved the movie, which speaks volumes coming from a child who typically prefers animated features or superhero flicks. His enthusiasm for Rezz Ball highlights its appeal beyond the typical genre expectations.",

Could have went on more about the team buildups and not focus on the fast win and how badly the team did. Also it should have shown more to make the story more awesome. It felt like I was watching Money Ball but it was basketball on the Rez. Watched as the coach was from Frontier and it was on Netflix\u2026.It had potential but got lost in translation and was rushed in a bad way.",

Um grupo improv\u00e1vel, se ergue com um sonho que para a maioria passa de utopia. Ainda mais quando o principal jogador tira a sua pr\u00f3pria vida, por n\u00e3o suportar a perda da m\u00e3e e irm\u00e3. Aqui ao inv\u00e9s de afro descendentes, latinos ou desajustados, tem um time de \u00edndios americanos. E um jogo com o principal time e acabam perdendo. Como superar todos estes obst\u00e1culos? Temos uma equipe que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o uma equipe e a t\u00e9cnica que busca uma outra cidade para ser t\u00e9cnica. Com todas a adversidade, o grupo come\u00e7a a superar degrau por degrau cada obst\u00e1culo. At\u00e9 o momento que come\u00e7am a vencer jogos e mais jogos. At\u00e9 o momento que o sucesso acaba sendo outro momento de queda. Quando acha-se imbat\u00edveis e quebram a disciplina e a ordem. V\u00e1rios dos jogadores ficam de porre no dia do grande jogo e perdem. Mais uma vez aprendendo v\u00e3o competir novamente. At\u00e9 que vencem e se sagram campe\u00f5es. Agora a t\u00e9cnica tem v\u00e1rias ofertas de emprego, mas agora descide ficar com a equipe.\nRoteiro e enredo j\u00e1 conhecidos e bem executado, trazendo um novo ingrediente que foi a perca de um dos integrantes.\nVale apena assistir? Sim\nNota: 6",

    "text": "How many of these rag tag kids go from outcasts to heroes sports movies do we need? Watch Bad News Bears, Hoosiers, Mighty Ducks then repeat if you want to watch the same movie again. For that matter, if you substitute an individual for the kids, you can just watch Rocky (the first 3 anyway) or Million Dollar Baby and get all the underdog overcomes adversity to win sports contest thrills you will ever need.\n\nRez Ball is just the same plot with poor direction, no development of a connection between the viewer and the character, obtrusive musical montages instead of actual acting and checking off some Dine stereotypes. Oh, and if they said the phrase \"Rez Ball\" one more time, I planned on sticking an icepick into my eardrums.\n\nI'm all for using Native American actors in films wherever you want to cast them. Just make sure you create a good movie first.",
