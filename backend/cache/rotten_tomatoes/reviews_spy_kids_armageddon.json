Anyway, movie decent, fight scene looks like it came out of a Disney Star Wars film \ud83e\udd2e. The animation was good sometimes but not always.",

    "text": "Okay so I have seen every spy kids made and I am partial to the very first three. As years went by I was disappointed with the other spykids movies which did drop the ball. But today I decided to watch spykids: Armageddon movie with my 6 year old and it pleasantly surprised me. It brought me back to when I was 6 years old watching the originals. It had a good plot with a good lesson and point that as spy's can do anything so why can't you do good while being good person which brought me a great nostalgia when watching. Plus my son loved it so much he is already planning to watch it again. I recommend watching it with gamers and gamer kids all alike.",

    "text": "*Spy Kids: Armageddon* is a disappointing attempt at reviving a beloved franchise. The absence of Juni and Carmen Cortez leaves a gaping hole that no amount of CGI can fill. The film's humor falls flat, with not a single laugh to be found, making the comedic moments feel forced and awkward. The plot is painfully thin and predictable, offering little in terms of excitement or surprise.\n\nBilly Magnussen's villain lacks any real menace or depth, coming off as a cartoonish caricature rather than a legitimate threat. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez do their best to inject life into their roles, but the weak script gives them little to work with. The film misses the heart and charm that made the original series special, resulting in a dull, lifeless experience. Unfortunately, *Spy Kids: Armageddon* fails to recapture the magic, leaving me bored and disappointed.",

    "text": "\"Pequenos Espi\u00f5es: Armagedom\" \u00e9 uma obra que, francamente, nunca deveria ter visto a luz do dia. O roteiro \u00e9 absolutamente desastroso, desprovido de qualquer subst\u00e2ncia ou coer\u00eancia narrativa. Os jovens atores, embora esfor\u00e7ados, claramente carecem da experi\u00eancia necess\u00e1ria para sustentar um filme desta magnitude. O desfecho, ins\u00edpido e repleto de clich\u00eas, apenas refor\u00e7a a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que este \u00e9 um projeto for\u00e7ado, que tenta, sem sucesso, se alinhar ao crescente mercado de filmes \"family-friendly\".\n\nO que mais surpreende \u00e9 a fragilidade dos efeitos especiais, que parecem ter sido desenvolvidos sem qualquer preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com qualidade ou inova\u00e7\u00e3o. Em um momento em que o p\u00fablico espera mais de produ\u00e7\u00f5es voltadas para crian\u00e7as, este filme se destaca negativamente em todos os aspectos: enredo, dire\u00e7\u00e3o, e execu\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnica. \u00c9, sem d\u00favida, uma obra que jamais deveria ter superado a fase de concep\u00e7\u00e3o. A aprova\u00e7\u00e3o desse projeto por parte dos executivos da Netflix levanta s\u00e9rias quest\u00f5es sobre os crit\u00e9rios utilizados para selecionar e produzir conte\u00fado.",

It\u2019s basically a carbon copy of the first movie and the third movie mixed into one. It doesn\u2019t include any of the original stars and doesn\u2019t have the same feel as the first 3.

Though once we get to the 2nd half of the movie that's when the best part's finally reach there full potential \ud83e\udd29\nMy Pikachu: Yah.
