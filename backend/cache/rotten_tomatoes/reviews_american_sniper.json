Action scenes were a little too violent for me, but it was based on true story of veterans so 10/10 for me! \n\nOne thing that makes the film almost un-rewatchable is Chris's lack of faith. It may be the reason for his untimely death. He seems like a mans man but not in a Christlike way. We have to respect the sacrifices that people make for our freedom, but, without faith, it felt like something was missing.",

Clint Eastwood provides strong direction and the action scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. It does a great job showing the psychological effects of war\u2014especially PTSD. While some may debate its politics, as a character-driven war film, it left a strong impression on me. This will easily go down as one of my favorite war movies.",

    "text": "American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper, is a solid film that delivers a strong war narrative and gives audiences a gritty, realistic portrayal of a sniper\u2019s life on and off the battlefield. I respect what the movie tried to do\u2014it brought a grounded war story to the big screen with moments that were emotionally impactful and visually striking.\n\nThat said, while I acknowledge that it\u2019s a good film, it didn\u2019t fully land for me the way it did for many others. One of my biggest issues was the heavy reliance on dialogue over action. For a film centered around a sniper and the chaos of war, I was hoping for a more action-driven experience. Instead, the movie leaned more into personal conversations and emotional weight, which may work for some, but it dragged for me at times.\n\nI also felt like this film had the potential to spark a truly compelling franchise or at least elevate the sniper-war genre. Instead, it inspired a wave of follow-up sniper movies that all pretty much flatlined. American Sniper stood out because of its emotional depth and Cooper\u2019s performance\u2014but even then, I didn\u2019t find myself wanting to rewatch it.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad film by any means. It\u2019s likely a powerful experience for many viewers. But as someone who prefers a bit more action, visual storytelling, and creativity without needing too much exposition, it just didn\u2019t fully resonate with me. I want a film to pull me in\u2014not feel like I\u2019m doing homework just to stay engaged.",

    "text": "This is a film that is showing the duality of a man's life. It is showing his life before the military, and then how his life develops throughout his tours in Iraq as a Navy Seal sniper. Throughout the movie you see all of the things that happened to him while he is over there, and all of the people he lost and how that affects him when he gets back to his wife and kids. Eventually you see his PTSD come into play, though he still chooses to fight for his country rather than retiring and not finishing his tours. You see the strain this choice takes on all of his relationships especially with his wife and it makes you question why he is doing this, and if it will all be worth it in the end. I think this is one of the best films ever put out to this day. I think this to be true, because it is so amazingly filmed and edited. But also because there is such a beautiful story and message behind it. I also greatly admire this film because it is based off a true story and is a tribute to a very real person who experienced these situations. You can tell they put so much effort and time into this film and were very close with detailing. They didn't just throw it together quickly and make it just any military movie, they really made sure the message was clear. They made sure that the emotions and tension were felt through every viewer, I've seen this film countless times, and every time I still cry at the ending because of how they filmed it with such grace, while also keeping the story as true as possible. There is also such a beautiful and heartwarming tribute at the very end of the movie for Christopher Kyle, who the movie is based off of.",
