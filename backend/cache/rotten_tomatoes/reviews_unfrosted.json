But the jokes just don't land.  Amy Schumer was as good as she's ever going to be in a film, but the comedic tone was in trouble from the start, given that she was a good casting choice for what they were going for.  \n\nHow could Jerry Seinfeld's comedic sensibilities shift so far from being funny?  For someone's sense of humor this had to be hilarious, but even as a middle-aged dad who finds things funny because they're not funny it all didn't work.",

    "text": "Ever since the (hilarious) show Seinfeld, Jerry Seinfeld has been on a mission to tell us that we are too emotional. That we're all too serious by packing all those feelings and meanings into our work. And, while many comedians can lament on the challenges of their life, Jerry cuts corners and tells us his own life was mostly run-of-the-mill. While nobody can say that Jerry isn't pure class, it always feels a step too far to hear him constantly refuse to yield to the impact of emotions in our lives. \n\nJerry doubles down on the notion that our feelings are invalid by promoting the theory that there's some sort of comedy \"gene\" in many of his interviews. It's not the trauma and suffering that plays a big role in molding someone's sense of humor, it's some sort of gene that you're either born with or you're not. A very dangerous notion, especially in an age where there's a very real chance that humanity is falling backwards into barbarianism.\n\n\"Unfrosted\" is just that. Not sweet. Uninspiring. Bland. Like the cereal your parents made you eat to keep you healthy, but did a bad job selling the idea to you. Jerry Seinfeld just wants to make a movie. Like a stoic who just wants to design greeting cards. \n\nAll the cameos in the world can't save this movie from it's deliberate irrelevance. \"It's just a movie\", I can hear Seinfeld saying.",
