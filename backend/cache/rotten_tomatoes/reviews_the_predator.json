People give AI a bad wrap but I'm sure a basic AI bot could write a better screenplay 3 minutes. If you stop to think about anything for more than a second it completely falls apart, like the fugitive is on earth to save everyone, yet he crash lands and immediately starts taking trophy's. The upgrade predator is seemingly impervious to damage yet in the end he gets shot and dies. The ending is one of most embarrassing things I've ever seen, felt like I was watching an asylum movie or something directed by Roland Emmerich, truly awful",

    "text": "I expected to dislike this film a lot more. Yes, the story isn't the most compelling, the characters can be shallow and/or very unlikable, the score is pretty weak in my perspective, and it doesn't really give us anything too new or interesting to set it apart from the rest of the franchise. It's pretty forgettable, not very impactful, and bland. Easily my least favorite film in this series. But, it still has some good moments. Particularly, some of the action scenes, which benefit quite decently from the mostly solid effects.",

Shane Black. \n\nThe movie starts off strong; giving nods, and references to the first two movies. Then slowly wanes as it goes on. The comedy elements could have been better or not done at all. Aliens want autism ? Predator dogs? Personally I think this movie would have faired better in a war setting than in a suburban town and forest.",

But those moments can\u2019t save the sloppy pacing, cringe-inducing humor, and messy editing. It\u2019s a frustrating low point for the series, lacking the focus or thrill of its predecessors. The Predator is a forgettable mess that even diehard fans will struggle to defend.",

So frickin lame and once again they should be embarrassed.",

    "text": "Highly entertaining. Added this one into my go-to movie collection. Absolutely loved this movie! I loved the way the predator (the fugitive) has so much cheekiness about him and how quickly he learns power play from humans.  He has a wider range of emotional responses, I was even almost ready to see some personality development on this predator. I also found the overall body and armor design terrific . Felt thoroughly sad about him being killed so easily by the overgrown one. That was a silly waste of material and potential. Should have joined the humans in the final battle and then the defeat of the overgrown predator would not look so implausible. The human characters, surprisingly, did not come across as annoying. Thiss tory is fresh but stays true to the lore. Anyway, I loved the movie.",
