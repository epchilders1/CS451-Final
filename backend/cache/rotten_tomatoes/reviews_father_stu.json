Much appreciated.",

Sure, there are some qualities worthy of admiration in Stu, and the movie tries to highlight them as best they could, but it\u2019s hard to overlook the Hollywood flair lurking in the drama.",

    "text": "The film starts off intensely by showcasing the troubled relationship between father and son, marked by excessive pressure. Early on, the death of the brother occurs\u2014it wasn\u2019t clear to me whether he was the older or younger one, but that didn\u2019t affect my experience.\n\nMark Wahlberg plays Stu, an aggressive man who finds his light in fighting. However, a health issue prevents him from continuing in sports, leading him to pursue an acting career. Amid struggles and conflicts, he meets a woman and decides he wants to marry her.\n\nThen comes the second major obstacle in his life: he gets hit by a car. This event changes everything because it is at this moment that he finds God. From that point on, Stu gives up everything, including marriage, to follow a new purpose.\n\nThe third challenge arises with a disease that initially affects his hands but gradually takes over his entire body. Even as he progressively loses his ability to move, Stu remains steadfast in his faith and purpose, making his journey even more inspiring.\n\nThe film\u2019s direction ties everything together emotionally, showing how the people he clashed with eventually support him and how, in a blessed way, he manages to reunite his family.\n\nMark Wahlberg Gives His All\nHe fully immerses himself in Father Stu\u2019s transformation, both emotionally and physically.\n\nHis physical change throughout the film is shocking\u2014if it was achieved through special effects, it\u2019s incredibly well done. But if it was the result of the actor\u2019s dedication, he deserves more than just applause.\n\nHe conveys each phase of the character\u2019s life with 100% commitment.\n\nMel Gibson Is Also Excellent!\nHe plays Stu\u2019s father, a tough man filled with resentment.\n\nThe way his performance evolves\u2014from a distant and harsh figure to someone vulnerable and redeemed\u2014adds even more emotional weight to the narrative.\n\nThe Film Moved Me\u2014It Made Me Cry\nFather Stu was someone who, despite all the hardships, showed that every person has their own battle, mission, and cross to bear.\n\nAnd, as Chico Xavier said\u2014aligning with my Spiritist beliefs:\n\n\"Wherever the name of God is spoken, good can be done.\"\n\n\"We are human beings having a spiritual experience. And we are spirits having a human experience. - Father Stu",

Sad that the movie industry gatekeepers hate on any movie with some religious heart.\n\nThis is an undeniably good, not great film.  Wahlberg and Gibson are great and the journey of Stu is a story of redemption and reconnecting with family after tragedy.\n\nMost Americans will enjoy it.",

The performances were fantastic- I really didn't know Mark Wahlberg had it in him.   He changes so beautifully throughout the film.   Mel Gibson was a joy to see again, it was a great role for him.    I see that the film might be slightly too long, and it may meander a bit- but finishing this film is worth it.    I'm not a religious person, but I was in true tears.    Emotional, spiritual, uplifting, and very funny.",

    "text": "Critics hating a movie about faith with Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson. Shocking. \n\nIt was a great movie with a beautiful story. Couldn't make it through this one without tears. It was very well acted and fearless in its' message. \n\nA lot of faith based movies can be so poorly done and this one was excellent. The cast was great, Wahlberg really stepped out of his comfort zone here, and Gibson is riveting as always. \n\nIt was a tough watch and I think it's a one and done for me but I just came upstairs while my wife was watching it (3rd time) and felt compelled to write a review. Here's to hoping we can get more faith based movies that aren't the equivalent of lifetime specials.",

If Mark Wahlberg reads this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make more movies like this.  Those artsy etherial movies that are up for Oscars these days are garbage.  We need more of these real life honest stories of people who are bringing a positive influence and showing what being the best of yourself can do for everyone.",

I kept waiting for something to start driving the plot but it never really happened and I didn\u2019t like the sound (music) or look (too many close-ups) of it while waiting for something to drive the plot. The fact that the plot was based on a true story did make it intriguing enough to keep watching until the plot finally became driven by something more, other than the characters dialogue, in the final thirty minutes.  I think I see the contrast and change they were aiming for but... it just didn\u2019t do it for me.",
