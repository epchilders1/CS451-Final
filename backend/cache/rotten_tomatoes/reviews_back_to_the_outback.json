    "text": "Underrated animated movie. It's extremely funny and has a ton of good lessons and heart at the center of it.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me, and could ruin the movie for some people, is a scene where they destroy a nest in order to cross a river or something. I mean, this is a movie about lost family and family in general; these characters are all like orphans or once lost children. You would think they would be more compassionate and careful when it comes to those eggs and nest. It kind of goes against all the good messages the movie is showcasing.\n\nI still recommend it tho, if you ignore that quick moment i mentioned.",

    "text": "Bright, well-paced, and entertaining. We really enjoyed this movie. The plot is simple and the characters are easy to root for. Visually the movie is vibrant and well put together. The ONLY reason I wouldn\u2019t give 5/5 is because of the few (I mean few) adult sexual innuendos that are sprinkled in. It\u2019s  not egregious, but it just doesn\u2019t have a place in a children\u2019s film and doesn\u2019t add anything to the movie. But overall, it\u2019s an excellent kids film that I think is a hit.",

    "text": "Back to the Outback is the cinematic equivalent of soggy toast\u2014bland, uninspired, and utterly forgettable. It desperately wants to be a heartfelt adventure about misfits finding their place in the world, but instead, it delivers a painfully predictable storyline with jokes that land about as well as a faceplant onto concrete.\n\nThe animation is generic, the characters are walking stereotypes, and the emotional beats feel so forced you can practically hear the script begging you to care. Even the \"message\" about not judging a book by its cover is drowned in uninspired execution and a lack of originality.\n\nThe villain is laughably one-dimensional, the dialogue is filled with tired pop-culture references that will age like milk, and the pacing drags so much that even kids might lose interest. It\u2019s a movie that exists, and that\u2019s about the best thing I can say about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a charming, animated adventure, watch Zootopia, Madagascar, or literally any other movie that does this concept justice. Back to the Outback belongs in the cinematic wasteland, never to be revisited.",

    "text": "A pretty decent movie, although it promotes the idea that dangerous Australian animals are safe to touch and pet. The movie itself is pretty sweet, but the concept of \"Don\u2019t worry, they may be deadly, but they\u2019re nice! I swear!\" just seems a bit dangerous to me. Any dumb tourist could see a potentially venomous snake or spider and try to pick it up because a movie said it was ok. That aside though, I like the designs, and Nigel was really cute.",
