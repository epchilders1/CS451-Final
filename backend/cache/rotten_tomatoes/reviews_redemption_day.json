    "text": "They kidnapped the wrong wife.  So this is about a Marine Captain (Gary Dourdan).  His archeologist wife (Serinda Swan) travels to Africa to excavate a site on the Moroccan-Algerian border only to promptly get snatched up by Algerian insurgents.  It's not standard hostage negotiation policy, but who can stop a Marine from trying to save his wife?  Now, this was yet another movie that I went into pretty cold.  I knew that it had Andy Garcia in the cast list, but after Passengers, that doesn't exactly mean much.  I couldn't get a gauge on if this was a war movie or a Taken situation going off of the plot description.  Well, the answer falls somewhere in between the two, but unfortunately, it is highly generic.  Now I don't have a lot in the way of positive things to say about Redemption Day.  If I had to say something nice about it, I would say Gary Dourdan is trying.  You can tell that he thought this was going to be a decent-sized break for him, and for what it's worth, it's cool to see a person of color in the role that would traditionally go to a bulky handsome white man.  While he may be getting an A for effort, the rest of the cast, not so much.  The acting is a bit shaky, and the story had already mostly lost me before I was out of the first half.  There's just not that much happening that is engaging.  The script is lackluster, the direction is not terribly competent, and there are no new ideas brought to the table.  There's sloppy exposition as this is getting set up, like making Ernie Hudson say, \"Look, I'm your father.\"  Not to be insensitive, but the insurgents are just the standard brown villains that you get in every one of these movies of this type, only this time they are from northern Africa instead of the Middle East.  They don't have any personality other than to be intimidating, and they don't have an end goal other than to extort money from the U.S. government because a citizen accidentally put a toe on Algerian soil.  Redemption Day is not a prime-time film, and it is just barely a B war movie.  It is simple enough to follow, but you're not going to care because you have seen it all before.  The setup is weak, and when this eventually and inevitably turns into Call of Duty, I was more than ready to cut this off.  I do give minor points for Dourdan, but he does not have a lot to work with here.",

    "text": "Wow, this has to be a world record. On IMDb, Out of the current 1,004 reviews, 882 are all 10/10's - that's over 80% of the reviews, which is the biggest joke and deceit any filmmaker has made. This film should've been called Desperation Day. Rotten Tomatoes' *real* Top Critics' honest 16% Rotten score is much accurate lol.\n\nNewb director Hicham Hajji, also wrote, along with two other writers, the worst screenplay I've seen in a long time. It was riddled with plot and technical issues, convoluted, ridiculous, and filled with long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, and the slow pacing made the 99 min runtime feel like 3+ hours. What was even the point of the flashbacks? They were a waste of film. Was this even edited? And it's not like we haven't seen this type of film before. We have, and they've all been much better. This action thriller had slow awkward action, it was stale and utterly generic and low-rent, with no surprises or any real thrills. Hajji's camera work was also horrible - a 5th grade drama class could've come up with a better production. Instead of wasting time with these bogus reviews, he maybe should've had his screenplay reviewed and edited properly by a seasoned writer. Film school should be his next project. You can always tell the quality of what's ahead in a film by the sound and score. Right from the start, you hear this loud, overbearing, unfitting and annoyingly non-stop score, that it made the dialogue barely legible.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities was the beautiful set landscapes, and the casting that performed fairly decent, considering they probably had zero cast direction from Hajji. My very generous 4/10 all goes towards those few qualities. It's a big \"no\" from me.",
