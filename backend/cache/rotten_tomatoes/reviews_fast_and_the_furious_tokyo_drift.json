    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" (2006) is a must see F&F film for fans of the franchise. Filled with good performances from all of the cast that were and still are mostly unknowns, good story and solid storytelling, this chapter truly delivers. Being a first directing effort in the series by Justin Lin - \"Tokyo Drift\" captured what I personally have truly wanted from this series at that point - an involving story, fast cars, different approach to races, interesting characters. I truly believe that \"Tokyo Drift\" is the second best chapter in the franchise after superior \"Fast Five\". It delivers on every aspect. I saw it more times than any of the film in this series just because this movie is first off all about something more then just fast cars - it has a true and real plot, with main character I did care. Sure, it is simple as it goes but the underdog stories are something i really dig. \n\nOverall, \"Tokyo Drift\" is truly a simple yet great entertainment all around for me personally. It has everything that one can expect from the series without space travel - a really involving story first.",
