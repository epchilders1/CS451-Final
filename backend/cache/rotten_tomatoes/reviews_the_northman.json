    "text": "A Vengeful Epic That Drags.\n\nThe Northman is a punishing Viking epic that overwhelms with brutal realism, but its relentless grimness and repetitive cycles of violence blunt the mythic power, leaving a saga more exhausting than exhilarating. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s Amleth broods with intensity, but the narrative\u2019s unyielding march\u2014raids, visions, betrayals\u2014stifles emotional breathing room, making the 2022 historical trend feel more slog than spectacle. Nicole Kidman\u2019s fractured matriarch and Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s cunning ally tease complexity, but their roles are sidelined in the blood-drenched haze. Eggers\u2019 visceral craft, from volcanic rituals to shadowy cinematography, enchants, but the pacing falters, failing to elevate fate\u2019s tragedy beyond a cycle of fury. What could have been a profound Norse meditation devolves into a mud-soaked endurance test, a near-triumph marred by its own unyielding ferocity.",

It's not the genre of movies I'm very familiar with, I mean I don't usually watch smth of these sorts, but I could not help myself but watch it because of the cast. The entire movie is based on the novel and it tells a story of the man who lived in the medieval ages who seeks revenge and what he is ready to do for it. I really enjoyed it.",

I was so excited about this I bought it without seeing it on streaming... normally I love these kinds of movies... this was an \"ok\" idea with horrible execution. It now sits in a pile of movies I'll watch once and never again.\n\nThe performances were fine. The writing just... sucked.",

    "text": "The Northman is a visually striking and brutally ambitious film, helmed by director Robert Eggers, who once again proves his mastery of atmosphere and tone. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd delivers a powerful and deeply committed performance, fully embodying the rage and raw physicality of his vengeful Viking character. From the opening frames, it\u2019s clear this is a movie made with precision and passion \u2014 every shot feels meticulously crafted, every detail steeped in authenticity.\n\nFrom a cinematic standpoint, the film is nothing short of spectacular. Eggers captures the brutality and mysticism of the Viking world with an almost operatic intensity. The production design, costumes, and breathtaking landscapes all come together to create a fully immersive experience. It\u2019s a visual triumph that balances primal violence with haunting beauty. On a technical level, The Northman succeeds in every sense, elevating itself beyond the typical revenge epic.\n\nThat said, while I can appreciate its craftsmanship, the movie didn\u2019t completely work for me on an emotional level. It\u2019s heavy on dialogue and introspection, often prioritizing mood and mythology over momentum. The pacing can feel slow, and the story occasionally gets bogged down in philosophical exchanges that, while thematically rich, sap the film of the visceral energy that audiences might expect from a Viking revenge saga.\n\nThe screenplay, though thoughtful, could have benefited from tighter storytelling and a stronger balance between action and character development. There are moments where the dialogue feels overly stylized, creating a disconnect between the viewer and the raw human emotion at the film\u2019s core. Instead of feeling fully immersed in the journey, I often found myself waiting for something to happen.\n\nStill, it\u2019s impossible to deny the artistry behind The Northman. Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s performance, combined with Eggers\u2019 direction, gives the film a mythic power that will resonate deeply with certain audiences. For those who appreciate slow-burn storytelling, historical realism, and symbolic depth, this film is an unforgettable experience.\n\nUltimately, while I respect The Northman as a cinematic achievement and understand why it\u2019s beloved by fans of the genre, it didn\u2019t quite connect with me personally. It\u2019s beautifully made, but its deliberate pacing and dialogue-heavy structure kept me at a distance. A stunning film on a technical level \u2014 just not one that left me emotionally moved or eager to revisit.",
