Plus, the story is pretty dang cute. Chris Evens does a fantastic job. McKenna Grace was absolutely perfect for this role. Heck, even Frank was incredible.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Hay pelis que te dejan con una sensaci\u00f3n de 'qu\u00e9 mono todo', \u00bfsabes? 'Un don excepcional' es de esas. Marc Webb se aleja de los superh\u00e9roes y nos trae una historia sencilla, pero que te toca la fibra. Un t\u00edo normal y corriente, Frank, se hace cargo de su sobrina, Mary, que resulta ser un cerebrito de las mates.\n\nLo mejor, sin duda, la qu\u00edmica entre Chris Evans y la ni\u00f1a, Mckenna Grace. Es que se nota que se llevan bien, que hay feeling. Evans se olvida del Capit\u00e1n Am\u00e9rica y se mete en la piel de un tipo normal, con sus rollos y sus miedos. Y la ni\u00f1a, \u00a1qu\u00e9 decir! Es un prodigio, pero no de esos que te dan repel\u00fas, sino una cr\u00eda normal y corriente, con sus gracias y sus rabietas.\n\nLa historia es de las de pa\u00f1uelo, no te voy a enga\u00f1ar. Pero no es de esas que te meten el drama con calzador. Es m\u00e1s de sonrisas tontas y de 'qu\u00e9 bonito'. S\u00ed, el debate sobre si la ni\u00f1a tiene que ir a una escuela especial o no se queda un poco en la superficie, pero a m\u00ed me dio igual. Yo estaba m\u00e1s pendiente de ver c\u00f3mo se llevaban t\u00edo y sobrina.\n\nVamos, que si buscas una peli para pasar un rato agradable, para desconectar y para salir del cine con una sonrisa, 'Un don excepcional' es tu peli. No es una obra maestra, pero es de esas que te dejan con el coraz\u00f3n calentito.\n\n(ENGLISH) You know those movies that leave you with a \"how cute\" feeling? Gifted is one of them. Marc Webb steps away from superheroes to bring us a simple yet heartfelt story. A regular guy, Frank, ends up taking care of his niece, Mary\u2014who turns out to be a math genius.\n\nThe best part? Without a doubt, the chemistry between Chris Evans and the young Mckenna Grace. You can tell they genuinely get along, that there's a real connection. Evans completely forgets about Captain America and plays an ordinary guy, dealing with life\u2019s ups and downs. And the kid? What can I say! She\u2019s brilliant but not in an annoying, precocious way\u2014just a regular girl with her quirks, tantrums, and all.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a tearjerker, I won\u2019t lie. But it doesn\u2019t shove the drama in your face. It\u2019s more about those little moments that make you smile and think, \"how sweet.\" Sure, the whole debate about whether Mary should go to a special school or not doesn\u2019t go too deep, but honestly, I didn\u2019t mind. I was more invested in watching the bond between uncle and niece.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a movie to unwind, something that leaves you feeling warm inside, Gifted is your pick. It\u2019s not a masterpiece, but it\u2019s one of those films that make your heart feel just a little bit lighter.",

Great cast and a live wire of a young actress who steals every scene she is in.",
