The only good thing about \"Curs>r Choose Or Die\" is the music that combines with the failed Matrix inspiration. This movie has a LOT to do to be bad. Avoid watching this garbage.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Elige o muere, parte de una idea prometedora , pero no termina de aprovecharla del todo, aunque entretener, entretiene. Su premisa, con tintes de nostalgia ochentera y un videojuego maldito que obliga a tomar decisiones extremas, daba para m\u00e1s. Sin embargo, lo que arranca con fuerza se va desinflando poco a poco, dejando la sensaci\u00f3n de que pod\u00eda haber sido mucho m\u00e1s.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula juega bien sus cartas al principio, generando una atm\u00f3sfera intrigante y algunas escenas con un punto de tensi\u00f3n bastante efectivo. Pero a medida que avanza, el guion se vuelve m\u00e1s predecible y cae en lugares comunes que restan impacto. No es que aburra, porque mantiene un buen ritmo, pero se nota que desaprovecha parte de su potencial. Hay momentos que parecen hechos a medida para construir una posible franquicia, aunque sin la convicci\u00f3n suficiente como para justificar m\u00e1s entregas.\n\nVisualmente, la pel\u00edcula tiene aciertos. Juega bien con la est\u00e9tica retro y algunos efectos funcionan, sobre todo en las secuencias m\u00e1s perturbadoras. No se excede con el gore, pero lo usa en el momento justo para reforzar la sensaci\u00f3n de peligro. Aun as\u00ed, hay un cierto aire de producci\u00f3n contenida que impide que el impacto visual sea mayor.\n\nEl reparto hace un trabajo decente, con Iola Evans al frente, logrando transmitir la angustia de su personaje. Y, por supuesto, la presencia de Asa Butterfield es un buen reclamo, aunque su papel no tenga tanto peso como podr\u00eda esperarse. En general, los personajes cumplen, pero sin demasiada profundidad, lo que impide que la historia cale m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su concepto inicial.\n\nAl final, Elige o muere es un thriller de terror que entretiene lo justo, sin arriesgar demasiado. Con una ejecuci\u00f3n m\u00e1s ambiciosa y un guion que explotara mejor su premisa, podr\u00eda haber sido una propuesta mucho m\u00e1s s\u00f3lida. Tal como est\u00e1, deja la puerta abierta a secuelas, pero sin una necesidad real de que existan.\n\n(ENGLISH) Choose or Die starts with a promising concept, but it doesn\u2019t fully take advantage of it. That being said, it does manage to entertain. Its premise\u2014filled with '80s nostalgia and a cursed video game that forces players to make extreme choices\u2014had the potential for much more. However, what begins with strength gradually loses momentum, leaving the feeling that it could have been something bigger.\n\nThe film plays its cards well at the start, creating an intriguing atmosphere and delivering a few moments of effective tension. But as the story progresses, the script becomes more predictable and falls into familiar tropes that lessen its impact. It\u2019s not boring, as it keeps a solid pace, but you can tell that much of its potential goes untapped. Some moments seem designed to set up a possible franchise, but they lack the conviction to truly justify more sequels.\n\nVisually, the film has its strengths. It makes good use of its retro aesthetic, and some of the effects work well, especially in the more unsettling sequences. It doesn\u2019t overdo the gore, but it uses it at the right moments to enhance the sense of danger. Even so, there\u2019s a certain low-budget feel that prevents it from having a greater visual impact.\n\nThe cast does a decent job, with Iola Evans effectively conveying her character\u2019s distress. And, of course, Asa Butterfield\u2019s presence is a solid draw, though his role doesn\u2019t carry as much weight as one might expect. Overall, the characters work but lack depth, preventing the story from resonating beyond its initial concept.\n\nIn the end, Choose or Die is a horror thriller that entertains just enough without taking major risks. With a more ambitious execution and a script that fully embraced its premise, it could have been a much stronger film. As it stands, it leaves the door open for sequels, though there\u2019s no real need for them.",

    "text": "Here we have yet another example of a thriller with a very nifty and potentially interesting premise that can't decide what to do with it. The set-up to this movie is quite strong and intriguing, especially for those of us who grew up with video games in the 80s. I remember specifically playing a similar choose-your-own-adventure type of game as CURS>R at my cousins' house during a family reunion. The concept is cool, but I could tell even before the halfway mark that the filmmakers had no idea what path to take. Blood and gore here are thankfully limited with a couple exceptions, particularly a scene toward the end involving hypodermic needles. Evans is a game protagonist, and if anyone ever makes a movie about Jimmy Fallon, they must cast Butterfield. The ending is an absolutely shameless open door for a sequel or series of sequels. By the one hour mark, I was so weary of trying to make sense of what was going on, that I felt exhausted. Tone and atmosphere are strong, but the finished product is yet another wasted opportunity.",

    "text": "I really like the retro-concept, much like Jumanji, but this is much more sinister. Curs<R is a great title too. The trailer looks great, but the actual film is just not put together well. It has some interesting ideas, such as the strange audio code affecting reality, but nothing is explored, as if this is the first of a franchise. The acting was great, it was just the script gave very little for them to connect in any way to the audience. Sadly, this was a bit of a disappointment.",
