Adventure, suspense, heartbreak, joy and lots of intrigue. What if the \"Have fun, save the ones you can save, and just be here now\" is really the purpose for us all? Highly recommended",

    "text": "A Dog's Journey is a heartwarming and deeply emotional film that explores the enduring bond between humans and their canine companions. While the plot may tread familiar ground, the film's genuine sentimentality, charming performances, and focus on themes of love, loyalty, and reincarnation create a powerful and moving experience. Be prepared to shed a few tears as you follow Bailey's journey through multiple lives, each filled with purpose and unwavering devotion.",

I am obsessed!!\nI would definitely recommend watching the first movie, A Dog\u2019s Purpose, beforehand, which is also great.\nI absolutely love dogs, and this film was the perfect one for me! The plot is amazing, the actors are great, it was just an amazing watch overall! I finished it all in a day.\nThe ending is so sad, it made me cry - don\u2019t worry, they were happy tears! Personally, i think it is much better than the first one, but I love them both! I can\u2019t wait to read the books.\nIf you want a great family movie, love animals/dogs, or are just looking for a good watch, I would definitely recommend these films!",

But in this movie the writer does the lazy thing 5 TIMES! In a Hallmark movie on crack. This whole movie could have ended an hour early if legal act was taken. Be the end of the movie you don't care at all about the characters or anything and you want to smash your fingers in a door repeatedly to ease the emotions wipe lish of a dog's journey.",

It is wn emotional roller-coaster. Its a great movie, not a Pianist or Shindler's list, but the move is great. Its good in what it suposed to be good at.",
