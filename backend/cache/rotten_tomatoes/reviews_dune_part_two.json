    "text": "One of my favourite movies. It's visually stunning, has a great storyline and has great acting from the main character. If you like sci-fi films, you'll love this. You'll need to watch the prequel (Dune part one) to fully understand this film. The first film isn't nearly as good as part two, but it does set the story up and I would recommend watching both. Overall 10/10",

    "text": "Dune: Part Two is the second installment in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s adaptation of the iconic sci-fi saga, continuing Paul Atreides\u2019 journey with the Fremen as he rises toward a destiny that both empowers and terrifies him. The film deepens the political and spiritual conflict surrounding Paul, as he embraces the path before him while Chani fears the consequences of what he is becoming.\n\nThe character development in this chapter is excellent. Paul battles the idea of an inevitable future, trying to hold onto what makes him human while learning to harness the power of the desert. Lady Jessica becomes even more strategically influential, pushing the narrative of Paul as the prophesied Lisan al Gaib and amplifying the dangerous expectations placed on him.\n\nThe supporting cast shines. Austin Butler delivers a chilling and twisted performance as Feyd Rautha, making him an unforgettable antagonist. Javier Bardem adds both weight and conviction in his role, portraying unwavering faith in Paul\u2019s rise.\n\nVisually, the film is breathtaking. The scale of the battles, the detail in the world building, and the stunning cinematography create a universe that is easy to get lost in. The visual effects elevate every scene, making the vast deserts and colossal sandworms feel incredibly real.\n\nBut the true standout of the film is Timothee Chalamet. His portrayal of Paul Atreides captures both the power he is gaining and the internal fear of what that power may turn him into. He brings a depth and emotional complexity that perfectly anchors the story.\n\nDune: Part Two is a gripping and visually spectacular experience that keeps you invested from start to finish. It is an outstanding continuation of the saga and a thrilling cinematic achievement.\n\n97/100",

There was one character gender change that will make it hard for a future movie in the book series and unless they do a complete rewrite they will have to change the gender of the character back.  Still a great movie and that issue will be a future writer's problem.",
