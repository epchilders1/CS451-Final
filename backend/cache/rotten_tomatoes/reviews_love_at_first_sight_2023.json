First watches I wasnt into the two subplots but on repeated watchings, Im good with both families story. Both sad but nice too. On my list of watch every so often- I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "This movie should definitely have been called Love at First Flight.\n\nLove at First Sight delivers exactly what it promises: it\u2019s light, entertaining, and easy to watch. However, it\u2019s also extremely basic and predictable, with no real attempt to break the mold or bring anything new to the genre. The script plays it completely safe, leaning entirely on the most typical romantic comedy clich\u00e9s. That said, it does have some charming moments and decent chemistry between the leads, which may be enough for viewers who just want to enjoy something simple without thinking too much. It\u2019s not bad, but it definitely lacks originality and the courage to stand out.",

But the problem is a lack of real laughs in its comedic attempts, and it's bereft of even these in its last third. This isn't good enough for a successful theatrical release, but worth a watch on a streamer...",

The story drags in the middle, making everything feel predictable and flat. It's okay as a time-killer, but not memorable. Best for those who enjoy light romances or have nothing better to watch.",

I literally cried towards the end because of the main leads story but it was so heartwarming and of course it ended with a happy ending!! just watch it i literally don\u2019t ever write any reviews but I had to for this one because it was great, not too cheesy and just the right amount of romance",

Hadley travelled super far from her father's wedding to his mother's memorial to meet him and he said something bad to her and he let her go. She was so miserable (phone out battery, didn't know how to get back) and he just sat there doing nothing. It was only thanks to Miss Narrator giving Hadley's backpack to Oliver that they met again, otherwise he would not have been there. After all those bad things he said to her, he just came to find her and then they were kissing... i was like what the..? i would have give this movie only 2 stars but the 1 bonus star is for Ms Narrator -_-",

It is a charming story with nice lead characters whom have very good chemistry and do it all with a clever script and very good acting. Pulls on the heart strings and makes you smile all in under 90 minutes. What else could you ask for.",
