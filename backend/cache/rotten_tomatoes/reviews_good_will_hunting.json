    "text": "Good Will Hunting is definitely a movie that still delivers the same emotional impact as it did when it was released. A story of a genius janitor is a headline that might get your attention, however, the film is mostly about pain, healing, and getting to know that love and help are not for people who deserve it but even for the ones who think they don\u2019t. Will, a clever yet emotionally lacking guy from South Boston is the main character whose life we follow. The main thing that makes this movie different from others is its plausibility. It doesn\u2019t glamorize any aspect or flaunt with extreme stunts but rather it brings the real people and their real problems to the forefront.\nOne of the best performances of Matt Damon is probably his role as Will. He does not only act but rather feels like one he is the real thing, the brilliance, the anger, and the fear. There is a very strong idea that behind his tough appearance more things are lurking and that\u2019s the reason why he is so much like the human himself in terms of identification. Robin Williams, one of my all time favorites, in the role of Sean the therapist is the one who basically dominates every single scene he is in. The way he slowly but surely wins Will\u2019s trust and then gets him to talk is very credible. Probably the \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault\u201d scene is the warmest moment of any film and my favorite scene.\nThe script which was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck very much resembles real life and looks like it was done spontaneously. In fact, the characters' dialogues in a movie are the manner in which real people say and not actors who have memorized the script. The film decides to be quiet without using it as a hint for more deep ideas. When Sean is telling Will on the park bench about life and love, it is the finest example of how life away from books is so much more than just getting knowledge from them. It\u2019s one of those things that don\u2019t leave your mind. The place and the music are quite supportive to the film too. The Boston location gives the film a gritty kind of authentic feel while Elliott Smith\u2019s music is perfect for the film. The songs are soft but very emotional and are in absolute harmony with the quiet parts of the movie.\nThe factor that actually makes Good Will Hunting an ageless piece is the message contained in it. This movie serves as a warning that being intelligent is almost worthless if you lack the courage to face your past or to share with others. It's a very strong and inspiring message, especially the part that shows Will choosing his life-changing path all by himself ironically at the end. This movie would be different from all other movies if its authenticity alone. It doesn\u2019t try to be what it is not. It\u2019s sad and both funny, while being easily relatable. The kind of story that keeps making you think about your own life long after you have watched it.\n-Luke Getz",

    "text": "Been so many years since I last saw this superb film. Robin Williams was a genius on screen. Listening to his words you believed his pain and perhaps it now takes on more poignancy given we know how that ended for him. There are certain scenes that just stayed with you through the decades. The bar scene where Will confronts the arrogant Harvard students, Robin Williams describing the night he first met his wife are just two. Ben & Matt definitely hit it out of the park when it came to this script and backed it up with their performances as did all the cast. A beautiful film and I now feel I need to rewatch Dead Poets Society as that\u2019s been too long since I last saw that.",

    "text": "A masterpiece about friendships, Therapy, potential, and the beauty in imperfections.\n\nComing from the minds of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting is a deep dive into what it means to be a unique individual in a world full of imperfections. From the rivalry of two great minds, one choosing greatness while the other choosing passion and love. It delves into a great mind that can see calculations without even knowing anything about them. It takes great inspiration from the historical figures like Beethoven and Tesla that saw something no mere human could ever! \nWith the exploration of the Human mind also comes the broken parts that are the focus of this film. It discusses very human topics like broken minds, healing, loss, and imperfections. Every single actor did a great job playing their parts, but Matt Damon with Robin Williams genuinely brought tears to my eyes. Seeing their chemistry, both the greatest minds being tested but life and lost, is something I have never really seen in a film being discussed this beautifully. \nI honestly loved the metaphorical dialogues and relationships between the characters and the subtle roles they play in each other\u2019s lives. The writing is just beautiful and heartwarming, and seeing Robin Williams talk about emotions never gets old. No one is perfect, but what matters is if you find your perfect friend/partner, the one who sees what you don\u2019t see in yourself. Just like how Matt saw calculations as child\u2019s play but couldn\u2019t see his own broken mind, where others could sense it so clearly.\n\nPROS:\n-\tEmotional Deep writing.\n-\tRobin Williams\u2019 brilliance.\n-\tGreat dialogues and chemistry.\n-\tHuge rewatch value.\n\nCONS:\n-\tHonestly couldn\u2019t find any. It is generally a really good film.\n\nSCORE: 10/10",
