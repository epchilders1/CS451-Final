WIth notable actors like Kimiko Glenn, James Marsden, Ken Jeong, and Vanessa Hudgens, the characters were very interesting and entertaining as well. The movie has a serviceable plot, with a few here-and-there's that could be tweaked. A hilarious, kind-hearted film with a nice little moral to wrap it up nice and tight for all families to enjoy.",

It's changed everything of the original My Little Pony. And it literally says that the ponies hated each other, even though the series already did that and solved it...  and how did Sunny turn into a alicorn so quickly? It's just a bad storyline... and it ruined my childhood. It should have been the Mane 6.",

    "text": "This film, MLP: A New Generation botched the entire franchise of G4's continuation into the future, I get the concept of reuniting what once was broken hundreds of years back but it was executed so poorly, that it's offensive after years of what G4 can pull up after over a decade of its runtime as a series; just for G5 to botch up the lore of the film once again with barely any substance within. As I watched the film carefully, what I could say, is it's UNNECESSARY to make G5 look 3D, not only that, it looks extremely uncanny if you wanted to make a good G5 film, at least make the style of the film not look like it tried to copy cheap looking knock-offs from other imitators.",

Kids will still enjoy it though because they're well.. kids. But people who HAVE watched mlp before. Will not enjoy this movie.\n\nThe plot is weird and boring. Not to mention dumb and unnecessary. There isn't even a real reasoning behind it as to why all the ponies don't have their natural abilities anymore. And there's no insight as to what had happened. The movie is terrible and so is the series. Don't recommend this movie to ACTUAL fans of mlp.",
