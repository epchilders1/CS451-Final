E este filme temos Pete (Douglas) tem que provar sua inoc\u00eancia que n\u00e3o esta tramando a morte do presidente (Rasche), mas para complicar o caso Pete esta tendo um caso com a mulher do presidente Sarah (Basinger) e este segredo que agora n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais segredo, acaba fazendo com que se complicasse e sendo suspeito, pois teria que esconder isso. E enquanto ele foge e tenta provar sua inoc\u00eancia, esta sendo perseguido por David (Kiefer) e Jill (Eva). E nessa corrida de ca\u00e7a ao rato, e cada passo que d\u00e1 o servi\u00e7o secreto esta l\u00e1. At\u00e9 descobrir que o verdadeiro traidor \u00e9 William (Donovan) que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 do servi\u00e7o secreto. E que tem um l\u00edder o leste europeu que esta por de traz de tudo. Um filme que n\u00e3o para do inicio ao fim. \u00c9 claro que tem umas facilidades, como deixar que Pete fuja por duas ocasi\u00f5es. Mas um filme que vc tem Douglas, Kim e Kiefer, \u00e9 legal de assistir.\nRoteiro e enredo um pouco confuso, mas ver atua\u00e7\u00e3o de atores  e pura nostalgia.\nVale apena assistir? Sim \nNota: 7",

Secret Service knows the bad guy but stars has to personally go there to stop them. Just a call would do it. \n\nEnding with 15 people surrounding the President and a bad guy walks up and grabs the First Lady was a perfect stupid ending for the rest of the stupid things. Little bad stuff is even obvious such as the good cop's gun uncocked as he goes to battle. Of course guns are easily knocked out of good guys hands and bad guys are walking malls shooting 15 people but walk away. Walking out a side door. \n\nWasted 2 hours watching.",

    "text": "If you haven't seen many thrillers/political thrillers than I guess I can see how someone may like this a bit more. But especially if your a fan of the genre this is the same Fugitive style plot you've seen done to death a million times now by the best of them. It's totally predictable how it will end and yet the actual conspiracy isn't so much convuluted as the movie just straight never really explains what it is. We know Douglas is being framed and using the First Lady affair as blackmail but we never find out really why or who these people are. And what is explained about the conspiracy is done so poorly. The villian is lame and barely in the film. We never see them interact either so it's hard to put a face to the conspiracy. The editing isn't good and is very jumpy with lots of speed up cutting in certain spots, slow motion that is blurry for no reason, and it just feels like stuff happens once he's on the run and cutting between K.S., the first lady, Dogulas, and the few times it cuts to the bad dude. And it jsut all collapses in the final 15 minutes or so. The pacing isn't good and everythign else is just alright. The actors are all trying and giving good performances but the characters aren't anything special, it's hard to get invested in any of them because there all pretty stock and the affair thing is so over the top it feels like too, to make up for a lack of in depth character. Direction isn't bad but and the music in the first half is pretty good actually. But it just feels like it becomes so bland and not used as well later. Skip This. It's basically The Fugitive style plot in a In The Line of Fire setting but not done anywhere near as well as those.",

Douglas is still a cheater in this movie but he's not a creeper like he was in \"A Perfect Murder\" or \"Fatal Attraction.\" We started 531 with so many creepy and offensive Douglas movies. He was good in the \"Ant Man\" series which have been watched but still kind of an asshole even there. So with \"Wall Street,\" it was a great Douglas movie/performance. This one is good too, or at least I think this movie is less boring and more exciting than other ppl but it doesn't hit 3 bag status 'cause Kiefer Sutherland is such an asshole in it! I like Don Sutherland better (see the Dirty Dozen, he was in that one). So let's hope for no more bad Douglas movies/experiences! Douglas has been on thin ice since this whole thing began...",
