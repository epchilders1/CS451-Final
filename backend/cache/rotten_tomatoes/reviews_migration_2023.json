    "text": "A complete embarrassment to Illumination.\nThe film's story feels like a complete rip-off of Rio and Chicken Run, which couldn't have been a coincidence because Chicken Run 2 was released around the same time as this film, at least in the US because this film didn't get released in the UK until 2024.\nThe characters are all forgettable, even having Awkwafina doesn't help justify it. (Although I love Awkwafina's acting.)\nThey released a short film to accompany this film's theatrical release called \"Mooned\" which shows what happened to Vector after the events of the first Despicable Me film, but I feel like they were using that to get people to buy tickets to a film that is not worth your time.\nAlso, it feels like this was rushed so Illumination could work mostly on the Mario Movie, because of the amount of forced creative decisions the film had.\nSo, in conclusion, Migration is an embarrassment to Illumination and a waste of my time.",

    "text": "[WARNING\u2014 SPOILERS]\n\nLogically speaking, my review would state that this should be 3/5 of the stars. Emotionally however, this movie does not resonate with me. On a personal level, I don\u2019t understand how people have found this movie enjoyable or how some of the critics did aswell but those are opinions that are not of me to judge. But here I am, posting a useless rant on a mediocre movie on a Croods (a much better movie than this one) like theme that I will forget in a day.\nFirst of all, Mack states that he has had his fear of flying since he was a child which falls under the category of a phobia. He never really portrays it however. Instead, when he finds out he will be alone if he doesn\u2019t, he immediately overcomes it with no doubt whatsoever. As a person who experienced a phobia before, this does not go away so quickly nor so efficiently. I understand this is a kids movie, but at least make it realistic. And the fact that this is coming from a child should tell the director something. I will leave this to your interpretation however.\nSecond of all, and forgive me if I am ignorant and missed the idea, there was no noticeable character flaw besides the fear that disappeared in a matter of two seconds. It wasn\u2019t like Grug who accurately displayed his emotions and got over them, it was more of a wild goose chase to get to Jamaica and have a Disney happy ending (no pun intended.) \nThe plot is also pretty confusing, like why is the chef so determined to kill the ducks? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all and there is no logic or reason behind his actions other than he wants to cook them. No chef looks at a duck, grins diabolically and thinks \u201cI waited my whole life for this and even chased you from a helicopter.\u201d It kind of dashes the whole point of the movie away.\nAnother thing I would like to mention is how the child is another typical \u201cI want to be a hero and save the day and wont let you stand in my way, [insert guardian name here]\u201d like all the other cliche tropes we have grown to forget. He never learns that he should stop and listen to his parent. Yes, he did a good job by saving the ducks. In fact, he did the correct thing. But his actions have left him and his father arguing over a concept the kid never learns to accept: staying safe and helping others have to work in a balance.\nThis report may represent a false projection of my actual being. I am open and quite optimistic and winning to give many things the benefit of the doubt much like the wife. Except that the wife is a bit too optimistic. She is a happy go lucky character with the survival instincts of that potato chip you dropped behind your couch. She also contributed nothing to the movie besides \u201copening the eyes of the main character to have no fear or intuition whatsoever.\u201d And like stated from the above, the children are worst.\nTo be quite honest, there is more I would like to say about this film but I have already forgotten the majority of the movie thanks to how unreasonably stupid and idiotic this was. However, this was quite bearable unlike most other horrible movies. You guys could have done better, but at least you put in the tiniest bit of effort into this. I hope this opinion didn\u2019t take a bad role into you guys and I hope no harm. Thank you for reading and remember that this is only but a drop of negativity in the sea of online rants. Have a nice day.",

    "text": "I recently watched this on my DVD player. I think it's quite good and it's too bad it flopped. (EDIT: No, it didn't, apparently it was a modest success. Not sure where I heard that.) It could have used a bit more dialog; it felt like a big constant action scene. Character arcs felt rushed. The mom was a little too competent, but became more interesting in the second half. Animation looked cool, exciting flying shots. Fact that it was mom and not spunky kid who wanted to migrate was nice departure from usually rebellion cliches. Son does rebel in second half, but it's to save others, so that's also not that cliche. Dad had best arc, learning to overcome fears was gradual and believable. Not \"Finding Nemo,\" but worth checking out.",

    "text": "Some say this film copied The Croods, but I liked it better than the 2013 film, as Migration had more things to like about than the movie centered on the cave family.\nOkay, yes, in Migration we do have the overprotective father who tells stories to try to get his kids never to leave the safety of home, but the film has many different plot points than just that trope. Migration reminds me a bit of The Croods, but then Chicken Run, but also just a classic vacation film. Which one is it? You can decide. All in all, it was one of Illumination's best films (nearly as good as Despicable Me).\nThe animation and music were great; the plot too. The characters were good also. You have teenage ducks having a bit of romance, a young duckling who is embarrassed to answer the call of nature while in the sky, an uncle who is grumpy but also has a fun side (a bit like Gran in the Croods, I guess), a street smart pigeon, and of course the chef, whose personality I still can't totally figure out, since he can't talk.\nThe Jamaica part was probably my favorite; the animation was the most beautiful there. I hope there's a Migration 2, because if there is, I'll be sure to see it.\nUnless I suddenly start hating animated films about birds, that is.",
