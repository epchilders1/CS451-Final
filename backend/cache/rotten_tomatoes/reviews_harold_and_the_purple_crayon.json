    "text": "You know something? On the one hand, it's nice to learn that one of the guys from the late Blue Sky Studios is still getting work. On the other hand, a film like this doesn't seem like the best place to utilise his skills as a director because Harold and the Purple Crayon is not very good. This isn't even his first live-action project. Carlos Saldanha had already directed a segment in an anthology film and created a TV show focused on his native Brazil. Save for VFX work from before Blue Sky transitioned to a professional animation studio, this is his first Hollywood live-action project. I can't help but wonder if this was more of a paycheck project for him. At least when other animation directors make a live-action film, it's because it was either a passion project of theirs or they wanted to make something out of their comfort zone. I fail to understand what caused someone at Sony to see this guy's work on the Ice Age sequels that people like and the Rio movies and declare him perfect for their film adaptation of a children's book from the '50s that's actually a meta-sequel. Even if we ignore the source material and judge the baffling premise on its own merits, it's still a clich\u00e9d low fantasy film with cringey fish-out-of-water humour and predictable narrative beats. Why they treated the fact that the author of the original book being dead as a plot twist is beyond me. Yeah, I don't consider it to be a spoiler despite the movie telling me it is because a quick Google search means that it's basically a waiting game for the characters to find out. It even comes off as outright confusing when you take the time period of when he died into account. Does time work differently in the Crayon-Verse or something? Reminds me of when the live-action Smurfs movie had them encountering their own comics. The film's premise even brought to mind that terrible Fat Albert movie from the 2000's but at least here, the focus on the real world makes some sense unlike that film where such an idea was redundant due to already being based off of a slice-of-life cartoon. Not to mention a poor man's Elf, right down to the casting of Zooey Deschanel, albeit as a character more similar to the father from that movie since she's growing too old to convincingly play Manic Pixie Dream Girl-type characters. Maybe a bit of an exaggeration there but, even without those comparisons, she's still playing a character type that's already been seen before as the struggling single mother who conveniently never witnesses all the whimsical stuff happening until the climax. Zachary Levi doesn't sell the manchild thing as effectively as Will Ferrell did back in the day. None of the three actors do. They just come off as embarrassing themselves. Lil Rel Howery comes off here as a poor man's Kevin Hart. I suppose there are still some good things however. The 2D-animated sequences are very fluid and easily the best parts of the movie, the scenes with the crayon are visually pleasing and Jemaine Clement's character is fun to watch and arguably has more sympathetic motives compared to our moronic hero who, to give an example, doesn't get in trouble for child endangerment. The simping for Deschanel I could do without but the man just wants to have his fantasy novel published. A bit pretentious and having self-insert elements but we do live in a world where simple tweaking to turn a fanfiction into an original IP resulted in a bestseller in its own right, despite hardly being a critical darling. And I do think the ending has its heart in the right place regarding the immortalising of an author's legacy. But this is fairly bland family fare which feels like a throwback to the live-action adaptations of IPs from the 2000s and early 2010s in all the wrong ways. Go watch IF instead. It's not terrific but it does have more on its mind with its depictions of childhood grief unlike the unfunny fish-out-of-water shenanigans here. And for the people who can't separate art from the artist, its stars, at least at the time I'm writing this, aren't controversial!",

Honestly, I forgot that this movie existed for a while, and even know, I've forgotten about half of it. \nThat's a problem with taking a children's book and stretching it out into a movie. You have almost nothing to work with, so the film is mostly filler. And I understand that I'm probably not the age range that this movie is looking for, but, come on. I probably only thought now or two things were funny. If you're looking for a movie to show your five year old kid, maybe set the bar a little higher than this.",
