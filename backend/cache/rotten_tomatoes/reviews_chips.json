It's not that it wasn't funny, it was funny in that way where I would say to myself in my head, \"that's funny,\" but I didn't actually laugh. Dirty Grandpa was another one that I found similar. I saw something else recent with Deniro that I had to turn off, but Dirty Grandpa I watched all the way through and thought it was good, I just didn't laugh. It was missing that one thing to carry it across.",

I would have loved to see a sequel.",

I've heard it's \"low-IQ\" and such, but as an aside, it's tightly structured, the leads have excellent chemistry and it's unabashedly poking fun at itself. \n\nAll actors involved, from Pena and Shepherd to the cameos, all have terrific lines and spot on delivery. \n\nThere's actually a story, but it's built upon the outlandish dialogue and unashamedly crass humor. The action is wonderful 80s style buddy-cop fare.\n\nIf you're dumb, or overtly sensitive or even a Debbie Downer, you'll think it's dumb. Nuff said.",

E lembrarmos de Chips do seriado que foi sempre s\u00e9rio e que curt\u00edamos nas noites dos anos 80.  Com Ponchelero (Erik Estrada) e Baker (Larry Wilcox). Quando voc\u00ea v\u00ea este filme voc\u00ea que assitiu os seriado vai se decepcionar. Porque n\u00e3o tem nada haver. Um filme exagerado em tudo e isso ultrapassa. Quando voc\u00ea assite Agente 86, Star Trek, Mister Magoo, Os Gat\u00f5es,... Voc\u00ea v\u00ea a similaridade com as s\u00e9ries. Mas aqui nada haver. O filme retrata um grupo de assaltante de carros fortes. E a quadrilha \u00e9 formada por policiais. E Baker e Ponchi para desvendar. Sendo que Ponchi \u00e9 um agente do FBI infiltrado e altamente tarado. E Baker esta meio separado al\u00e9m de ser atrapalhado. O filme pega fogo quando o filho de Ray \u00e9 decapitado e sua ir\u00e1 para a vingan\u00e7a. E chega ao final com a musica do seriado por 3 segundos. \nRoteiro e enredo um coco.\nVale apena assistir? n\u00e3o\nNota: 2",
