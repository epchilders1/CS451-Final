    "text": "Remember Sudden Death the JCVD vehicle which was basically Die Hard in a hockey stadium. It was a solid 90s action movie as JCVD faced off against Powers Boothe.\nAlmost thirty years later someone decided to reboot it with Michael Jai White. \nNow with Michael Jai White you generally know what you're gonna get a some questionable acting and some great action scenes. \nUnfortunately this has loads of questionable acting and lacks great action sequences.\nMichael Jai White is capable of good acting as some of his straight to dvd/streaming films have shown. He was even good in a minor role in The Dark Knight, but sometimes I feel like he needs a competent director to at least get him to act.\nYet he is not even the worst actor in this film which is the gauling thing. Michael Eklund really bad and the worst one is Gary Owen, as his character suppose to be like Marv from Die Hard 2. Frankly he's just terrible.\nI really had hopes of not being disappointed as Sudden Death as a film works and a new take could work but this is just terrible. \nNot even a JCVD cameo.\nAvoid.",

The comedic value comes from how bad the acting is, the predictability and the fighting scenes with Tarentino like blood scenes from people getting shot. If you want the cringiest film of the year it\u2019s here! Haha",

The choreography is amazing and entertaining. \nOverall 3.5/5\nIf you're bored and just looking for entertainment 4.5/5",

Yes loads of cliches, it\u2019s know that it wants to be die hard but can\u2019t get close. It\u2019s knows exactly what it is and it\u2019s enjoyable. Great use of a classic Star Wars phrase as well\u2026",
