Some would argue that this film is even better than the first. I'm not one of those people, because I prefer the laser-focused narrative of the original; however, I wouldn't say that this film is any worse. It is a master-class in action filmmaking!",

    "text": "No segundo cap\u00edtulo da saga \"John Wick\" (2014-2025), a franquia come\u00e7a a nos apresentar algo que veio a se tornar um de seus melhores aspectos: a energia de hist\u00f3rias em quadrinhos (mais especificamente, graphic novel) do seu universo. Todo o submundo existente dentro da saga \u2014 suas estrutura e regras sociais, sua cultura, seus personagens, sua hist\u00f3ria \u2014 me parece algo que eu veria em graphic novel adultas, como Watchmen, Constantine, V de Vingan\u00e7a ou Estrada para a Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o. Esse \u00e9 o trabalho de uma sequ\u00eancia: expandir e aprofundar a mitologia do universo do filme anterior. E \"John Wick: Um Novo Dia para Matar\" faz isso com excel\u00eancia, al\u00e9m de entregar mais um espet\u00e1culo de a\u00e7\u00e3o e viol\u00eancia.",

Not sure how to explain it but the movie sorta insists upon itself. Still good tho but has the least rewatch ability",

It\u2019s never not going to be good.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think that out of the 4 John Wicks, this could be the lowest.. but don\u2019t get it twisted.. this is a damn good movie. \n\nThis was the bridge that allowed the rest of the franchise to be built. Instead of a sub par sequel, we get a glimpse of just how big the John Wick universe is. \n\nLayer after layer, from the continental codes of conduct to the high table being established. \n\nThis is the movie where JW realizes, to get out he might just have to kill everyone.",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\nWhile i don't think that \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" (2017) is a better movie then a first part, here i'm talking about one of the better action films in recent years. I really enjoyed Chapter 2, it has everything a super action film should have - clear and descent plot, solid acting, superb directing and action scenes that do deliver. Sure \"John Wick\" plays more like a cartoon or a comic book if you start to think about reality of the movie - this is a fairy tale, but its a damn good one. \n\nAction scenes were superb, as good as in a first one. This film expands the universe of this \"assassins\" underworld and it does this well by not over exploring it. Also this movie was superbly paced - at running time 2 hours i wasn't bored for a second and highly enjoyed this action flick.\n\nOverall, while \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" doesn't achieve the greatness of \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" to deliver action film that leaves you exhilarated by the end, this is non less a very good action film for those who liked the first part and love good old \"shoot em up\" movies in general.",
