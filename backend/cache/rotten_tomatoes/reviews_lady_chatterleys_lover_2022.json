    "text": "I went to England to get the uncensored copy of this book in 1958 and found that it was still banned. I had to go to Paris for it, and have since studied it quite a bit. My favorite film version was the BBC serialization of the novel, starring Joelly Richardson and Sean Bean. I didn't care for the female actors in this new film, as I found them very unattractive. The endings always seem to veer from the book, but that is acceptable. I feel so sorry for D.H. Lawrence who never got any profit from this book and others because of censorship. He would be shocked to know that there are at least six film versions of his most notorious novel.  It took 30 years after his death to get the book published in both England and America. Now, everyone uses that notorious word that got the book banned.",

This one is superbly adapted and shows that all the status and money can never surpass the need for love and human connection. The acting is solid and shows maturity and depth, the costumes and scenery lovely, and the music compliments everything perfectly. It's interesting to see the similarity between that time period, just as the industrial revolution was starting and replacing manual labor, and now with the rise of AI and the erasure of knowing whether or not your job will be taken by a computer.",

    "text": "For all its visual beauty, cast chemistry, and solidly-crafted illustration of a crumbling marriage, we must not forget that this is first and foremost a romance, and in that regard it falls short in one vital aspect: its communication thereof with the viewer. The film seems to focus on the Lady's experience by removing its focus from her affair, but then forgets to accurately portray the steps leading to the leads' infidelity. Instead, the script attempts to verbally justify her actions afterwards \u2013 a verbose tactic in visual narrative that leaves its characters appearing flat and unsympathetic. Unlike Lady Chatterley, we the audience do not become acquainted with her partner-in-affair, nor with the affair itself; therefore, the romance is reduced to a montage of sex scenes, albeit satisfyingly steamy ones, and little more. What at first bite appears to be a delicious candy made out of all the right ingredients has a tiny hollow centre, a nearly complete product lost in assembly, a romance lacking in romance.",

The acting is fine and the costumes are lovely, but I don't like how specifically drawn the characters are. It is too long and a slog at times. There is a lot of walking and then more walking and it seems like we're running in circles. Final Score: 4.3/10",

I've always thought Emma Corrin was great, but now add Jack O'Connell to my list of great (and sexy) upcoming actors. The direction was spot on and the color palette, costumes and settings beautiful. Everything to like and enjoy with this movie.",
