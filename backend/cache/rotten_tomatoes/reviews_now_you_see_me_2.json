    "text": "Slow, clunky scene between Ruffalo and Freeman at movie's end was not a plus and there's a long, senseless scene earlier where the Horseman are being searched, one-by-one. Expertly hiding the item AS they are searched, the magician would (for no earthly reason) then pass the item AFTER the search was completed to someone who was next to be searched. Once the first Horseman had successfully hidden the item throughout the thorough search, wouldn't it make sense to hang on to the item? Instead of passing it on to risk possibly being found on the next Horseman to be searched? Oh well, those things aside, I enjoyed the movie well enough.",

    "text": "Now You See Me 2 is definitely a step down from the original, weighed down by an overcomplicated plot that tries a little too hard to fool the audience. It offers far fewer memorable moments, and Lizzy Caplan\u2019s character unfortunately doesn\u2019t add much to the Horsemen. Still, the premise remains fun, the action is enjoyable, and the great soundtrack makes it an easy, entertaining choice for a night in.",

    "text": "Now You See Me 2 is not as enjoyable as the first one and it's also pretty predictable.\n\nThe story is disjointed and somewhat predictable. Which means I didn't know what the story was going to be after five minutes, but I figured out everything a few minutes before their reveal, which is also satisfying at times. The dialogues are sometimes cheesy or they just don't fit there. That threw me out occasionally. The characters don't always follow a visible and understandable journey, which is caused by a plot twist that doesn't really make sense having seen some stuff before. Despite all this I think overall the tricks made sense more.\n\nThe cinematography is mixed, but I enjoyed that the camera movement kept the style without overusing the chaotic scenes. The lighting is good, but the framing not so much. There were some shots where I could just feel that they switched to digital. I loved the spinning shots though. The pacing is probably the main reason I was bored with this film, so I'd say the editing is something I disliked. The casting is still wild and the actors fit into their roles a lot more. The performances aren't too special.\n\nNow You See Me 2 is the definition of a mixed experience. It's not always entertaining, it has pretty good cinematography and the story is okay.",

Definitely a must see franchise that never disappoints! I hope there is a 4th movie in the works, I can\u2019t wait! The 1-3 movies are all 5 stars for me",

Chu\u2019s directorial style and the film\u2019s action-adventure-driven screenplay clearly steer the work toward the spy genre.",

    "text": "What a follow-up. The street magician taps into some latent water bending powers, Isla Fishers character got replaced by \"other girl character,\" who is pretty normal except for a Mary Poppins style \"bird pocket.\" Meanwhile the psychic meets the Yin to his Yang in the form of Woody Harrelson but with some chompers and a perm now, and Dave Franco I think got some banana related power. \nOh right Harry Potter was in this one too, but he hates magic now and is trying to kill the wizards. So he comes up with this ingenious plan to lock one of them in a trick safe, without removing their belonging, and then dumped it into the water... a magician... he put a magician inside a trick/illusion and just walked away, thinking it would kill him. Then a bunch of other stuff happened and it ended. Brilliant film. 6/10",

Por que os cavaleiros n\u00e3o se soltaram das algemas r\u00e1pidos? que nem eles fazem durante do filme, 2. como os 4 cavaleiros juntaram um monte de pessoas ao redor de Londres para a atra\u00e7\u00e3o final, sem o Daniel e o Michael caine saber?, por que se o Daniel e Michael, est\u00e3o a 1 passo na dos 4 cavaleiros n\u00e3o teve sentido ter a atra\u00e7\u00e3o final, 5. e no final, o morgan Freeman sabia de tudo e ajudou eles enquanto ele estava na cadeia e foda-se, 6. Ele perdoou o mark ruffallo por achar que ele teve algum envolvimento com a morte de seu pai, que nem foi mencionado no primeiro filme, o filme teve uma cena excelente que foi a cena de passar a carta de pessoa para pessoa no laborat\u00f3rio do maluco do caralho, com tudo isso, eu at\u00e9 recomendo esse filme, mesmo com alguns erros ao longo do filme.",

    "text": "Now You See Me 2 continues the story of the Four Horsemen with new conflicts and a fresh character, Lula, but falls short of the charm and magic of the first film. While the film offers fast-paced action and a polished visual presentation, it lacks the jaw-dropping tricks that made its predecessor memorable. The story feels rushed at the start and underdeveloped in terms of character depth, particularly for the new cast. Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s role as the villain feels miscast, reducing the impact of the conflict. Despite its shortcomings, the film still provides enjoyable entertainment and sets up curiosity for a possible third installment.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com) and  (English version : uwiepuspita.com)",
