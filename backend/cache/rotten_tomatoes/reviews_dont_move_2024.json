Great aerial views of the vastness of woodlands. Realistic performances by the cast playing the two major roles very well. Excellent sound and visual effects. Don't Move is brilliant in it's simplicity and keeping the audience hitched with it's relentless agitating.",

I would NOT recommend, you will wait for something to happen and nothing will and the dumbest stuff happens. Richard gets shot 4 times and can somehow still swim it\u2019s so dumb",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this movie.it starts off interesting but quickly becomes predictable and boring. I could guess how every turn of the story would go, and I want to be surprised watching a new movie. It's a slow burn, too slow.\n\nThe ending is, well, predictable as well. I don't think a serial killer would give someone this many chances. I would have loved seeing this play out more in the eyes of the serial killer. What's his drive? What's the story? The script isn't as psychological as many other movies out there, and it falls pretty flat.",

    "text": "Bro, it feels a lot like other suspense movies I\u2019ve seen. That was my first reaction watching Don\u2019t Move. The truth is, the film even tries to innovate in its theme\u2014and it does, partly. It brings tense scenes, moments where people with anxiety (like me) will feel rage, will scream. But that\u2019s not enough. The movie slips badly in the script. The cabin scene goes by in a flash. Well, of course\u2014it\u2019s not very long, and the film\u2019s pacing gives off a lazy writing vibe, as if each scene just \u201chappens,\u201d with no strong purpose. There\u2019s a lack of clear motivation from the killer, no backstory for the victim or the serial killer, and no explanation of how he got there: to the park, the cliff. Sure, with everything I pointed out, the film would need to be a bit longer. That weakens the whole experience.\nIt\u2019s not just about suspense or jump scares. It\u2019s about building tension with substance\u2014and Don\u2019t Move doesn\u2019t do that. Nowadays, a lot of what we see isn\u2019t about quality, but quantity. And that seems to be the case here: a movie with few actors, few locations, and probably a limited budget. Did something come out of it? Yes. Good? I don\u2019t think so. Watchable? Like all of them, yes.",

Wow! Bravo really. No backstory at all as to why he's doing all this or what he was going to do with Iris if all these things didn't happen, besides learning about a dead chic named Chloe. The actors did a good job, but seriously get real",
