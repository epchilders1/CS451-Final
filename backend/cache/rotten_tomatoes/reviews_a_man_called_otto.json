He wants to end his life and join his beloved wife, but the friends and neighbors he shuns give him new reasons to live. The actor playing Marisol was terrific and should be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress. I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks and hope he continues making movies.",

But this: well I can't think of a film with Tom Hanks that I haven't enjoyed. It had me hooked right from the beginning. A grumpy man with a backstory and his redemption through meeting a new neighbour had me transfixed. It explores love and loss through bereavement and illness and a man who thinks his life is over finding new meaning. It had me bawling my eyes out, and that is rare. This film is not just a film, it's an experience that is poignant.",

    "text": "A Man Called Otto is a heartfelt and authentic adaptation that manages to keep the soul of the original story intact. Tom Hanks brings his signature warmth and subtle humor to the role, giving a layered performance that\u2019s both grumpy and deeply moving. What really makes the film shine, though, is how well the supporting cast complements him\u2014each character feels lived-in and genuine, adding depth without ever feeling forced. It\u2019s a touching, funny, and beautifully human story that proves some tales truly can cross cultures without losing their heart.",

Sadly, this movie didn\u2019t just veer towards it, like the bus, it ran off the road and landed in the middle of Lake Schmaltz. \n\nIt felt as if it had been written by AI, with all the token minorities seemingly written in just to tick a box - and they were, of course, all tediously adorable and bearing no resemblance to any known human being.\n\nAlthough I readily shed tears at a genuinely moving story my eyes remained dry as the Sahara throughout. \n\nA clich\u00e9d and formulaic movie, cynically designed as a tearjerker, and the worst Tom Hanks movie I\u2019ve ever seen.",

The story of the movie was dramatic, tragic, and heartfelt. It's about a man that's troubled by the world and wants to end his life, but finds friendship and love and does anything he can to help them. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.",
