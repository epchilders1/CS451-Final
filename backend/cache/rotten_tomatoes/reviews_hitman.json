The missions are very well portrayed and Diana is well integrated. Everything that should appeal to a true Hitman fan. I've watched this film countless times and will watch it again and again because it's so well made.\n\nAnd what do I have to say about the negative comments? Haters gonna hate.",

Timothy Olyphant was a great pick for agent: 47 and played the part very well. His acting was definitely solid enough to carry the lead role. The movie had decent storyline and a good supporting cast with Olga Kurylenko as the sexy distraction from the action. Don\u2019t over think the movie and just enjoy it for what it is. After all \u2026 It is based on a video game.",

    "text": "Honestly, as far as video game movies go, Hitman is honestly just there. It doesn't do anything remarkably well or remarkably poor, it's just, at its core, a movie that exists. Timothy Olyphant does deliver a good performance (I didn't see bald Olyphant, I saw Agent 47), the action's fine and while there isn't a heavy emphasis on stealth, there is at least an in-story justification that there are people actively gunning for him. Can't say I cared much for the film's attempts to ship 47 with Olga Kurylenko. It felt rather silly seeing how a professional assassin like him does not strike me as the kind of guy in search of a girlfriend. Even without taking the source material into account, this didn't sit right with me. Of course, there are other absurd moments such as Desmond from Lost conveniently leaving the firearms loaded for 47 and a fight scene against his fellow hitmen that's never brought up again. But on the whole, Hitman is just another action movie that felt to me like it was gunning for the 24/Bourne crowd that only stands out because of the IP it's adapting. I wonder if the 2015 reboot is as absurdly bad as fans of the game say it is. Guess I'll find out soon enough. Why they kept this film's screenwriter for that film, especially since it was following the cinematic disaster that was Die Hard 5 (script penned by the same guy), is a mystery to me.",
