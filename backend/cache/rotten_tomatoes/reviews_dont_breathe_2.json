    "text": "Unlike the first one, this is more of an action film than a horror film. There are a few creepy camera shots at the beginning again, but then the whole thing continues more in the style of a hard action thriller. Still, the film is definitely entertaining once again. Stephen Lang, returning as the blind man, has a great presence and comes across as almost unbeatable here. There are also a few good twists again, but overall everything doesn\u2019t feel as cohesive as in the first film. I didn\u2019t expect it to reach the same level as the first one, but I still find it quite good and worth watching.",

After the triumph of the original, it's has hard to recreate the tension since it was done before and better before. That said, some exciting set pieces like the water ripples scene in the third act, the young actress was terrific and it's technically well done. It just can't overcome the script.",

It was suspenseful, gory, terrifying, emotional, gut wrenching and it definitely kept me on my toes. You could relate to the characters more, understand why they are the way, they are and feel their pain. Absolutely loved it! It was more than just a scary horror movie.",

So I was rather surprised when this film just jumped into a bunch of mindless action and gore.  Where is the plot?  Where is the character development?  About halfway through we actually get some of each, but it's too little too late.  And of course it doesn't help that what we do get is over-the-top cartoonish.  All that being said, I must admit Stephen Lang is fantastic in his role as an aging badass.  And despite the terrible dialogue given her to work with, Fiona O'Shaughnessy was also super hot as the evil mom.  So yeah, it was enjoyable for what it was.  But I would not recommend it.",

There wasn't much expansion on the original, even though the plot was different.\n\nThe Steven Lang character was just as forceful and creative.. I thought Madelyn Grace was good as the daughter(?).\n\nIs this the end of the series? If not, where are they going (plotwise) from here if there is a Chapter 3? \n\nNot inserting a spoiler alert at this point.",
