Pero dahil sa magaling na pagtagpi tagpi ng kwento, magugulat ka sa big reveal ng twists. Kumpleto sana ang kwento kung sinabi ang dahilan kung bakit ginagawa yun ng culprit",

    "text": "one of the worst ways i\u2019ve seen a movie reframe itself. once the perspective changes halfway through, the filmmakers don\u2019t trust the audience enough to interpret what is happening, so they literally show you everything again to make sure you understand. the ending spends so much time holding your hand on plot reveals that you already guessed 30 minutes prior.\n\nthis doesn\u2019t even cover how convenient and contrived the narrative is. it\u2019s a shame because there are some really unique concepts here that could have been interesting, if handled correctly. \n\nadditionally, this is one of the worst movie scores in recent memory. annoyingly repetitive, overly ominous and over dramatic.",
