There is nothing in this movie to enjoy whatsoever. Somehow, this is even worse than Hop (2011). At least Hop, as atrocious as it is, tried to tell a decent story. It failed miserbly, but at least it tried. Minions did not try to tell a good story at all. All it tried to do was make as much money at possible. At it succeded. You just can't have a movie starring yellow tater tots who can't even speak a human language. IT DOESEN'T WORK! 0/10. DON'T WATCH AT ANY COST!",

I really liked it because the characters are hilarious, mischievous, and always getting into trouble. The minions, with their silly language and clumsy but lovable behavior, are unique and super original.\n\nWhat I liked the most is that, even though they don\u2019t speak a real language, you can understand everything they mean. Their facial expressions, gestures, and actions are so exaggerated and comical that it\u2019s impossible not to laugh. Also, the story is simple but fun: the minions are looking for the most evil villain to serve, but everything always goes wrong, which makes the situations even funnier and crazier.",
