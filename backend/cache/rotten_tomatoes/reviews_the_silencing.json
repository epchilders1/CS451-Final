Other than that nothing blatantly unbelievable happened.\n\nTo get such poor tomato scores from the critics makes me wonder who\u2019s paying them.  To be honest, I doubt they even watch the whole film when their reviews are that far off.",

Wallis was stale and boring, much like her role in Peaky Blinders. Zahn McClarnon was underutilized. Was hoping for quite a bit more out of this movie.",

    "text": "This is a very solid and engaging small, independent crime drama. The strength of the move is in the performance. In particular, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is a very gripping as a loner whose life is broken any the disappearance of his daughter. How his daughter's disappearance ties into other disappearances of young women in the area is the question of the film. The movie is well Directed. The cinematography is good. The landscape makes for a great setting for this dark and well paced drama. The young woman who plays the Sheriff is very compelling. All the supporting cast are very good actors, despite being relative unknowns.",
