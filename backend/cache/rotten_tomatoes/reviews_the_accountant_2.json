    "text": "Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: Rotten Tomatoes finally joined the hotel-review scam club, because there\u2019s no universe where this movie deserves five stars. The first one was okay \u2014 good, not great. But this sequel? It\u2019s so terrible and so ridiculous that we literally started laughing because we couldn\u2019t figure out what the hell was going on. The movie itself didn\u2019t even know if it wanted to be a comedy or be serious.\n\nI\u2019m still in shock because the movie is just horrible. The acting\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad \u2014 and honestly, it\u2019s not even about the acting. The story feels like the writer was on some type of  strong drug when he typed this script.\n\nSo here\u2019s the honest review: from now on, when you read ratings, only trust the people who didn\u2019t give five stars. There\u2019s no way this was a five-star movie. It\u2019s a solid two-star mess with a whole lot of problems.\n\nThank you for your time. Thats my feedback.",

Nesse caso, por exemplo, foi uma bola fora. \"O Contador 2\" transforma o universo criado no seu antecessor em uma buddy comedy \u2014 algo que, em qualquer outra ocasi\u00e3o, poderia ter sido divertido, pois Ben Affleck e Jon Bernthal s\u00e3o ambos atores verdadeiramente engra\u00e7ados e compartilham de uma boa qu\u00edmica \u2014, mas o resultado \u00e9 algo, simplesmente, destoante demais do filme anterior. E ao final do filme, eu fui deixado com o amargo sentimento de que o interessante universo criado pelo filme original foi apenas desperdi\u00e7ado em uma com\u00e9dia gen\u00e9rica e facilmente esquec\u00edvel.",

Also there was no accounting done to figure anything out. The kid hackers were overpowered and it ruined the story for me.",

    "text": "This movie is horrible compared to the first. The great Christian Wolff, who was a lethal and stealthy genius, is now brought to slums and portrayed as a pathetic dork. His brother Braxton, who was like a ninja is now portrayed as an over aggressive jerk. The storyline is incongruent, has an excessive amount of redundancy, and instead of being an amazing triumph is more of a failed attempt at a mixture of comedy and action. I would not recommend this movie for those who appreciate good films.",

Does this film want to hold on to the seriousness and intensity of the first film or does is want to be a buddy action comedy? It has moments that are genuinely funny, but most of this story is far-fetched and unbelievable. Additionally, it makes giant leaps and is slow where it shouldn\u2019t be.",

    "text": "The first Accountant stood out because it felt original. It wasn\u2019t just another action thriller \u2014 it leaned into autism as the central framework for Christian Wolff\u2019s character, showing how his worldview shaped his skills, his discipline, and even his capacity for violence. The film was at its best when it treated his neurodivergence not as a gimmick, but as a way of building tension: how does someone who processes the world differently navigate both spreadsheets and shootouts? That uniqueness gave the first movie its hook.\n\nThe Accountant 2 throws that originality out the window. Instead of deepening Christian\u2019s inner world, it waters him down. His autism, once core to the story\u2019s tension, is now played for quirks, awkward laughs, or \u201csuperpower\u201d shorthand. The complexity is gone, and with it, the sense of authenticity that made the character compelling.\n\nThe sequel also drowns itself in excess. The plot crams in conspiracies, human trafficking, assassins, hacker teams, and family drama, but the through-line is lost. Where the first film was focused and character-driven, the second feels overstuffed and unfocused. Tonally, it\u2019s all over the place \u2014 veering between grim thriller, buddy comedy, and sentimental drama. Instead of sharpening the story, the constant genre-hopping undercuts the stakes.",
