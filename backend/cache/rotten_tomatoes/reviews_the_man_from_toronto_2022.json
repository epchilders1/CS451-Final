    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Hay pel\u00edculas que se ven con la misma facilidad con la que se olvidan, y esta es una de ellas. La mezcla de acci\u00f3n y comedia funciona a ratos, sobre todo porque Kevin Hart y Woody Harrelson consiguen sacar chispa de su extra\u00f1o d\u00fao, aunque la qu\u00edmica nunca llega a ser tan explosiva como promete.\n\nEl humor es irregular, con chistes que entran bien y otros que se sienten forzados. La trama se mueve entre t\u00f3picos del g\u00e9nero y persecuciones de manual, sin aportar nada nuevo. El resultado es una sucesi\u00f3n de escenas que cumplen con lo m\u00ednimo para entretener, pero que rara vez sorprenden.\n\nLa direcci\u00f3n de Patrick Hughes mantiene el ritmo, aunque todo parece demasiado rutinario. Hay momentos de acci\u00f3n simp\u00e1ticos y alg\u00fan golpe c\u00f3mico efectivo, pero el conjunto carece de personalidad. Lo que podr\u00eda haber sido una \u201cbuddy movie\u201d con car\u00e1cter se queda en una f\u00f3rmula reciclada.\n\nEn definitiva, es una comedia de acci\u00f3n ligera, apta para una noche de sof\u00e1 sin demasiadas pretensiones. Se deja ver, tiene alg\u00fan gag salvable y no aburre, pero tampoco destaca. Una pel\u00edcula entretenida y ya est\u00e1, de esas que desaparecen de la memoria tan r\u00e1pido como llegaron.\n\n(ENGLISH) There are films that are as easy to watch as they are to forget, and this is one of them. The mix of action and comedy works at times, mainly because Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson manage to spark some energy from their odd pairing, even if the chemistry never quite reaches its full potential.\n\nThe humor is uneven, with some jokes landing well and others feeling forced. The plot moves between well-worn genre clich\u00e9s and predictable chases, without bringing anything new. What\u2019s left is a string of scenes that barely meet the minimum to entertain, but rarely surprise.\n\nPatrick Hughes\u2019 direction keeps things moving, though everything feels routine. There are a few amusing action moments and the occasional effective gag, but the film lacks personality. What could have been a \u201cbuddy movie\u201d with character ends up as a recycled formula.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a light action comedy, perfect for a couch night without high expectations. It\u2019s watchable, with a couple of redeeming laughs, and it doesn\u2019t bore, but it never stands out. An entertaining film, nothing more, and one that fades from memory as quickly as it arrives.",
