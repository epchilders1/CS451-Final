But besides the amazing editing this movie had good action and for someone who\u2019s never seen the show or the comic this would probably be a huge shock in this movie. It didn\u2019t make a little sense when sometimes Spider-Man couldn\u2019t sense when it wasn\u2019t real but besides the minor issues this movie with Spider-Man finally getting a love one and someone new finding out who Spider-Man is was good.",

    "text": "Spider-Man: Far From Home tries to balance high-school comedy, romance, and post-Endgame heroism, but the story feels uneven and full of questionable choices. Peter Parker\u2019s decision to blow off a global threat just to go on a date with MJ feels wildly out of character and weakens the film\u2019s emotional weight. The writing often relies on convenient plot turns\u2014MJ admitting she was only interested in Peter because she thought he was Spider-Man, or Mysterio trying to kill Peter\u2019s classmates even after his cover is already gone. The humor feels forced and childish, and when the group believes they\u2019re about to die, their sudden confessions don\u2019t feel earned. Mysterio\u2019s drone technology is also under-explained, raising questions about how something so powerful could go unnoticed by world governments or other heroes. By the end, the movie seems to rewrite its own logic just to push the story forward, skipping a proper reveal of Quentin Beck\u2019s backstory as a former Stark employee. While Tom Holland and Zendaya have great chemistry and the European settings are fun, the weak writing and inconsistent tone make Far From Home one of the more disappointing Spider-Man entries\u2014entertaining at moments, but ultimately hollow beneath the spectacle",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nStylish and entertaining but a bit uneven, Spider-Man: Far From Home delivers plenty of laughs and spectacle, even if it sometimes gets tangled in its own web of world-building. As a post-Endgame epilogue, it\u2019s fun and fast-paced\u2014but lacks some of the emotional depth and focus that made Homecoming so refreshing.\n\nTom Holland continues to shine as Peter Parker, effortlessly balancing awkward teen energy with genuine heroism. Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s Mysterio is charismatic and visually stunning, though his arc ultimately leans more on CGI than character. The film\u2019s globe-trotting adventure offers some thrilling set pieces, but the constant shifts in tone\u2014from high-school comedy to high-stakes superhero drama\u2014can make it feel a little disjointed.\n\nDespite its flaws, Far From Home remains an enjoyable, good-hearted entry in the Spider-Man saga. It\u2019s not the tightest or most resonant web the MCU has spun, but it\u2019s still a fun ride that keeps the friendly neighborhood hero flying high.",

    "text": "I\u2019m not exactly sure what I am doing with these reviews for the post-Endgame Marvel movies.  I\u2019m not a Marvel fan boy but I have seen some of them and did parachute in for the finale films, around the time I decided I was mostly done with superhero movies in the theater.  Up until now, I hadn\u2019t seen any of the post-Endgame Marvel movies, other than Spider-Man: No Way Home but my Disney+ account was collecting dust so I queded up all the Marvel films since Endgame and finally found some time to view them. I\u2019m not sure of these reviews because my first time viewing them is as one and in the order of release after a re-viewing of the Infinite/Endgame saga, but here goes.... \n\nwhile not the biggest fan of this version of Spider-Man films, I felt this was a good follow-up to Endgame. The villain was a bit questionable and there was a bit too much Degrassi feel to it with more focus on the high school aged students than previous Spider-man films.  This basically felt like a filler episode, but a necessary one because there was no going bigger and outshining Endgame.  This was competently made and did what it needed to do, but it\u2019s definitely not going to endear itself upon the hearts of humanity.. or even casual Marvel fans.\n\t\nProbably could have been scored higher but I simply did not like it that much and there is a +/- 1/2 star chance of error for all my reviews.",
