    "text": "Yeah, it's \"Die Hard\" in a soccer stadium. It is almost comical how many plot points this movie \"borrows\" from the 1988 classic, all it's missing is having it take place during Christmas. But, in all honesty, it isn't a bad thing to be like \"Die Hard\".\n\nDave Bautista plays our John McClain for the film, and he does a good job. Bautista is a wrestler who has actually put in the work to become a believable actor. There are emotional beats in this film that he delivers very well. And the movie understands that in order for the story to work, our protagonist has to be vulnerable. And they do a good job of making Bautista feel like he is on the backfoot for the majority of the film.\n\nIf only the film could have rip offed the same sort of tight story telling. Great action choreography and top notch directing of \"Die Hard\".",

    "text": "A really well made (for it's budget) piece of Hollywood brought to East London and a movie that probably pleased the West Ham owners better than the \u2018Green Street' one did. \n\nLooks more expensive than it's 20million budget and the cast throws themselves into every scene. The story has as many holes as any single hero Hollywood movie, so it's best enjoyed with all sense of realism switched off.\n\nGains points for the starring role of the now defunct Boleyn Stadium that was at Upton Park. Worth a watch if a bout of escapism is required.",

    "text": "Der amerikanische Soldat Michael Knox (Dave Bautista) besucht die Tochter seines verstorbenen Kameraden in London und geht mit ihr zu dem Fu\u00dfballspiel West Ham United gegen Dynamo aus Russland. Arkady Belav (Ray Stevenson) h\u00e4lt das ganze Stadion als Geisel, um seinen f\u00fcr totgeglaubten Bruder Dimitri Belav (Pierce Brosnan) zu bekommen, um die Revolution f\u00fcr die Freiheit von Sakovya wieder zu starten. Michael versucht dies zu verhindern und seine Nichte zu retten.\n\nFinal Score ist ein typischer Actionfilm der sich nichts neues traut und seine Idee von der Kulisse eines Fu\u00dfballstadions nicht zu nutzen wei\u00df. Dave Baustista ist als Hauptcharakter gut ausgew\u00e4hlt worden und passt gut als Held in einen Actionfilm rein. Pierce Brosnan hat nichts zu tun, bis auf eine Motivationsrede, die zwar ganz interessant ist, aber die Motivation irgendwie nicht richtig erfasst. Wenn man ihn ansieht, guckt er nur in die Luft und redet nicht viel, obwohl man denkt, dass er mehr zu tun hat durch die Filmposter. Der B\u00f6sewicht, gespielt von Ray Stevenson ist der Klischee-B\u00f6sewicht und verh\u00e4lt sich wie die anderen B\u00f6sewicht unlogisch. So erschie\u00dfen Sie unschuldige Leute, aber die Nichte von Michael nehme sie nur als Geisel und tun ihr eigentlich nichts an. Generell wird die Kulisse gar nicht genutzt und wenn richtig unlogisch. So gibt es eine Verfolgungsjagd mit Motorr\u00e4dern innerhalb der Stadiond\u00e4cher, wo auch Kampfszenen stattfinden. Die Kampfszenen sind sehr stark geschnitten und am Anfang mit wackliger Kameraf\u00fchrung kaum anzuschauen. Die Computereffekte sind sehr schlecht gemacht, man sieht, dass einige Szenen nicht im Fu\u00dfballstadion gedreht wurden, sondern vor Greenscreen. Anfangs war der Film noch unterhaltsam und die beste Kampfszene war in der K\u00fcche, wo Michael leiden musste, um jemanden zu t\u00f6ten. Am Ende ist Final Score ein Film mit einer Kulisse, die auch auf einem Hochhaus oder anderen Kulisse stattfinden h\u00e4tte k\u00f6nnen. Der Film hat viele Logikl\u00f6cher, die im Actionfilm zwar oft zu finden sind und nicht immer st\u00f6ren, aber in diesem schon, da man das Potenzial nicht erreichen kann. Am Ende denkt man, dass der Film wenigstens Konsequenzen hat, aber dies ist aber nicht der Fall.\n\n\n6/10",

    "text": "Final Score is a knock off of Die Hard and Sudden Death staring Dave Bautista who acts as a former special forces soldier who takes his niece to the final soccer match of the year not knowing a group of Ukrainian terrorists are trying to take over the stadium. The terrorist group is headed by Ray Stevenson who finds out his own brother (Pierce Brosnan) who was not really dead but rather put in a witness protection plan. Unlike Die Hard where Hans was trying to steal bonds and gold, this one was trying to bring his brother back into the fold and on the same level as Sudden Death with Jean-Claude when the final stoppage of play the arena would literally blow up. The story was filled with action that was believable but it was worth to watch once.",

There are more than enough over-the-top action scenes and strange moments for football fans (Tony Cottee from Sky Sports showing up, for instance) to make this one enjoyable. Sometimes there is nothing wrong with the totally brainless. Pierce Brosnan's insanely phoned-in performance as a Russian on the run is hilarious in and of itself. Overall, I would recommend it.",

    "text": "Bautista is quickly becoming one of my favorite action movie stars. Much like Stallone's films, his movies are fast paced and keep you on the edge of your seat. This story is so quick, you blink and you'll miss an important component of the plot. Absolutely loved it. And the guy that worked at the soccer/football game almost stole the show. He was hilarious and quirky and had so many epic one-liners. This is a must see, and in fact, it's a movie I will definitely watch more than once. If you like action-packed thrills with some humor perfectly thrown in, you'll like Final Score. You will not be bored for a second.",
