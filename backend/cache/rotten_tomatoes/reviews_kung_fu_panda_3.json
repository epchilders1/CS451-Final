    "text": "My first question is: Why does this movie gets so much negative in certain things? Let me correct that for you all. The positives: First of all this movie was an amazing conclusion to the franchise until the 4th one. The animation and visuals are even better than the previous 2. The opening scene where Oogway fights Kai the main villain is so badass and amazing. I really liked the return of Oogway in a meaningful way. Also Kai is still a great villain, his design is so cool and badass. The soundtrack and Kai's main theme song is perfect. Po's actual dad is a great new character with a great voice acting. I also enjoyed how Mr.ping became a way more important character in this movie than the previous 2.  The humour was still great and the montages of the training of the pandas is so well done. Amazing animation and visuals during the main battles of this movie. I also enjoyed the quotes of master Shifu. The negatives: Despite this movie was a great conclusion to the franchise until the 4th one theres still some flaws but that didn't annoy me much. Kai's backstory and motivations for being evil was kind of weak and not reaching the levels of the previous 2 villains he feels like a rage monster more. The pacing of the movie is a bit weird but not too bad. They abused a bit the humour stuff but still enjoyable. Finally, this was a great conclusion of the franchise before the 4th one. I would really recommend it to watch it and it's quite entertaining and fun.",

Visually stunning for certain.  It's fun and light as we'd expect.  And we have Simmons impressively chewing the virtual scenery.",
