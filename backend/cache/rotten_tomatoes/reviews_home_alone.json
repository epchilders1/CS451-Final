    "text": "This movie is LITERALLY THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE OF ALL TIME! You have to watch it if you haven\u2019t seen it. It has a great story, amazing actors and characters, and really funny parts at times. The traps are well thought up and clever, as well as funny and diverse. Even if you think this movie is for kids, just try it. It is literally my favorite movie of all time. The score on rotten tomatoes is for some reason kind of mid. This movie deserves a 100% all the way. You can\u2019t  go wrong with this movie! Merry Christmas!",
