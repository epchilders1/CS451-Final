The movie just falls flat on its premise though, I feel like Garfield is portrayed out of character, they try to make you sympathize with Garfield's dad but it just falls flat, though I honestly don't think Garfield really can work as a movie, cause Garfield's whole character is that he's lazy, but for a movie you have to actually make him do something. You know it's bad when jon is the most enjoyable character in this movie, give us the Jon Arbuckle movie please, though honestly I didn't really mind Chris pratt's performance, I thought he did decent with what he was given",

Just like his performance in the Super Mario Bros movie, it's the worst thing about the movie. The other aspects are also very mediocre. The jokes are rarely funny and the other characters seem very flat and boring. A waste of film and time",

The only big difference I noticed from the original comics is that Odie is now insanely talented, but honestly I think that works better than him just being a mindless tool for Garfield to push around. I stayed away from this movie because of the critics, but I regret that decision. Watch this movie!",

Y\u2019all are some real sad miserable human beings you probably ate up all those Disney remakes even the train wreck that was Snow White! I came on here just to see because I knew it would be bad , literally nothing lives up to yalls standards\n, you\u2019re douchey pretentious snobs , this movie rocked and my toddler loved it , just because it\u2019s a remake god forbid it be recognized as good, yall do realize that the Garfield yall grew up on was a remake , the first Garfield\u2019s adaptation came out in 1976 in a comic and the first cartoon in 88.. The one we grew up on wasn\u2019t even the original , it\u2019s been remade so many times!! Also here\u2019s something that\u2019s really gonna have yall shat your pants , just because it came first doesn\u2019t mean it was the best version..\ud83d\ude01 Yall are no better than the paparazzi, rockstars that do insurance commercials,  or that person that works at a call center hammering you with calls to use their gutter services , you sold out for your dishonest fabricated review.
