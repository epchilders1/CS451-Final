    "text": "The movie is a light and entertaining comedy drama. Cinematographically and acting-wise it is very well done. This is surprising given the great number of pro-basketball players (i.e. part-time actors). This is also where the movie shines most. It is full of real-life basketball stars that blend in seamlessly into this movie. \n\nWhat I find most interesting in this movie is the following: money. Surprised? After all, this is a basketball movie. However, the movie is not about the game! It is not about rules, not about playstyles, not about technique, not about physique, not about team chemistry. It is about \"culture\", and a poor boy that gets the chance to get rich and prestigious (the American Dream). \n\nI find this a bit upsetting because I love basketball for what it means to me: A fun leisurely activity full of complex dynamics. Why couldn't the movie have been about this? It is not (for almost anyone) a serious professional endeavour, nor should it have to be one. I also find that this is the point where the movie stretches reality a little too much: A street ball player going to the NBA? Although not impossible per se, streetball and NBA are quite different and the chances of streetball players succeeding suddenly in pro basketball settings seems close to 0.",

    "text": "I never thought I'd care about a basketball movie, but this was more than that. I fully bought in on Adam Sandler's character and his relationship with Queen Latifah. Yes, it has a (nearly) predictable conclusion, but the journey was worth it. I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting ability of the NBA stars who played into the plot, especially Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez. And the casting of Ben Foster as the extremely punchable-faced co-owner of the 76ers was on point.",

The film lands emotional moments with sincerity, while its comedic beats never slip into the ridiculous. It\u2019s compelling, uplifting, and surprisingly grounded. Highly recommend it",

    "text": "Serious Sandler remains an underrated great. A relevant basketball film about the current worldwide growth of the sport and the NBA\u2019s increased interest in players across the globe for the next foreign-born phenomenon. It\u2019s influenced by the fellow Philadelphia sports story, \u201cRocky\u201d, and nails the necessary points that make a great sports film with enough deviations to make it unique. Adam Sandler is great at delivering in the drama-leaning scenes, but still has enough lines that let his humor shine through. All the NBA players who act in this film deliver serviceable performances, Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez rises to the challenge of playing a prominent character and Anthony Edwards steels every scene he is in. It\u2019s a great pure sports film and a must-watch for NBA fans.",
