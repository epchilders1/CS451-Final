I understand the struggle to be shown but shes too fierce to not have a little of her flare. Overall, alot going on in film and not all connections were given throughout film.",

    "text": "Filme: \tFERIDA\t\t\tAssistido: 13/6/25\nElenco: @halleberry @sheilaatim @adancanto @shamieranderson @a.lenoxzach \nModelo: #esporte #drama\nDura\u00e7\u00e3o: 2h 18m\tAno: 2020\nMinha opini\u00e3o: Berry com 58 anos, esta mandando muito bem. Um filme que retrata o drama daqueles que vem do sub\u00farbio, de fam\u00edlias desestruturadas, que tem relacionamentos doentios e tem filhos neste mesmo universo, e que o trauma vai passado de gera\u00e7\u00e3o para gera\u00e7\u00e3o. Seja nos relacionamentos, v\u00edcios, traumas e conflitos de relacionamento. Este \u00e9 o filme que mostra a vida da lutadora de MMA Jackie (BErry) vive. E com seu parceiro Desi (canto) e tudo muda quando aparece um filho de Jackie que vivia com o pai. Depois de assassinado vem morar com ela. Porem com o conv\u00edvio j\u00e1 era dif\u00edcil com Desi, depois da vida da crian\u00e7a, tudo piorou. E antes que ele maltratasse a crian\u00e7a ela sai, vai morar com m\u00e3e, que n\u00e3o dura muitos dias e muda novamente para o apartamento da treinadora budda (Atim), com quem acaba tendo um relacionamento. At\u00e9 quando chega o dia da luta pelo cintur\u00e3o. Cenas muito bem constru\u00eddas que pareceu real. Isto mostra quanto Berry treinou muito. Cenas bem filmadas, e sem preten\u00e7\u00e3o, ela perde mas com a decis\u00e3o dividia. O filme termina com ela reiniciando sua vida com seu filho. Com boa atua\u00e7\u00e3o dos atores e m\u00e9ritos de Berry. Um filme revelando o drama de v\u00e1rias fam\u00edlias.\nVale apena assistir? Sim. Boa atua\u00e7\u00e3o de Berry e como esta bem de forma, poderiam fazer um filme como Bailariana no universo John Wick para ela, contando sua est\u00f3ria.\nNota: 8",

Bruised as a drama sport film is probably more drama than sport however as a drama film, it also delivers I was expecting more action with fight scenes, but the whole movie was a buildup to the one scene at the end, which delivered in my opinion, Halle Berry does deliver well in that motherhood type role I think the movie would\u2019ve benefitted from more fight scenes and more action in the octagon but I could see movie lovers liking this film. MMA fans may not like it as much as they might be expecting more action with the film delivers.",

I couldn't suspend my disbelief for long enough to believe that someone Halle's age was playing that part. Sheila Atim did well and so did Danny Boyd Jr. as her son.",

This one is also a bit on lengthy side for those that can't handle a bit of slow pacing or are on the verge of falling asleep",

    "text": "As a big UFC fan, I am perhaps more critical of the training and fight sequences than the average movie-goer, but I didn't find the action very realistic. I realize you can't teach Halle Berry how to fight in a few short months of movie-making, but even making allowances for that, it was hard to watch sloppy technique. \n\nThe story itself was fine and the performances all around were good; they just weren't as good as I would have liked. Pretty good outing for Berry in her directorial debut.\n\nIf you're a fight fan, this might be worth a look for you. There are several appearances by people you'll recognize from the fight game.",

Arguably a top 5 performance in 2021, although that category has a LOT of competition (Chastain, Gaga, Stewart, Coleman, Hudson, Jones, Haim, Zegler, Bullock...)\n\nOtherwise, boring and, uh... been done?  Who's with me here -- when she lost the decision, did you expert her to start yelling, \"Adrienne...?\"",

Ya see....... in life.... we go through tons of rough times when we continue to fall and have to continue getting back up. No highs or lows, just a constant never ending gritty road. This was one of the most uncut films I've seen in some time, lead by one of the most phenomenal female actresses of the 2nd/3rd millennium.

Awful, I wish Netflix could give me back the time I wasted watching this. It actually took me 4 separate sitting to stomach the writing and acting. Would rather stand inline at the DMV then watch this movie",
