Although there were slight modifications to the story, it was still an awesome movie, and I had so much fun watching it. The animation was beautiful, the story was compelling, and the characters were so fun and vibrant in their own unique ways. I definitely recommend it for animation and fantasy fans!",

The characters, the story, the animation; everything spot on. The film that is a fun right from the word go till the end. Top of the shelf Netflix animated films. It rests with Netflix another animated hit 'Klaus'. I recommend to watch it with your kids, friends, spouses. A must watch for people of all ages. Going to watch it again and again and again. Lastly, it is the first time I am watching animated film with the voice of \"Riz Ahmed\" and boy, I am not disappointed.",

Plot wasn't terrible, characters were okay, if you want a movie for your kids to watch for a bit I'm sure it's great but if you're watching as an adult there a better animated movies out there, this movie failed to hold my attention.",

The dark moments work their way naturally into an otherwise lighthearted action comedy.",

    "text": "This was very good but but honestly could have been better. A lot of the plot points were good but underdevelloped. For exemple, the flashback for Nimona's backstory was fast and cut short i feel like. I would have liked more time with these characters, because at the climax of the movie when Nimona dies i didnt reallly feel any emotion, because of the lack of time with these people. The animation was good but not on the level of others like Spider verse and PB2. On the representation, i dont really have an opinion. Like its good that theres rep I guess but Ballister and Ambrosius are not giving there time together that much. I like the nacho seen tho. Should see the movie if you like things in the same vein.",
