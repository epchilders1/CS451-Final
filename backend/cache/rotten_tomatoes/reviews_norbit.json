Reading the critics' reviews it just makes me wonder, \"What were they thinking?\" I mean,  did you really go to an EDDIE MURPHY movie expecting a sophisticated and grounded story? Please grow up and learn to have fun. Movies are about entertaining the masses; if it isn't for you, then go watch something that is. Don't bully those who genuinely enjoy it. 3.5/5 stars.",

Packed with comedy and drama only Eddie can bring to life, this movie was hilariously funny. Each character played their part well and never gets old. Im sure we can relate we all know someone or a family member going through something similar. I\u2019d recommend watching!",
