    "text": "It's like a cross between a cheap romantic comedy and a spanish telenovella. There are a few decent laughs along the way, but it is ultimately not a memorable film outside of the general showcasing of Croatia and how undoubtedly everyone watching this film is thinking about how nice it would be to escape everything and go to a place where you can sit and stare at the sea from your fancy, simple cliff barn/house thing and forget the awfulness of the world around you. It's pretty predictable. But charming none the less. I'd say put it on if you are ready to read and don't mind some simple escapism.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Um filme que te leva para a Gr\u00e9cia, lembrando o filme \"Mama Mia\" com Meryl Streep, mas apenas lembra, pois este filme n\u00e3o \u00e9 um musical. Conta  estoria de Zeynap que \u00e9 casada, tem 1 filha adolecente Fia, esposo e o pai que moram todos juntos. O marido tem um restaurante e bem no dia do enterro da m\u00e3e de Zeynap ele n\u00e3o aparece pois esta dando aten\u00e7\u00e3o a sua nova empregada. A filha toda rebelde com m\u00e3e, sem a respeita la. E seu pai todo ranzinza que n\u00e3o ouve oque a filha fala ou faz. No testamento sua m\u00e3e deixou uma casa na Gr\u00e9cia e como ela tava de saco cheio ela deixa tudo e vai. Chegando la percebe que tem algu\u00e9m que mora l\u00e1 Josip. E ele havia vendido a casa para a m\u00e3e dela. Ent\u00e3o com a chegada dela, ele arma uma barraca do lado da casa, onde diz que ali \u00e9 seu terreno. E assim come\u00e7a um relacionamento todo atrapalhado onde Josip \u00e9 o faz tudo no vilarejo. E com um inicio conturbado acabam fazendo \"aquilo\" e quem pega ela na cama? Sua filha rebelde e ent\u00e3o vem o pai dela com o sogro tamb\u00e9m para casa e vem o irm\u00e3o de Josip al\u00e9m de galanteador Conrad al\u00e9m de outros vizinhos. O barraco esta armado.\nRoteiro e enredo j\u00e1 conhecido e estamos cansados de ver. A diferen\u00e7a aqui s\u00e3o os atores que s\u00e3o bem cativantes e que prende a aten\u00e7\u00e3o do expectador. Parab\u00e9ns por fazer do sempre, bem feito.\nVale apena assistir? Sim para dar aquela risada leve.\nNota: 7",

    "text": "It's definitely a movie you've seen before but the storyline is executed so well that it feels familiar and comforting, rather than redundant and derivative. Similarly, the male lead is a character archetype reminiscent of the male lead in Bridesmaids but when it's performed so brilliantly do you really care? This is just pure fun and escapist fare that isn't trying to be anything more than that \u2014which is a gift in itself. Download it for your next plane ride and relax.",
