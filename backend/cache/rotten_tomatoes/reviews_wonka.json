Only issue is it may be too light hearted compared to the source material, but again, this is a reimagining of a classic story. Overall its fun for the whole family!",

Extravagant, funny, witty, very cleverly written (or re-written?), amazingly adapted and very well executed. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet shines in character and rest of cast also does not disappoint. Lovely adaptation and perhaps the most definitive iteration so far of this mesmerizing and intriguing tale. Brilliant cinematography and visually stunning. Great new songs as well. Absolute joy to watch",

    "text": "When this movie came out I thought that it's gonna have the same concept and story as in the previous 2 movies, just another remake with some modern twist to it. And I immediately got very skeptical because we don't need the same thing, we need a new story. It turned out to be pretty good and it's actually a prequel to the previous movies. Throughout the movie we can see what happened with Wonka before he opened his chocolate factory and became so famous. Another thing I didn't knew that it's a musical. The movie is cute, Timothee did his thang. Was it one of the best musicals I ever saw? No, it was very decent.",
