    "text": "\u201cHit Man\u201d is a sharp, stylish, and surprisingly funny ride. The movie blends action, comedy, and a bit of romance in a way that actually works, and Glen Powell carries the whole thing with a ton of charisma. The plot is clever without trying too hard, and the pacing keeps things moving without dragging. It\u2019s not a perfect film\u2014some moments feel a little over-the-top\u2014but overall it\u2019s entertaining, smart, and way more fun than I expected. Definitely worth watching.",

Incase that's too much for the viewer to take in all at once, the same thing happens over and over again relentlessly until about 40 mins left which was also the time I gave up and left!! the tv to switch itself off with the motion sensor!!! Lots of questions get asked, lots of creepy smiles and a man gets angry in the street. Half star is incase the ends good but I doubt it. 1 star for just a random 10 minute segment of the film",
