    "text": "Although we don't learn anything new about these alien creatures from this prequel, it is worth the watch.\n\nLupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn give heart felt performances. Joseph Quinn is quickly becoming one of my favorite male actors and Lupita Nyong'o is just such a gem. She's a pleasure to watch. \n\nThe story is one of humanity. Two people, though reluctantly at first on Miss Nyong'o character's part, strengthening each other at their weakest moments. It is a story of loss, yet filled with hope, given through the strength of these two main characters and a very loyal cat.",

    "text": "Rating: 7.6/10\n\nA poignant, tense prequel succeeding due to Lupita Nyong'o's performance and unique emotional angle.\n\nHighlights\n- Emotional Story: Focuses on terminally ill Sam's quest for agency in her final moments.\n- Strong Performance: Lupita Nyong'o delivers a masterclass in acting without dialogue.\n- Intimate Direction: Michael Sarnoski brings a character-driven approach, emphasizing human connection.\n\nCriticisms\n- Predictable Plot: Familiar \"hide-and-seek\" formula and known invasion outcome lower stakes.\n- Underutilized Characters: Djimon Hounsou's character feels like a bridge to the next film.\n- Limited Scope: May disappoint viewers expecting a military-heavy war movie.\n\nVerdict\nA worthy addition to the franchise, trading action for a somber meditation on mortality and human connection. Recommended for fans of horror with emotional depth.",

It's well acted and directed but it lacks real tension and the fact that we see the creatures from the first moments of the movie doesn't help to build up suspense that's instead much needed.",

Also I was expecting more visual effects since they decided to bring \"Quiet Place\" to NY... They could've done a much better job at showing more of the city & just in general it felt like they were hiding from those monsters on the same street the entire movie. But overallit was okay. It got emotional at the end, which was a highlight.",

And while that is usually not my favorite, I must join those who have praises for this particular entry to the field.  Lupita Nyong'o and several other actors were excellent in conveying fear as well as the determination to survive. I wish we had seen more of Djimon Honsou - we always enjoy his work. But the star of the movie has to be Schnitzel the cat, playing the part of Frodo, the most amazing comfort/service animal ever portrayed in a movie!",
