    "text": "The main problem with Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody is that it\u2019s too long. This is partly due to all the full-length musical numbers. Yes, Houston was a great singer, but we don\u2019t need to see each song in its entirety. And I would praise Naomi Ackie for her vocals, but she was just lip-syncing most of the time. Also, this biopic made me like Houston a little less, and everyone around her is a stock character with no real progression. If you were alive when these events were occurring then you already know what happened, so you could skip Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody.",

I'm glad I got to learn more about Whitney Houston's music career, but I was kinda shocked they did not seem to emphasize her personal life more. Like they gave us plenty, but I did not see the commitment in that side of her life compared to her music career. Overall, still well done.",

A bit too much is made of the performances - as we\u2019re not actually watching Whitney herself and it\u2019s definitely a celebration rather than an expos\u00e9 but I\u2019m good with that. A brilliant performance by Naomi Acke.",

    "text": "The songs and music is he reason why I gave it 2.5 stars (I got goose bumps and tears every time I heard a song) but the movie lacks substance and misses many of her life's special moments, like the huge hit of her mivie and her special performance for Michael Jackson. It also didn't have the right timeline.  I Have Nothing was made for the movie The Bodyguard, not after! The ending was abrupt  short and a bit confusing, for me. \nIf you love Whitney H, you'll love this movie for the fact that they play a lot of her hits.",

    "text": "I Wanna Dance With Somebody is a biopic that simplifies the hard live of Whitney Houston, while they delete any content  that a 9 year old couldnt watch. Yes, they mention she had an addiction to drugs, or an abusive husband, but you will never see nothing but the top of the iceberg. If you want to know the most important moments of her live, you will see them, but with anything remarkable rather than Stanley Tucci and the songs, and you will do this for 2 hours and a half.",

    "text": "Why does this site keep taking down my review? \nIs honesty such a touchy subject for people?\n\nIf I could give this movie less than half-a-star, I would.  \n\nI love biopics and there have been so many incredible ones.  So, for someone as renowned and great as Whitney Houston, this film quite frankly was not an accurate reflection of what she achieved and the legacy she has left behind or even who she was as a person.  \n\nNaomi Ackie as Whitney was miscast, as she looks absolutely NOTHING like her.  I think it was important to get the casting right as Whitney was renowned for her beauty (as she was a model first and foremost) before she signed with Arista.  Let's be real, do you think Titanic would have done so well at the box office if they didn't cast a very young and gorgeous Leonardo Dicaprio to look at for the next three hours?\n\nThe story for IWDWS was bad and just jumped from place to place with inaccuracies all over the story.  If you want a better and more truthful look at Whitney, read her friend Robyn Crawford's book or watch the Whitney documentary by Kevin MacDonald.  Both did far more to uphold Whitney's legacy.",

It won't give you nightmares, it won't make you swoon, but it will give you an appreciation for the beautiful, flawed, human being behind the pop star who was devoured by the media and her own family. This film inspires a new generation of strong and powerful women.",

The film leaves viewers feeling tantalizingly close to the energy and spirit of Houston's performances but ultimately yearning for a deeper connection and understanding of her personal journey. Despite its shortcomings, the film offers a relatively decent watch, particularly for fans eager to relive Houston's iconic moments on stage and explore the complexities of her life and career.",
