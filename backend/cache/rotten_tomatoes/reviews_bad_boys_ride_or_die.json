    "text": "The first couple of Bad Boy movies were fun and not quite so ridiculous.  But looking at the audience rating for this film, you can see why Hollywood has shifted even more towards childish fantasy, glorified mass killing, unstoppable super-heroes, dumbed-down, predictable, moronic movies. And no wonder that there is such a massive migration to TV shows where it\u2019s still possible to find something a little more satisfying. Most movies are simply not worth watching (unless you\u2019re your stoned or drunk).  This being one of them.",

Will, as always, takes center stage, but the others don't compromise as much.\nI recommend it when you're not in the mood for reasoning.",

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence still crack me up\u2014their chemistry is evergreen\u2014but man, this one lands squarely in the \u201cmid\u201d category. The plot? Predictable. The jokes? A little too thin. It keeps trying to inject weight and drama, but you never really *feel* it, and in the process it kinda loses that chaotic Bad Boys energy. Seeing Ioan Gruffudd pop up is always a treat, but even that can\u2019t mask the mediocrity of the dialogue. It\u2019s not boring\u2014just never special. If you\u2019re a diehard like me, you\u2019ll squeeze a bit more fun out of it, but honestly, they should\u2019ve stopped after the trilogy.\n\n---\n\nWant me to punch it up with a snappier \u201cclosing line\u201d for extra bite?",
