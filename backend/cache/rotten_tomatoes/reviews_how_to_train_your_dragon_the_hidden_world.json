The story was very good, but the bond between Hiccup and Toothless should definitely be more prominent than the bond between Toothless and Light Fury. Anyway, it is a very good animated film and I think it deserves the Oscar more than Toy Story 4.",

I was a little weirded out that people thought Toothless should stay with Hiccup, but the whole franchise was about change. Hiccup relied on Toothless a lot, and Toothless relied on him, and them separating shows maturity and independence. I\u2019m glad they moved on. Hiccup showed his great potential!",

The bond between Hiccup and Toothless is stronger than ever, and seeing them grow and make tough decisions was truly inspiring.

    "text": "this was just a merch machine. it's okay, but a lot of the action and some basic character movements seem to be half finished. we get a lot of cuts which skip the hard parts and just sort of show people magically getting away from an explosion or whatever. toothless and his gf's whole sequence felt poorly done as well, with none of the impeccable body language and choreography that went into making toothless so appealing in the first movie. they are out of ideas by the time this trilogy comes around, and it shows. we get another villain of the week, he's much less interesting than the one from the sequel. for a movie that came out around 10 years later, its weird that a lot of the animation looks worse than before. the overall quality of objects is better, there's more detail, but the natural movement is almost entirely gone. they seem to rely on a lot of physically impossible things happening off screen so that there are no real consequences to falling or getting hit, and thats fine when the movie is being cartoony, but it's not really acceptable for the serious segments.",
