Having watched all the Rambo\u2019s each movie tells a story with the mix of action and violence.\n\nIn the latest Rambo after watching it again for the second time in full, I admire the real graphic violent which Sly brings to elite. It\u2019s grittier, emotional and aftermath. No other true Hollywood legend does it better without the use of flake CGI or Green Screen effects.\n\nRambo should be around today to fight and clear our today\u2019s global mess.",

    "text": "Last Blood is a great ending to an absolutely fantastic franchise (we can ignore Rambo 3). While not Quite having Stallone's directoral spark it's honestly still a good film with some absolutely hardcore and even hard to watch brutal scenes. It's definitely the most violent Rambo installment and has some really great special effects. I think Stallone's Rambo franchise slightly beats The Terminator Franchise because the last two films (from The Terminator Franchise) are absolutely terrible, Rambo films are going to be amazing for a midweek film slump where I need a short action film. In a way it almost feels like a Western but honestly for what it is it's very good as it's own thing (hard to explain).",

    "text": "Rambo (2008) - A Forgettable, Bloody Skirmish*\n\nSylvester Stallone reprises his iconic role as John Rambo in this lackluster installment. The film's setting shifts to the Thai-Burma border, where Rambo (Stallone) gets entangled in a mission to rescue a group of Christian aid workers from the brutal Burmese army.\n\nThe plot is predictable and formulaic, with Rambo single-handedly taking down hordes of enemies in a series of grueling battles. While Stallone still brings some charisma to the role, his character's development is stagnant, and his motivations feel contrived.\n\nThe film's pacing is uneven, veering wildly between moments of intense action and awkward dialogue. The supporting cast, including Ken Choi and Reed Diamond, is underutilized and forgettable.\n\nThe film's themes of violence, redemption, and the cyclical nature of conflict are timely, but they're handled heavy-handedly. The cinematography is competent, but it lacks the flair and style that would elevate the film beyond its mediocrity.\n\nOverall, *Rambo (2008)* feels like a rehashing of familiar tropes without adding anything new or compelling to the franchise. It's a bloody, forgettable skirmish that fails to leave a lasting impact.\n\nIf you're a die-hard Rambo fan, you might find some enjoyment in this film. Otherwise, it's skippable.",
