    "text": "Casper is a complicating movie, i mean it can have it's heartwarming moments with the father-daughter relationship with Dr. James Harvey and his daughter Kathleen (or Kat for short) with the latter having a good relationship with the main character and decent gags, unfortunately at the same time there are a couple of things that drag this movie down like the jokes, the cliqued antagonist and the unnecessary pop-culture references. Outside of Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman it also has cast like Eric Idle, Brad Garrett, Joe Alaskey (may he rest in peace) and Ben Stein along with some surprising cameos like Dan Aykroyd, Fred Rogers, Clint Eastwood, Jess Harnell and unfortunately Mel Gibson, anyways my personal recommendation is that if want to watch something spooky & fun then maybe check it out if not your'e probably better of watching \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" sure Casper not the best film that came of 1995 but it's certainly not that terrible either.",

But compared to today\u2019s unimaginative and repetitive movies, it\u2019s now a charming, wholesome, state-of-the-art  (even to today\u2019s standards) piece of entertainment with impressive special effects. Bill Pullman feels underused in the film, but Christina Ricci and Casper make a great duo. A great family movie.",

This shows what a good family film can be when theres jokes for everyone: times when the adults laughed with jokes that went over the kids heads and times when they laughed.  Film holds up well",
