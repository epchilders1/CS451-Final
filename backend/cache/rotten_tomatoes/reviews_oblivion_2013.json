    "text": "\u201cOblivion\u201d es una pel\u00edcula tan extra\u00f1a que a\u00fan no s\u00e9 si me encant\u00f3 o no, y con ello no quiero decir que no me haya gustado. El Plot Twist me fascin\u00f3, al igual que la lenta resoluci\u00f3n del conflicto. Como ya es t\u00edpico en el cine de Joseph Kosinski, una imagen dice m\u00e1s que mil palabras, y esta pel\u00edcula tiene unos visuales hermosos, adem\u00e1s de un dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n impecable. En cuestiones t\u00e9cnicas es sobresaliente. Y narrativamente, aunque me parece s\u00f3lida, s\u00ed me parece que alarga demasiado el misterio para mantener intrigado al espectador, y aunque lo logra, hay momentos que se sienten como Deux Ex Machina con justificaciones confusas para darle resoluci\u00f3n al conflicto.\n\nAlgo que amo del cine de Joseph Kosinski es su ritmo. En ning\u00fan momento sus pel\u00edculas aburren y, aunque el planteamiento del conflicto es muy simple, le agrega capas de profundidad que hacen que te termine genuinamente interesando la historia y los personajes. Aunque Jack est\u00e1 lejos de ser uno de los personajes m\u00e1s ic\u00f3nicos de Tom Cruise, a medida que comprendemos al personaje y su corrupci\u00f3n tanto personal como externa, termina por convertirse en un protagonista que disfrutamos ver en cada escena.\n\nUna de las cosas que no me gustaron de esta pel\u00edcula fue su desarrollo. Por momentos (sobre todo en el primer acto) es muy lento, lo cual no me parece negativo, pero para el segundo y tercer acto la trama se agiliza demasiado, y hace que el Incidente Incitador no se sienta tan org\u00e1nico. Lo mismo sucede con el tratamiento de la fuerza antag\u00f3nica, que no termina por tener una motivaci\u00f3n totalmente clara y raya en lo superficial.\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos generales, esta es una gran pel\u00edcula Sci-Fi. Una historia de alto presupuesto, nueva, que no pertenece a ning\u00fan universo, con unos visuales y dise\u00f1os de producci\u00f3n atractivos, un giro de tuerca que vuelve a este mundo a\u00fan m\u00e1s interesante y con un protagonista entra\u00f1able. Aunque tal vez no tenga una historia tan s\u00f3lida, s\u00ed me parece lo suficientemente entretenida para pasar un buen rato y ver con buenos ojos una posible secuela. Este es el tipo de cine que, aunque no es perfecto, vale la pena apoyar, porque a diferencia de los cientos y cientos de universos que vemos cada a\u00f1o, este busca ser propositivo, y eso siempre se agradece.",

    "text": "Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Oblivion is an underrated film that offers a unique blend of action, suspense, and drama. With its breathtaking visuals and a captivating narrative, this movie is sure to appeal to fans of science fiction. The soundtrack, composed by M83, is equally impressive and adds depth to the overall experience.\n\nGrading: B-",

    "text": "Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of the rearguard of a humanity that has left earth for Titan, Saturn's largest moon. After a catastrophic war with extraterrestrials, they have to maintain the drones that protect huge water-collecting rigs from scavenging aliens that have survived the war. When an orbiting spacecraft plunges to earth, a story of deception, romance and heroism unfurls. This is one of my favorite feel-good films. 5 stars!\nPS. Critics who call it 'thinly scripted' might have to watch it again and more attentively at that.",

    "text": "think it\u2019s a film that has aged well, with outstanding cinematography, editing, and production design. The story is solid and it features strong performances from Andrea Riseborough and Morgan Freeman, but aside from Tom Cruise, the cast doesn\u2019t quite come together, especially Olga Kurylenko, whose role feels somewhat out of place in the film. Another drawback is the plot holes, such as the little girl who appears at the end, which was not well developed. On the other hand, M83\u2019s score is spectacular, though at times it tends to overshadow the narrative.",

    "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Oblivion\" (2013) is a very good science fiction story. On its core this is an action and adventure movie. I highly enjoyed it way back in 2013, and now revisiting it 2025 on 4K UHD disk - which looks and sounds amazing - i did as well. Tom Cruse was solid in this film as he always is. But its the story is what keeps this movie going, and it's a very good one - for a real science fiction film fans. Although it borrows from many others movies like \"Matrix\", \"WALL-E\" and so on, but hey, when its done this well - who cares. Story kept me engaged till the very end, and all twists and plot turns were good and involving. It is not the most original one, but a really good one. Special effects were very good, but they are not the essential thing in this film - the story is. Cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful - \"Oblivion\" is a gorgeous looking movie. Music was good. \n\nOverall, if you like science fiction, action adventure stories, which contains good special effects and a good story even if not the most original one - \"Oblivion\" is not to be missed for sure. At running time 2 hours i never drag and is a superb watch.",
