    "text": "Its so horrible I had to do a little research and it sounds like it was made when Bruce Willis was already having major issues from dementia. Many of the crew on this film and others made by the same production company (and featured Willis) have said that Bruce seemed confused as to why he was there and had to have an earpiece so they could feed him his lines. Once you learn that, its understandable why there is always a slight delay in his responses when speaking to the other characters and his reaction are a little \"off\". Like most of the other movies from 2021-2023, they were done by the same production company and Bruce was paid $2 million for 2 days worth of filming which equates to about 15-30 minutes of screen time. Then they use his image to promote the film. Kinda sad when you realize that he was genuinely confused throughout the majority of the process - regardless of how much he made. This movie is even more difficult to watch when you realize all of that.",

It was clear this was the first movie for the rest of the actors (except Ashley) as the acting was subpar, and that\u2019s being generous.",

    "text": "The reviews are infinitely better than the movie. As someone else said, this \u201cmovie\u201d is so awful that I signed up to Rotten Tomatoes to try to save people from watching this. It\u2019s bad. Really, really bad. I\u2019ve seen bad movies that were TRYING to be bad, look like Gone with the Wind after this mess. Did the director lose a bet or something?? If I gave my dog a camera, he\u2019d do a better job, and he ain\u2019t that smart a dog. I envy those reviewers that worked out how to give 0.5 stars. I wish they allowed zero stars. Does Bruce Willis owe him money? How did this car crash happen? I\u2019d strongly advise the actors not to acknowledge their roles in this, unless they were silently protesting and actually wanting to give up acting. The 5 year old who wrote the script should be sent back to kindergarten. Unacceptable from him! That\u2019s it from me. I can\u2019t think of anything worse to say and I\u2019m falling asleep. Imagine staying awake for this pile of poop and THEN knocking out. Gonna recommend it to my ex-wife. At least then it\u2019ll give me a wee bit of joy.",

This movie had some of the worst acting, editing, graphics, and story lines I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s worse than a B movie which is surprising because Bruce Willis was in it so we thought it would be worth a watch\u2026but the \u201csouthern accents\u201d and honestly complete movie was unrealistic. It was so hard to watch that we have seen some pretty B and D class movies, but this one here takes the cake\u2026..unless you want roll your eyes throughout the movie, I dont recommend it\u2026.",
