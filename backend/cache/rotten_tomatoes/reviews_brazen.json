It's very difficult to suspend disbelief as far as the massive conflict of interest for the lead detective goes, or the fact the chief seems to be more inclined to listen to a writer than her best detective. \nA hour and thirty-six minutes I'll never get back.",

The ending was a little desappointing, I hoped for more mystery...but, anyway, it is a really nice movie for what it is.",

A trama se passa, quando a irm\u00e3 Alyssa chama a irm\u00e3 para contar oque iria fazer com seu ex-marido. Mas no dia seguinte ela aparece morta. E o vizinho da irm\u00e3 \u00e9 um policial com que Alyssa come\u00e7a um relacionamento. E Alyssa come\u00e7a a investigar a morta da irm\u00e3, mas v\u00e3o aparecendo novas vitimas, at\u00e9 que Alyssa se faz passar no lugar da irm\u00e3 que fazia show er\u00f3ticos pela web. Para pegar o criminoso. At\u00e9 que pegam o criminoso e termina o filme. O filme todo \u00e9 superficial. Momentos que for\u00e7am o filme. \nRoteiro: o roteiro faz at\u00e9 sentido, porem a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e a atua\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o ajudam.\nVale apena assistir? N\u00e3o\nNota: 3",
