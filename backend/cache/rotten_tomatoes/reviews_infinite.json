Mark Wahlberg seems okay in frivolous B movies but as a one-dimensional actor it\u2019s a mystery why you\u2019d cast him in anything potentially serious or worthwhile.",

It was not cohesive, it did not tell a story, it was confusing. It only gets 3 stars from Mark Wahlberg or it would be a 2. A 2 is just above boredom and mildly entertaining.",

An interesting premise that could have been used and developed in many ways is wasted by not using it for anything at all, other than a wooden pretext for a lazy, dumb action movie.\n\nZero world building, horrible storytelling, horrible writing, horrible dialogue, horrible characters, mostly bad acting (prob not the actors\u2019 fault really, with this material\u2026). \nWhile the action scenes are decent, they are also pointless because no-one cares \u2014 everything else in this movie feels so amateurish you feel like watching a play written and acted by 12-year olds in a school theatre.\nThis movie fails at a lot of very standard stuff even B or C movies master with ease these days.\nSuch crap from Fuqua\u2026 inexplicable.",

    "text": "The concept at the heart of this film is undeniably intriguing, drawing you in with its promise of a fresh take on reincarnation. However, as the story unfolds, glaring inconsistencies pile up, making the plot predictable, tedious, and at times, downright incoherent. While the action sequences and visually striking cinematography attempt to salvage the experience, they can't fully mask the script's shortcomings. If you're a fan of reincarnation-themed content and don't mind overlooking flaws for the sake of the genre, this might still be worth a watch. I've seen it three times since its release, but by this latest viewing, the cracks in the narrative were too obvious to ignore\u2014almost as if the filmmakers leaned into them, hoping flashy visuals would distract us. Spoiler: they don't entirely succeed.",

Existe um grupo de Infinito que vive para melhorar a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o humana e a outra que quer exterminar a todos Infinitos. Nesta guerra temos Heinrich (O\u2019Brian) que escondeu o \u201cOvo\u201d artefato que pode eliminar a todos Infinito. Heinrich morre e com ele onde ele escondeu o Ovo. Ele reencarna como Eva (Wahlberg), porem ele sempre foi tratado como esquizofr\u00eanico e tomando medicamentos que n\u00e3o permitiram ele lembrar de quem era. Porem ele \u00e9 encontrado pela Nora (Cookson) que o salva de ser levado por Bathurst (Eijifor) o lider que quer o exterm\u00ednio dos Infinitos. O filme tem bons efeitos e vemos que teve um bom investimentos. Mas o roteiro peca com cenas for\u00e7adas  e incoerentes. A aceita\u00e7\u00e3o de Eva de toda a est\u00f3ria de forma tranquila. Se o filme tivesse um melhor roteiro, com certeza teria alcan\u00e7ado um sucesso maior. E neste filme temos Wahlberg novamente pulando de um avi\u00e3o como em Uncharted. E ao final todos s\u00e3o libertados, as almas que estavam aprisionadas. E os Infinitos continuam.\nVale apena assistir? sim, mas poderia ser bem melhor.\nNota: 7",
