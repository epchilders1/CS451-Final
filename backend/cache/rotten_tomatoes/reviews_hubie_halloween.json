    "text": "Hubie Halloween (2020) is a goofy, family-friendly Halloween comedy starring Adam Sandler as a well-meaning misfit trying to protect his town from spooky chaos. It\u2019s full of slapstick humor, silly characters, and cozy Halloween vibes. While the jokes can be hit-or-miss and the pacing uneven, the film\u2019s heart and colorful atmosphere make it a fun, harmless watch for casual viewers.\n\nCharming but uneven; more sweet than scary, and best enjoyed with low expectations and a bowl of candy.",

I don\u2019t really like how Adam Sandler acts in this one but his character is decent but I just hate that everyone is such an asshole to him for no reason. Is that funny? No it\u2019s really sad actually.",

    "text": "Adam Sandler, Kevin James AND Ben Stiller. Some of my most favorite actors ever all in one movie?!? \n\nIt\u2019s so funny to me that the main characters from grown ups tend to stay in movies together. I love it actually. \nI also love that he incorporates his daughters and wife and I\u2019ve never noticed how much he incorporates them. \n\nI also love at the very end he put a memories for Cameron Boyce \ud83e\udd79 \n\nThis movie was kinda cringe and definitely not one of Adam Sandler best but it was still good. \n\nThe amount of the most random actors I\u2019ve ever seen in movies is in this one. (Shaq O Neil, Peyton List, Maya Rudolph, Tim meadows, Kevin Quinn from girl meets world, Rob shneider, Good lunch Charlie character, Steve buscemi, Jude squipp, kid from stranger things, ravi from Jesse, girl from ant farm etc.) it\u2019s so weird seeing so many different people together.",
