    "text": "This sixth Scream movie was great. Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Courtney Cox, Hayden Panettiere, Mason Gooding, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Dermot Mulroney, Jack Champion, Liana Liberato, Josh Segarra, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot of the movie was intense, thrilling, and suspenseful. It's another insane killer movie with a twist you won't see coming. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",

    "text": "Worst movie in the series. Characters are flat and obnoxious. People survive things which clearly should have been fatal. It was a mockery of the original movie and made me wish that every character would just die already. The only saving grace in this shitshow of a movie was Danny, and he wasn\u2019t even close to being a main character. \nDon\u2019t waste your time. If you want to watch a slasher with the same kind of plot, just watch the original. That\u2019s where the plot is copy pasted from anyways.",

    "text": "9/10. 92/100. | SPOILERS!\nBehind the first one a tad bit bc I wanted Sam to be the killer. But also the killer(s) were a little underwhelming, but still surprising as hell.\nI love the character arcs of Sam and Tara, especially Sam. \nAnd I NEED one or both of them to be the killer in the next Scream. And the last Scream has to have one of the legacy characters as the killer, even one that was \u201ckilled\u201d off. Like Randy. His death was recorded, and could have been recorded just for the sole purpose to throw off Gale and Dewy at the time. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nBut solid movie, solid slasher & kills, and the characters and acting was all good to great. \n2nd best in the franchise!",

    "text": "In my opinion, it's the worst Scream film so far. It just had too many nonsensical moments and it's just getting too ridiculous for its own good. That being said, I've seen many worse installments in other franchises (especially in horror). It wasn't a pain to sit through and it had a few things I did like. I think the whole beginning sequence before the title was very interesting and well done. The cast of characters is fairly likeable for the most part. A lot of silly, dumb decisions were made by characters in a franchise that constantly points out tropes of other horror films. Some of the dialogue, especially towards the end, was cringe-worthy. It's a franchise that seems to be loosing steam very quickly, so I'm hoping that at the very least, the next one will turn out better than this one.",

    "text": "Scream 6 was a mixed bag overall for me, though it definitely had a lot of positives. Characters who felt underdeveloped in the previous film got more screen time and moments to shine here, and you really grow invested in the \u201ccore four.\u201d This is also by far the scariest and most gruesome Ghostface we\u2019ve seen yet\u2014the kills are bloodier and more brutal than ever. The New York City setting was a nice change of pace and felt refreshing, too.\nUnfortunately, several things held this one back for me. The killer reveal just didn\u2019t land\u2014their motive felt predictable and too similar to those in previous films. The reveal also came across as a bit of a cheap trick, especially with Quinn faking her death. Beyond that, the social commentary felt overly forced. That element has always been a hallmark of the Scream franchise, but here it comes off as shoehorned in.\nThere were also way too many fake-out deaths near the end, which I felt cheapened some genuinely emotional moments.\nOverall, Scream 6 is one of the weaker entries in the franchise, but I still enjoyed it and would recommend it to longtime fans.",

    "text": "With the Scream series of movies- this entry has a great plot and great story to go along with it. Some of the deaths are faked which leads to one heck of a twist near the end of the movie that is really gratifying. Also- kudos to the directors of this movie for writing in a reaction and response scene from Melissa Barrera's character from a rumor started about her being the killer in the last film- which was in actuality written in because fans unfairly judged her performance from the previous Scream film. This movie has a lot to offer and it pays off in a way that will keep fans gripped until the end. Also- my wife and I had the pleasure of meeting actor Roger L. Jackson at Nightmare Weekend in Cleveland, OH and he not only greeted us in his Ghost face voice, he also let us know about the Easter egg  with the person wearing the Mojo Jojo costume from The Powerpuff Girls on the set of the movie- which was a tribute to his voice over character from that series. \n4.5 out of 5 stars- I highly recommend seeing this movie.",
