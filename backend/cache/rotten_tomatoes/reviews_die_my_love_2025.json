    "text": "The main character is a young woman named Grace (Jennifer Lawrence). She\u2019s been psychologically traumatized since childhood, but now her mental state faces a new and severe trial when she and her boyfriend (Robert Pattinson) leave New York to live in a remote cabin, where she gives birth to a baby. Motherhood does not bring her happiness. Grace feels lonely, misunderstood, lost, sexually unfulfilled, lacking any sense of self beyond the role of \"mother and wife.\" She\u2019s like a wild animal taken out of its natural environment and locked in a cage \u2014 and now she\u2019s thrashing around that cage, losing her mind. As Lawrence herself says, her character is experiencing \"the death of her former life.\" Her partner does everything he can to help, but after each brief improvement, her fragile mental state plunges into a new downward spiral, more intense than the last.\nDirector Lynne Ramsay (We Need to Talk About Kevin) does not coddle the viewer \u2014 the uncomfortable scenes here and there are mercilessly long and physiologically detailed, and Grace\u2019s condition looks increasingly hopeless. That said, credit where it\u2019s due: the film is visually poetic, and the acting is astonishing. The stars of two 2000s teen franchises \u2014 Lawrence from The Hunger Games and Pattinson from Twilight \u2014 take on bold, unconventional roles that are not destined for box-office success. As Jennifer joked after the screening, \"All producers dream of making an adult-rated drama about a woman with postpartum depression. As soon as they heard about our project, they just started throwing money at us!\"\nLuckily, they had a producer who wasn\u2019t obsessed with profits. That producer was Martin Scorsese. He was the one who invited Jennifer to play the lead. And it worked out \u2014 it\u2019s not a film designed for a mass audience, but a very intriguing piece that invites fearless cinephiles to immerse themselves in the terrifying world of postpartum depression.",

    "text": "Die My Love promises much more than it can deliver. Lynne Ramsay creates an atmosphere of constant discomfort, where motherhood, isolation, and desire intersect in a suffocating way, but the narrative quickly loses itself in repetitive cycles, with no clear focus and no real progress.\n\nThe uneven editing and the fusion between hallucination and routine undermine the rhythm, although the 35mm photography and sound design create an impeccable atmosphere. In the end, it is Jennifer Lawrence who keeps the film alive, delivering a visceral performance that surpasses the material itself.\n\nDie My Love has power, but stumbles in its execution. The impact is there, it just doesn't come exactly from where the film imagines.",

I thought I'd give it a go. I knew within the first 10 minutes it wasn't going to go well. It's super disjointed and there's no real character development so you don't really resonate with anyone. She does some really weird cringe things and I just couldn't relate except for shooting the dog...before you come at me, watch the movie and you'll understand. We lasted an hour and decided to go watch paint dry, instead.",
