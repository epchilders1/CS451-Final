    "text": "This move was the definition of sorry excuse for a man meets woman who was recently rejected from her lifelong dream due to social standards surrounding aging. The entire movie has zero plot, let alone any subplot besides a failing bar/music hub?? Of course introducing a group of male strippers to a small town family owned business is the perfect solution to raise 30,000 dollars in a few weeks. Sub par writing mixed with sloppy direction led the actors into a frenzy of over enunciated facial expressions and random emotional outbursts that had zero correlation to the fragile \u201cstory\u201d. The female lead had no character development and gave up a life changing chance to pursue the career she loved with excellent opportunities included for some scrounged up self-pitying sour puss who, as they say, \u201cpractically grew up in a toolbox\u201d. The Merry Gentlemen displays egotistical behavior through a half human male character who falls in love with a woman who would rather spend her life with a bleach haired lumber jack than be dancing on Broadway. Watch this movie. It\u2019s funny!",

    "text": "Hallmark Mike. One of the mass-produced holiday films that Netflix churns out at this time of the year. With a majority of the budget spent on getting Chad Michael Murray to do his signature, thirst-trap squint, there was little left for a decent wig for Britt Robertson. The film\u2019s central, sexual appeal of having shirtless men dancing lacks any sensuality as most of the \u201cdancers\u201d appear to be still in the process of learning the provocative choreography. Everything about this movie is predictable and sauceless, but it has scenic festive scenes that add Christmas ambiance for viewers as they wrap presents or prepare Christmas dinner with this on in the background.",

He is a narcissistic gaslighter with no actual talent and not a single redeeming quality. And she just gave up her life because he got sad that she had a career she loved!

    "text": "\"The Merry Gentlemen\" (2024) is a feel-good Christmas movie that delivers exactly what you'd expect: festive cheer, a dash of romance, and a healthy dose of shirtless men dancing. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it's a perfectly enjoyable watch for those seeking lighthearted holiday entertainment.\n\nThe film follows Ashley, a Broadway dancer who returns home for Christmas after a career setback.  Determined to save her parents' struggling nightclub, she comes up with a rather unconventional plan: a male stripper show featuring local talent.\n\nThe premise is undeniably cheesy, but the film embraces its silliness with a wink and a smile. The dance sequences are surprisingly well-choreographed, offering a touch of \"Magic Mike\" magic to the holiday season.  The film's humor is lighthearted and occasionally even laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nThe romance between Ashley and Luke, the charming carpenter who joins the dance troupe, is predictable but sweet. The chemistry between the leads is decent, and their relationship adds a heartwarming element to the festive storyline.\n\nWhile the plot is predictable and the characters are somewhat one-dimensional, \"The Merry Gentlemen\" is a perfectly enjoyable holiday romp. It's a lighthearted and entertaining film that will leave you with a smile on your face and a touch of Christmas cheer.",

Watched this with my wife and we couldn\u2019t stop laughing at how bad it was. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s as if someone said let\u2019s make a 21 Jump Street, but christmas themed in a small town, with 10% of the budget and D grade actors. \n\nYou can safely skip this one in your christmas playlist, and wish I could purge it from my memory.",

    "text": "This film starts with a woman who seems to work for 6 weeks of the year as a dancer in a very lame Christmas review. She is fired because she has gotten too old. How could she afford to live on NYC performing as a chorus dancer in a Christmas show for a few weeks a year?\nThe premise is so stupid, woman looses her seasonal job  and moves back to her small mountain town and discovers her parents bar is going broke so she starts an all male review. This raises so many questions like, why not a mixed review if your intention is to make money? Why does this tiny town have so many men with 6 packs and so many women who come every night to watch?\nThe movie was vacuous, pretentious and self indulgent. There was no chemistry between the actors and I couldn\u2019t care less by the end of the movie what happened. \nThis was about the most un christmassy movie I have ever seen.",

    "text": "Ah yes the classic story , hard working career women goes home, meets boy, saves the small business, and just met boy guilts her into giving up her life long dream.\n How Christmas and charming to give up the career shes been training for since childhood, and enjoys, plus makes huge amounts of money for her, for a man she kissed one time.\n Not to mention said butt hurt man, the moment he doesn't think hes getting the girl as his \"you did a good thing trophy\", tries to quit and sabotage the performance that she put together to save the bar, that he called home too. until she of course comes back to stroke his ego and quit all her dreams to kiss him for the second time, because you know that kiss was just too magical, to not give up on everything she loved and worked hard for so selfish to even consider it.\n\nhonesty the movie itself without that cliche wasn't exactly the best, but it was charming, until then at the least. would have been an ok movie if instead he realized \"damn i was a controlling jerk\" and showed up to support her dance career and said something like \" i'm sorry i acted that way, this is your dream , and I love you so however we gotta make this work to be together I'm on board , cause you are my dream\"  that would have been refreshing for one of these movies.\n or she could have gotten an offer from a different city nearby and said she picked that one because she knew the Broadway one was gonna replace her again, as soon as someone younger came along.  or could have just left out the return to dancing option entirely and she decides to open a dance studio in the town.\n The idea a successful independent women quits her entire dream job, with bonus pay, for a man she just met, needs to STOP. though I will give points for realism cause there really are those \"nice guy\" types out there that would think this is how a man ,BOY, should respond to a women not making him the center of her life when he does a nice thing for her ONE time.",
