    "text": "A romcom that doesn\u2019t aim high but somehow manages to deliver. The writing is weak as events unfold in a contrived way rather than through genuine character agency or earned development. The dialogue often feels forced, with the two leads jumping into deep, heartfelt conversations after having just met. Still, as a romcom, it\u2019s not meant to be taken too seriously.\n\nWhere the film truly shines is in its lavish production design and its beautifully shot Irish landscapes. Some might find this idealized portrayal a bit lazy or even disrespectful to Irish culture, but visually, it\u2019s undeniably appealing. Beyond that, the filmmaking feels fairly generic, and while the performances are passable, they never quite stand out.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t particularly recommend it as there are far better films in the genre, but if you\u2019re in the mood for a light, silly romcom with gorgeous Irish scenery and don\u2019t mind mediocre screenwriting, this one might do the trick.",

Her character is literally the least interesting lead I've ever seen and I can't buy her as an actual human being at all. The wardrobe alone, yuck. Sometimes I like cringey movies but this was waaaaay over done. There's an old made for TV movie called the magical land of the leprechauns that is 10 times better than this.",

    "text": "The film is supposed to be hallmark-esk. Lindsay Lohan\u2019s performance in this shows just how charming she is on-screen and why she should be in more A-list projects. She is getting her face back out there to show that she\u2019s still got it! The film is cute. Not very well written and the acting is a little off, but if you are looking for a cute rom-com to watch on a rainy day, this is the one for you.",

It's so bad it's just a blast to watch. Make sure you're watching with friends and you can just rip the whole project to shreds while face-palming for about one and a half hours straight! A Must-See.",

    "text": "Irish Wish - 3/10. Oh no. First of all, Lindsay Lohan deserves so much better than this. The same director that delivered her somewhat mediocre Netflix Christmas film delivers this comically bad romcom. This is literally laughably bad, and its shocking because the christmas themed film the two did previously at least had some tinge of good work in there. Irish Wish is one of those movies that has nothing going for it in a general sense. Lindsay tries her ever so best to make this work, and Ed Speelers actually does a decent job with his scenes with Lindsay here too. Jane Seymour is here, and like Lindsay, is betrayed by a bad script, making some of her performance feel a little goofy. The main issue here is that the movie just feels so artificial, goofy, wooden, and just badly written/directed. I laughed at some of the creative choices taken in the film, and as much as it tried to be funny, it just couldn\u2019t be hilarious to save its own life. I really wanted to like this, because romcoms are my thing. But holy is this really bad. The funny thing is, the fight near the end was probably the only good thing in this entire movie, and even that scene was done in a middling way. The locations are beautiful, and along with the very few things in this movie that work, this is probably gonna be one of the worst films of the year. Lindsay, you deserve so much better than these Netflix movies.",

    "text": "I was honestly genuinely surprised with how much I liked this movie. As Rom-Coms are far and few between in recent years, this is a nice addition to the genre. With breathtaking cinematography in scenic Ireland and Lohan's enigmatic & humane performance making you undoubtedly root for the protagonist - the message of standing up for yourself + making your own destiny is alive and true. It doesn't hurt that the soulmate arch between the two leads is natural and emblematic across the breezy run-time. A heartwarming, comfort film that you shouldn't miss and has tons of replay value!",

This felt like a rushed cliche production, with most scenes fitting more to a tongue in cheek SNL skit than a real attempt. The accents were hard to listen to, the clothes were so far off any Irish culture from any era, and the story only emphasised egos, bad friends, and embarrassing portrayals of love at first sight, yet without chemistry. I had to double check the year with the gender stereotypes and embarrassing clich\u00e9s too. Wow",
