    "text": "This movie was the best hallmark movie I had seen in a very long time. It had some of favourite cast from b99, the characters felt just as silly and nostalgic as I remember christmas movies being when I kid. This type of movie isn\u2019t meant to be over-critiqued, it\u2019s meant to be embraced with open arms, free of judgement, and recognize what the meaning of christmas is again in a world so disconnected from our own communities. I\u2019ve found a lot of joy and comfort in watching this movie, maybe even sparked hope that not all new movies are lifeless and boring. It\u2019s a christmas miracle!",

    "text": "Der Film ist der mit Abstand schlechteste den ich je gesehen habe. Eine schreckliche Kulisse, ein nerviger echt idiotischer Sheriff, d\u00fcmmliche Protagonisten, null gedanklichen Inhalt, richtig miese Satire auf Pretty Woman und ein d\u00fcmmlicher, naiver Hauptdarsteller der, wie der Film schon aussagt, einen hei\u00dfen Schneemann darstellen sollte, was aufgrund der echt schlecht aufgehalten Brustmuskeln, dem d\u00fcmmlichen Gesichtsausdruck, der seltsamen Frisur und der extrem d\u00fcnnen Lippen absolut nicht gelingt. Der Film ist weder liebenswert, noch romantisch noch am\u00fcsant. Wirklich eine unglaubliche Beleidigung f\u00fcr jeden Zuschauer der auch nur einen Hauch von Niveau und Geschmack besitzt. Einfach eine unglaubliche Zeitverschwendung.",

    "text": "once again, a film where the problem is not its premise but rather everything else, a woman who takes care of someone, protecting them and showing them the world, doesn't that sound like a... mother??!, what kind of passions are these?, once again a Swiss cheese film, with holes and holes, a weak script.",

    "text": "Frosty is canonically a lovable idiot. A subtle satire of the Hallmark Christmas movies that is in on the joke, but walks the line so finely that it ironically is a solid version of the feel-good, festive films it is satirizing. While the tongue in cheek aspect might be confusing or even off-putting to the target audience, its unique tone helps distinguish it from the heaps of Christmas movies on streaming services. Dustin Milligan plays a decent himbo made of snow, while Lacey Chabert delivers one of her signature flat performances in straight-to-streaming Christmas films. It\u2019s ultimately the comedic performances of Craig Robinson, Joe Lo Truglio and Katy Mixon Greer that elevate the film.",

Also, seemed like he had three frosty babies rolling around with the strong preexisting dad vibes, lack of chemistry, and the weird bad boy undertones that reminded me in their subtlety of Edward scissor hands\u2026the charm and nuance that make the latter so good. Frosty felt desperate and in a desperate environment. Would watch again very drunk.",

    "text": "Cheesy story about how a snowman figure suddenly coming back to life. Despite it being cheesy, it does fit on the comedy section. There is romance and love that was shown and not overbearing to watch. It nevertheless introduces a woman who missed her husband and then magic helped her found love. There were many funny bits which may seem too much for the older audience, but I understand the necessity of it. It never struck me as how a snowman turns out to be a fast learner and a girl magnet at the same time. Would I watch it again? Maybe not. But is it worth watching for the first time? Sure!",

    "text": "Y'all love those kinds of Christmas rom-com movies?  Well, do I have just the one for you, and this one is gonna make ya feel Hot and Frosty.  Jokes aside, yes, this is what you expect a cliche filled type of Christmas romantic comedy type of movie.  Lonely widow trying to have a heart towards along with a dorky dude that is like Frosty the Snowman but instead of a magical hat, he comes to life from a magical scarf, which isn't explained much except it's just magic.\nNow everyone performed okay as the script goes along with plenty of absurd decisions, but it's just how much of the romantic comedy cheese that you would get.  Of course, the center of attention being Jack, the snowman, being a nice guy while helping everyone in town.  To be fair, how can you hate this guy?  Matter of fact, you can't be mad at everyone when you can get a laugh out of most of the humor in this.\nMovie delivered some charm, delivered some humor and out of all of the cheese that you'd get out of this, you might just have fun with it, if you're bored and just wanted to watch it with your loved one.  Or if you're single and a hopeless romantic, you might also get some enjoyment out of this.\nAt the end of the day, this is certainly how you expect from Netflix making a kind of Hallmark movie that you'd see on occasion.  A bad kind of movie?  Maybe.  Did I still have fun with it?  Sure.  It might as well be one of those so bad, it's good for a handful of folks all around during the Christmas month since this movie screams Christmas romantic comedy.\nI'll give this movie six snowman coming to life, with the magical scarf covering him up out of ten.  6/10.",

However I tried it again with my wife and I have to admit, I had a lot of laughs. \n\nI'm a big fan of the cast chosen for the comedic relief, and they didn't disappoint. That, and the actor that played Jack pulled off a damn fine performance. \n\nOverall, I'm surprised to say it was one I'll watch again! \n\nI also loved that there were so many Canadian performers.",

Dustin Milligan was ripped AF, but also looked like he needed to eat. Lacey Chabert is always very charming. The sheriff was the most annoying thing about the movie. Lauren Holly was hilarious and her role should have been expanded.",

When I show him this movie he is bound to realize we belong together because I am just like the lead girl! (The only difference is that I am not a widow like her!) If only Mark Hansen would say he loved me back like hot frosty did. I also have two cops on my tail like the silly cops in the movie. It took some of the weight off knowing that the town will take my side if the cops ever catch me. Baravissimo to an excellent movie with an excellent lead!",
