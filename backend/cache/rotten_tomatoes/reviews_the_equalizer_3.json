I don't know what the prime cause of the USA shoot shoot shooting each other, but the visuals for a child growing up are Causal. He gone dum, stupid and self righteous.\n\nThere's no story here just shooting and killing and wasshername was a good kid actor but now she's having trouble reading her lines.\n\nA+B=C.        Equalizer 3\n\n\n   I prefer my Formula.",

    "text": "Ok, I ripped the whole series and this is the last one. It's pretty good. Denzel is watchable in just about anything. I am not a fan of them editing the action scenes in such the way they did, but Denzel probably wouldn't have been able to pull the stuff off as he's pretty old now. That being said, the stories cool- this one in Italy and of Drug thugs. The 2nd I might've liked slightly more and the first was pretty good. Gonna keep all of them and this is a rare- they get better- sequel.",

    "text": "I've been a long-time fan of Denzel Washington and enjoyed most of his films. The Equalizer (2014) was a great start \u2014 dark, balanced, and satisfying. The sequel was weaker, but I still hoped the third one would bring the franchise to a proper close. Sadly, I have mixed feelings.\n\nRobert McCall is a fascinating vigilante \u2014 a man seeking redemption through justice. That theme returns strongly here, and it\u2019s where the film truly shines. The slower rhythm, the introspective tone, and the stunning cinematography of southern Italy give the movie a beautiful, almost poetic touch. The small-town interactions and McCall\u2019s conversations with Emma (Dakota Fanning) are among the highlights.\n\nUnfortunately, the story itself feels hollow. The plot seems like an afterthought \u2014 as if someone added random violence to justify calling it an Equalizer movie. The mafia subplot lacks depth and tension; there\u2019s no real sense of danger or challenge. Even McCall\u2019s signature brutality feels off \u2014 still gruesome, but stripped of meaning. When he tells a villain, \u201cYou have six minutes left to live,\u201d it\u2019s supposed to sound menacing, but instead feels forced and clich\u00e9.\n\nIn the end, Equalizer 3 is visually stunning but emotionally empty. It feels less like a thrilling conclusion and more like a quiet farewell that doesn\u2019t know what to say.",

The beautiful Italian back drop give this film a grounded appreciation which grows on you; it doesn\u2019t need the large budget explosions. \n\nI\u2019m very much looking forward, excited to hear Denzel & Fuqua signed on for 2 more sequels. More Dakota and Denzel has proven to be a collaboration that doesn't miss, and we're here for it.",

It's ok for passing a few hours but nothing special or original. \n\nThe protagonist had no character development or story, you don't know anything about him or his history. Certain scenes were completely unrealistic, like the main bad guy beating someone up, punching him full pelt ten times or more then in the next scene his hands are completely fine. \n\nBasically just another good vs bad guys type of film.",
