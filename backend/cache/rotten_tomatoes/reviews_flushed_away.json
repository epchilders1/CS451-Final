    "text": "Although it is not the most perfect out of AardWorks movies, this is some enjoyable movie.\nIt has adventure with a flush down the drain to a city of London where other rats created home. Roddy & Rita made a hood pair after all, he really did belong in the family of her. I wonder where they go in the future.\n\nAnd to add with it, there is comedy, such as references to other movies (\ud83d\udcc0\ud83d\udcbf in James home) & Finding Nemo with a goldfish saying \"Have You Seen My Dad?\", slugs bringing comic relief with their singing. Even our villainous toads have had a comedic part with that one moment \"My fly's undone\" & his backstory made an impact (Charles chose a rat over him)\nAnother part to make it funny: when Tabitha arrived home (who I wanted to see the face of) showed the pet her new cat - that was Sid. She would probably realise she really did overfeed him seeing Sid's appearance & he lowkey trashed the home. The reaction.\nTo say, do we really need rats as pets?\n\nEven the soundtrack hypes me up though",

I rewatch this film every few years expecting to be disappointed due my more developed brain, however I genuinely enjoy it more each watch. Great writing, Great voice acting, fun sets and memorable moments that are sure to make you chuckle. For a movie marketed with toilet humor its surprisingly engaging and memorable and a must watch especially for the youth.",
