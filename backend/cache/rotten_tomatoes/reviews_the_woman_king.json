The main character in this was a leading figure in maintaining the African slave trade. Slavery was the main product of her nation. It was the British navy who began dismantling the slave trade and the African characters lauded in this movie actually opposed them.",

But unfortunately, it piles clich\u00e9 upon clich\u00e9, with weak and worn-out dialogue, simplistic characters and story structure. All of this is drenched in a sauce of semi-heroism and a kind of Disney-esque music in the background. A complete waste of time.",

    "text": "This movie purposefully, intentionally, glosses over and lamp shades how horrible the Dahomey Amazons were. The film memtions some of that hideous history...briefly...but it does not tell you what the Dahomey did after (go back to their old slave trade ways after the palm oil thing did'nt work out). Furthermore, it GREATLY exaggerates their tactile effectiveness against anything but sleeping, unarmed, tribes in the dead of night. Even worse is, it demonizes surrounding tribes. Tribes who by no means were perfect or even morally equitable to our modern standards, but they were far more complex than the cartoonish villians portrayed in this film. The cast is talented but utterly wasted on the film. Ultimently this film is about as bad as \"God's & Generals\" when it comes to romanticizing an aweful group of slavers. Research the history, don't waste time watching this film. Far more entertaining and no amount of Bot-Reviews can change that.",

This is one of the best movies of the year for me, next to Top Gun Maverick of course. This is a highly recommended flick to watch. Don't miss it.",

    "text": "I know this is supposed to be a Viola Davis spectrum but I've got to be honest here. Thuso Mbedu and Lashana Lynch. Stole the show. The trailer makes you feel that this film is all Viola taking the stage to be this elite warrior that breaths the life of Annalise Keating into this late 1800's African Warrior but the real truth is that Thuso sold this film from opening  credit to closing. This review is no shade toward Viola but I've got to give credit where credit is due. This film has an incredible story line with a twist. Definitely recommend this as a great way to remind us all of the tyranny the African Slave's has to endure during the treacherous times of the European colonizers ravaged tribe after tribe. 4.1/5",
