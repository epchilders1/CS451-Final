Surprisingly, the werewolves have taken a dire turn in this franchise which is a crying shame because their presence in the two other films were refreshing and light handed. In one of the worst scenes ever, they all confront each other through telepathy which is hard to watch because the voice acting is so out of place. The wedding scene was gratuitous and the birth scene was ripped out from the pages of hell. Bizzare.",

    "text": "Breaking Dawn: Part One continues the Twilight saga at a time when the fanbase was still buzzing, and anticipation was high. But in hindsight\u2014and especially when revisiting the series as a whole\u2014this film easily stands out as the weakest of the franchise up to that point. It\u2019s not just slow; it\u2019s dramatically thin, emotionally flat, and narratively stretched to the breaking point.\n\nThe story picks up with Bella and Edward\u2019s long-awaited wedding, followed by their honeymoon and the shock of Bella\u2019s mysterious pregnancy. While this should have been a pivotal, emotionally charged chapter, it feels oddly lifeless and meandering. The film spends a large chunk of its runtime on drawn-out wedding scenes, honeymoon montages, and melodramatic gazes that don\u2019t add much depth to the story. The pacing drags badly, especially in the middle act, and you\u2019re left wondering why the studio felt this particular book needed to be split into two movies beyond the obvious financial motivation.\n\nKristen Stewart\u2019s performance\u2014unfortunately a recurring issue throughout the saga\u2014is at its most lifeless here. She continues to deliver lines with little emotion or range, making it nearly impossible to connect with Bella\u2019s inner turmoil. Even during moments of fear, conflict, or physical pain (like the pregnancy and birth scenes), Stewart\u2019s expression barely shifts. It\u2019s frustrating, because the film requires its lead actress to sell incredibly heavy emotional stakes, and instead we get someone who looks like she\u2019s trying to stay awake.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Stewart\u2014Robert Pattinson looks increasingly uncomfortable with the material, while Taylor Lautner\u2019s scenes often feel like filler. There\u2019s a real lack of chemistry across the board, and it\u2019s hard to feel invested when it seems like even the actors are just going through the motions. The tension between the vampire and werewolf clans should be at a boiling point, but instead it plays out with eye rolls, shirtless stares, and brooding standoffs.\n\nThere are still a few positives. The wedding scene, while overlong, is beautifully shot. Carter Burwell\u2019s score brings a sense of melancholy that helps some scenes land better than they otherwise would. The visual effects during Bella\u2019s transformation and the birth scene, while still rough in places, at least attempt something cinematic and unsettling. And the film\u2019s final shot\u2014Bella opening her eyes as a newborn vampire\u2014does promise a more exciting chapter ahead.\n\nBut overall, Breaking Dawn: Part One is a slog. It leans too heavily into melodrama, devotes too much time to unimportant details, and fails to give us any real momentum until the final ten minutes. It feels like a placeholder\u2014something you sit through for the sake of reaching the actual conclusion in Part Two. For a story with such high emotional stakes, it\u2019s shockingly void of passion or urgency.\n\nIf you\u2019re rewatching the series, you\u2019ll need to watch this one for continuity. But otherwise, Breaking Dawn: Part One is the definition of skippable. It\u2019s not just a weak chapter in the saga\u2014it\u2019s a perfect example of how splitting a final book into two films can sometimes do more harm than good.",

    "text": "I get it now....I do...these movies are basically the equivalent of a trashy daytime soap opera on the big screen. I'll give it this man at least it doesn't look as dull as other entries do and has good lighting but even still with that fixed the cinematography still isn't good. It's the acting which isn't also, is the biggest problem. There is no emotion in any of these performances, the dialoueg lowkey isn't good, everyone is so wooden, and forgettable. This leads to a dragged out pacing which isn't good either. It feels like the whole getting married, honeymoon, and the baby which in a good movie would take 10-15 minutes to cover takes over a bloody hour here. It literally is dragged out like a soap opera. Everything else is ok I guess. I get the flow of events and there fine enough but there's no character development at all or it's dragged out terribly. The whole final conflict with the werewolves and vampires feels like it never gets the focus it needs or ties in because the stupid romance takes way too long. I'm not kidding when I say literally the other dozen or so characters all blend in terribly here so much I can't tell you anything about them. I really struggle to say even if you made through the first three to say go for this. Just stop honestly. Watch any of the Hunger Games movies or any other good vampire movie.",
