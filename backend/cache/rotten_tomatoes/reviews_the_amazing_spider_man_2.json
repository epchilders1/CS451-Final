    "text": "I probably enjoyed this movie than most people here, but I can still see that the problem with this is that there are too many voices behind the story. The way this story added intricate details to the origin of Spider-Man was consistent with the first part and felt like it cared about being a proper sci-fi. But then the whole character of Electro, which became the weakest part of the movie, is written so lazily in every way that you can clearly see the same person didn't come up with both of them. Despite all the issues this movie had, it also had Andrew and Emma under the direction of 500 Days of Summer, so the romantic portions were great. For most of the movie, it was at its best when it was focused on Peter rather than Spider-Man, and I loved it. As much as a lot of the movie didn't work, there was a lot of stuff that worked really, really well for me. And watching these old Spider-Man movies, all of them always had some scenes that were cool af in a way that the MCU never even tried, and I am glad I got to see it in the theatres. That last slow mo shot of them falling and that web shaping into a hand, how can I not like this!\n\nMarc Webb and Andrew Garfield deserved better, and I am sad this was the end of this iteration. And yeah, Andrew is the best Spidey, no doubt about it.",

Pero destaca por sus efectos especiales, el nuevo traje y de nueva cuenta la relaci\u00f3n de Peter y Gwen.\n\nFue repudiada por todos principalmente porque no estaba a la altura de otras grandes pel\u00edculas de super h\u00e9roes ya existentes que dejaron la vara muy alta. A\u00fan con todo eso es sin duda mil veces mejor que lo que entrega marvel ahora; productos mediocres y carentes de personalidad que los fans hacen pasar como la resurrecci\u00f3n del cine de super h\u00e9roes.

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nOverlong, overstuffed, and emotionally hollow, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 drowns in its own ambition. What could have been a thrilling continuation of Peter Parker\u2019s story instead collapses under a bloated plot, forced franchise setup, and inconsistent tone.\n\nAndrew Garfield and Emma Stone\u2019s chemistry is the film\u2019s only saving grace, bringing fleeting warmth to an otherwise cold and chaotic movie. Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro is a visually striking but painfully underwritten villain, while Dane DeHaan\u2019s Green Goblin feels rushed and cartoonish. The film juggles too many subplots\u2014corporate conspiracies, tragic love, villain origins\u2014without giving any of them the time or care they deserve.\n\nDespite flashes of potential and a few impressive action sequences, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ultimately feels more like a studio checklist than a cohesive story. It\u2019s a disappointing, noisy misfire that smothers its emotional core beneath CGI sparks and tangled storytelling.",
