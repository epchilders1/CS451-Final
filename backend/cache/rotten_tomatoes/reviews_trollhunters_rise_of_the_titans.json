I enjoyed how it kind of mixed all three series together. But I am very disappointed by the ending. It made me feel like watching hours of this series meaningless \nSpoiler alert:\nToby is the new troll hunter??? That is not how you end a movie",

    "text": "SPOILERS: Mostly just reactions to negative comments.\n\nThis was a beautiful action packed ending to a great series. \n\nFor the reviews saying that they hated Jim's outlook and the fact that he doubted himself so much don't understand how much pain Jim went through in the series before. From being earth mightiest hero, to having his amulet destroyed, becoming a troll, being stabbed in the heart, and controlled by dark magic. It weighs heavy on your mind and you soul, and it made for an amazing redemption when he finally unlocked the amulet and wielded Excalibur! All that build up for 4 minutes of glory lol To me to was very much worth it, I can relate to Jim in so many ways.\n\nFor those saying they felt like many characters were \"nerfed\" in this series like Douxie, Aya (especially her character and decision making) need to check the title of the movie again. It's the Trollhunters-Rise of the Titans. In Wizards Jim and the 3 Below cast has to take the backseat. And in 3 Below the Trollhunters had to take the backseat. I think Douxie played a great role, and Aya seeing her planet destroyed wanted to save as many people as she could. I also literally laughed out loud when Steve was impregnated, and I rarely belch out like that. \n\nNow for the negative , I personally disliked that Toby will become the next Trollhunter. I feel that will distort time in a major way and Jim is taking a huge unnecessary risk. Toby had always been happy with his role until the end of the movie when he felt underpowered and out of place. \n\nBUT the good thing about the ending is they left it open for the audience to interpret the next chapters for themselves. All in all, a great movie though the ending was a little offsetting.",

On top of that, the whole subplot of Steve and Aja having kids ended up just being weird, and the ending just made everything meaningless. It was mostly fun and kinda good, but overall mid",
