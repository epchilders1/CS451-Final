    "text": "Just when you think Tyler Perry can not possibly make a dumber movie, he works assiduously to prove you wrong!  He has done it once again.\nTyler Perry has been making movies for 30 years and is a Billionaire.  He could clearly make better movies if he so desired.  Sadly, he knows there is a certain audience that will turn out for this detritus so he does not have to improve his craft to make tons of money.\nTrevante Rhodes looks/sounds like he is about to fall asleep in every scene.  He has been accused of murdering his girlfriend and is faced with the possibility of life in prison but, he shows exactly ZERO emotion/feeling when he is discussing his case.\nKelly Rowland's character is a high-powered attorney in a white shoe firm yet, her character does some of the dumbest things in cinema history.\nFor an affair to take place, especially one fraught with so much risk and danger, you have to feel at least a modicum of heat between the parties.  Here, there is zero chemistry/heat between these two characters.\nAnd, Perry has proven he can not create characters with a modicum of nuance.  The bad characters are all way over the top.  The mother is completely repulsive and her boys are one-dimensional.\nThe first 90 minutes are fairly boring with \"tension\" supposedly building as to whether Zyair actually murdered his girlfriend or not.  But, he does not seem to really care so it's hard for the audience to get to invested in the outcome.\nAnd, then the completely insane final 25 minutes of the movie that is so far afield from everything that has proceeded it, you are like, \"Is this a different movie from what I just watched??\"  It's like someone wrote the final 25 minutes who had only some vague awareness of the first 90 minutes.  It creates a real feeling of whiplash it is so extreme, unbelievable and just incredibly stupid!  Dear Tyler Perry - Please do better!  You consistently turn out projects that insult your audiences.  After 30 years and with an unlimited budget, you could actually make movies that make sense, have believable characters and intellectually challenge your audiences.  Please, for the love of God, do better!!",

The dialogue is so awful its no surprise how stiff the delivery is.\n\nI did not even realize it was Kelly Rowland until after the movie when i was trying to figure out how the actress got the role.",

Between the stupid FL (and when i say stupid, shes the-first-one-to-die-in-a-horror-movie dumb), the dumb ass mama boy husband, the private investigator who does half of the job, the wacko brother- and mother-in-law. It's just so not realistic that I have nothing to say but that this movie is extremely bad. But truck-kun helped us in the end.",

The approach Tyler Perry took with this movie is very different from the past when it comes to the color scheme, and artistic visuals. This was BEAUTIFULLY written, amazingly produced and shot. 10/10 absolutely amazing actors and props to Kelly Rowland and Trevante Rhodes",
