    "text": "Solid action flick. Gal Gadot is on fine form, and this film isn't afraid to let her get a bit of blood and grit on her, especially in her final few fight scenes. The film has heart (no pun intended). My one complaint would be that I felt it needed to be longer--a few character motivations and plot beats were left a bit thin, and with a slightly longer runtime I do think Rachel Stone's story could have reached its full potential. Still, as far as Netflix films go, this one flew by. Now if only they'd translate the French.",

    "text": "I don't believe they were attempting to sell anything beyond a typical action movie here, so if that was their intention, they certainly succeeded! I went into it without expectations, and it turned out to be enjoyable, exactly what you anticipate from a movie like this.\n\nThe writing was a bit weak, which is a common trait in almost any action movies. However, there were two aspects that stood out and aren't typically seen in such films. Firstly, there was no excessively long fight scene where characters (especially women) are hit multiple times and keep on fighting. This was quite refreshing.\n\nSecondly, they actually addressed the injuries sustained by the characters. In many movies, the main character gets hurt, but is miraculously fine just moments later. In this film they show the character's injuries and exhaustion throughout the entire movie. I thought this was well-executed, which is why I gave it a rating of 3.",

There was no intimacy it was all non-stop action, so bordering on a little crazy.  Bond movies do stuff similar but this was not Bond-worthy.  And Gal needs a love interest.  \n\nSo, all in all, it was free to watch so it was ok, if i had to pay $20+ $20 for popcorn and a Coke, it woulda been a waste.\n\nWorth watching if you have nothing better to do.. !",
