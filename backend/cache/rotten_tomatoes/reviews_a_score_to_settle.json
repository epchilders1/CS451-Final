No idea what cliches 1 guy saw and the detroit critic just sounds like he'd be a bore to hang out with. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb Oye!!! \ud83d\ude01",

The character Dragon was sub par, but the reveals toward the end made it interesting and the suspense gradually built to a satisfying climax in the third act.",

The story itself feels like the writer gave up halfway through and then said \"what if mental illness?\" and the ending just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Your time would be better spent looking for something else to watch then to sit through this.",

    "text": "That poster makes it look way more crazy that it actually is, I gotta say.\n\n'A Score to Settle' isn't one I'd personally recommend. It does attempt to portray some interesting things with the lead character, though all in all it is quite meekly done and doesn't quite come out right; in my opinion, of course. Nicolas Cage is at least a good screen presence, naturally. He is the only plus point I have for this film.\n\nThe rest of the cast aren't the best, they are all rather disappointing in fact - no-one behind Cage sticks in my memory. The biggest negative I have for this movie, though, is the lack of entertainment. For an \"action thriller\" built on a revenge storyline, barely anything happens until the very end - and even then, it's quite underwhelming.\n\nThere are far better productions from this genre and from this lead actor out there, no doubt about it.",

If someone killed my child while I was doing time for them the first thing I do is kill their kid and then them. No bs talking. Just plain revenge! Don't waste your time",

    "text": "I am a big Nicolas Cage fan, but even he could not save this movie from itself. The movie is poorly written, plagued by bad acting, has a very tired/used-up concept and plot, and developed at a slow pace. The only positive thing in this movie was a major and clever plot twist in the second half. That twist changed the whole perspective on what was going on. I thought it was pretty smart. That's the only good thing I will remember from the movie. Also, to be fair, the movie became more interesting and the tempo picked up in the last 20 minutes. Overall though, it's a forgettable movie. But, if you're a big Nicolas Cage fan like myself, you might find this movie to be watchable. If you're not a big Nicolas Cage fan, I would skip this movie altogether because you'll be very disappointed. I can almost guarantee it.",
