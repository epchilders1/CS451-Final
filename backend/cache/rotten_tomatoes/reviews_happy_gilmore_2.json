    "text": "Happy Gilmore 2 is exactly what happens when you mix nostalgia, rage issues, and golf ....again.... and somehow it works...again. Adam Sandler slips back into Happy like he never left, swinging clubs, punching people, and emotionally confusing every golfer within a five-mile radius. The jokes hit, the cameos land, and the movie reminded me that deep down I will always root for an angry man with a hockey stick pretending to be an athlete. It\u2019s dumb, warm, chaotic comfort food\u2026 basically the cinematic equivalent of a Happy Gilmore swing: completely wrong form, somehow perfect anyway.",

    "text": "I loved the first Happy Gilmore movie. It's a run-of-the-mill Adam Sandler flick that I choose to watch countless times. And when I saw this one on Netflix, I was vastly disappointed with everything about this film.\n\nThe story, the writing, the countless unnecessary cameos and flashback references, all that shoved into one movie just takes me out of it, and it becomes a bloated mess. I'll start with the positives; Adam Sandler. He's probably the best part of the whole movie... and that's it.\n\nHappy Gilmore 2 is genuinely one of the worst movies of 2025, I felt so upset watching this movie, it's ridiculous.",

If you go in knowing what to expect, it's actually an enjoyable ride.\n\nHappy Gilmore 2:\n- A thin plot with an over-the-top villain\n- Loads of cameos\n- Dozens of callbacks to the first film (including children of deceased characters)\n- Adam Sandler being his goofy self (just older)\n- A mindless, yet fun ride\n\nLately, I've tried to have all of my reviews start at a 5/10 (2.5 stars) then I go up or down a point based on the positives and negatives. I'll tell you this, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and the positive outweighed the negatives. 6/10.\n\nBest Character: Oscar and his cousin Esteban\nBest Scene: Training",

    "text": "This years-later sequel is driven by a simple and convenient premise\u2026. A retired Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) must return to competition in the sport he once dominated in order to provide for his family. The result is predictable and offers nothing new, but it does allow for a nostalgic revisit of characters and actors of a certain comic era through the many cameos the populate its telling.",

    "text": "The price is wrong Bob! Let me start by saying, it's a good family film. It is not a Good Sequel Or A Good Sandler movie, obviously Time changes all things, and I guess that's the same rule applied to \"Happy Gilmore 2\" . Adam Sandler Is In this movie, that's all I can think to say, About His performance in this film, The original is definitely a defining moment for Saturday Night Live's Star alumni, but this update on the story, feels more like a Slap in the face ,  especially to the The people who Grew up On the Golden Era of \"Happy Madison\" Films. \nThat's not to say they didn't try. . . \nThey did, try to throw as many Celebrity Cameos in the Two hour Screen Time as possible , Sandler feels tired and kinda over His own character, The motivation of the whole situation for Happy feels strong enough to motivate a sort of effort from the character, but after you see the fourteenth alcohol Bottle, Camouflaged As a Golf club, you'll start to wonder a little, just how important the actual plot is to the momentum of the Film. And how much is the main point or just moving us to the next Cameo / Off color joke. The jokes are not the same anymore, but so much has changed from the first movie, that it makes sense, but also is just a sad realization to think they probably got a lot of studio notes handed to the \"sandman\" making it more appropriate for the time period.  The actual professional golfers and the Big Bad Carry the majority of this movie, with actual plot. Some of the Cameos, have more to do, than our Hero. It's odd. . . Even Sandlers real daughters do more for the plot . On that note I'll leave you with this, it is a solid family film , with a great cast surrounding a paper thin plot, \"The Sandman\" Is barely in His own Movie. It's a good Late night watch if you can't sleep, but it is not a good sequel , and the comedy shows through with the energy of two little boys, flicking each other . At first it's funny but after a while it gets old and the level of Slapstick is definitely leveled down and so I can't say watch it. Cause it's not really a good comedy movie and it's not a safe family movie.",

    "text": "Movie sequels are a hard thing to pull off.  Sure, many sequels are considered \"successful\" because they're profitable, but their box office earnings don't accurately reflect their quality.\n\nA good sequel finds a way to extend the storyline of its predecessor without just relying on what made the initial movie great.  There has to be some sort of fresh take on the characters or plot that draws you back in so that you become just as invested in the sequel as you were in the original.\n\nThe list of sequels that managed to pull this off is short.  In terms of being commercially and critically successful, films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part 2, The Dark Knight, and Empire Strikes Back come to mind.  There are a handful more I could cite, but for the sake of brevity, I'll end with those examples.\n\nSo, where does Happy Gilmore 2 fall in the spectrum of the criteria for a worthwhile sequel?  After watching it, I'd say this is more of a film cashing in on the nostalgia of the characters rather than something genuinely unique.\n\nIn terms of success, Happy Gilmore 2 set a record for the strongest opening weekend in Netflix U.S. history with 46.7 million views in its first three days.  Sadly, impressive numbers don't run parallel with quality.\n\nI'd sum up the plot of the film, but that seems to be secondary to the number of cameos and callbacks to the first film, so I'll refrain from trying to decipher what necessitated a part two in this franchise.\n\nSometimes all you need is one film.  Then, allow the audience to fill in the gaps of where the story goes or how the characters evolve.  Otherwise, you run the risk of corrupting something that is held dear by many.\n\nI love the original Happy Gilmore movie.  I tolerated the sequel out of sheer curiosity.  Unfortunately, I walk away wishing that I hadn't found out what happened next.",

    "text": "Honestly not that bad. I expected that it would be a bit unwatchable, just trying to relive the original movie and doing all the same antics. That said the movie did just that, but I felt like the story was good and some of the jokes were genuinely funny. My buddy is into golf and that definitely helped with making the movie more funny as he was calling out all the real golfers in the movie. Additionally by smartly adding these real golfers it opened up jokes for things about their careers and general silly moments from real golfers, not just actors/cameos. That being said the call backs and cameos were very heavy. I haven't really watched the original in a while so thankfully I missed a bunch of the call backs, but even as a casual enjoyer there were still more than I would have liked. Additionally the cameos were just ridiculous. It was like someone said, hey wouldn't it be funny if we put Guy Fieri as an announcer? And then that made the final cut. No Flavortown jokes, but just hey that is silly its Guy Fieri. And same for 100s of others. Seems like the kind of movie it would have been amazing to film, but from a watchers perspective it was just trying too hard.",
