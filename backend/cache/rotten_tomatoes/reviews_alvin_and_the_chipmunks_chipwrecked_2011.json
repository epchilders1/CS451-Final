I rate this one good. It can\u2019t compare to the first two movies. The first two were awesome.\nSpoil Alert\nThey go on a boat. Alvin causes problems of course. Dave punishing them of course but doesn\u2019t work really. They fly a kite and accidentally get separated from Dave. The chipmunks and girl chipmunks get stranded on an island having to learn how to survive. Simon turns into a romancer for Janette. Along the way meet a lady. They all become friends with her until later on Dave and Ian find the Island. The lady\u2019s true colors comes out when she sees gold that\u2019s the whole reason why she came to the island. Chipnapping Janette to get gold for herself. With the help from Alvin Janette is free. Everyone gets off the island before the Valcano explodes. Janette forgives the lady. Then they go perform.",

Masterfully crafted story, very intense with increasingly high stakes compared to the other movies. Incredible action and beautiful script, I could talk forever about how good this movie is. Acting is also extremely impressive and the humans interact splendidly with the chipmunks. Love this movie \ud83d\ude1c",
