Most of the movie is the complete opposite of what happened in the book, and there were things in the movie that never happened in the book.\nIf you are watching without reading the book, this would be a 3/5, good story line, but extremely sped up from what it was.",

Some reviewers seem to think the story is pretty far-fetched, but having flown in small planes through the Rockies in good weather, I can tell you the fear of such an accident is very real. I do think an experienced pilot wouldn't fail to file a flight plan, but otherwise it could happen.  If I had to be in a crash, I'd hope to have a doctor with me like Ben.\n\nThe two stars in this movie have interesting chemistry, they are both really good actors and combined with the beautiful mountain scenery, it's worth a viewing.",

If you like predictable and cartoonish romances driven by circumstance and survival stories, perhaps you'll like this. Then again, you may also enjoy appreciating the main main actors. :)",

A lot of the times you could guess what would happen, and it was a bit long. But it still had some very good elements. I loved the actors and it was some very nice shots throughout the movie.

    "text": "Firstly, no woman ever has come down in a plane crash, is on a survival mission, and is still wearing her bra (unless strictly necessary) several days later. We can't even wait to get home from the office to get rid of this thing. This may have been overlooked by whoever made that decision about this film. It is however a dumb but not too painful holiday movie if you like Kate Winslet and can suffer a Hallmark style movie. I'm not familiar with Idris but he did a lot of the heavy lifting and given Kate is a great actress, I can only assume she wanted to tick this kind of nonsense off her list. I will be writing a spoiler if I write what kind of Mills & Boon outcome I want at a certain point in the movie.",

(The American flag in the old cabin\u2019s window is a huge boo\u2014as if we who live in this wild and gorgeous country wouldn\u2019t recognize it.) Knowing Winslet\u2019s penchant for films that end badly for the protagonists, I was surprised and pleased by the gentle and rather natural conclusion. Of course one counts on Idris Elba to bring his magic, and he sure does. THE DOG LIVES. R",

The plot, however, is straight out of a paperback novella you may find in an airport bookshop. The survival scenario just seems poorly conceived, the romance forced, the revelation about his past - predictable, the cabin in the woods - fortuitous. Really low brow stuff for a cast from the upper echelons of hollywood",
