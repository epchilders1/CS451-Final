    "text": "As someone who has worked in radio for over 25 years as both an on-air DJ and behind the scenes in production, whenever I see a movie that puts that branch of media on display, I'm always intrigued to see the direction they decide to focus on for the film.\n\nThis particular movie isn't necessarily breaking new ground as Mel Gibson plays loud-mouth shock jock Elvis Cooney, who finds his audience among those listening during the graveyard shift.\n\nUp until the ultimate twist in the last 15 minutes, I found myself enjoying the setup and execution of the basic plot, which sees a disgruntled caller talking out his frustrations on the over-the-top disc jockey.  It held my attention even in moments that I thought were absurd or downright ridiculous. \n\nThe momentum they built during the first two-thirds of the movie had the potential to lead to a climactic ending that was creative and unique.  Instead, I sat disappointed as I watched what played out before me.\n\nGiven his reputation over the past 15-20 years, I'll give Gibson credit for playing an easily dislikable shock jock.  He seemed to fill those shoes relatively easily.\n\nAs far as the authenticity of a working radio environment?  Well, considering automation runs just about everything nowadays, I had to suspend my disbelief that there would be an office of people working the overnight shift at a real commercial radio station.\n\nDon't go in with high hopes.  Just turn off your brain and enjoy this film for what it is:  a movie about a shock jock that tries to shock you.\n\nOr, maybe watch \"Play Misty For Me\" instead.",

    "text": "Was just on Netflix looking for something short, and came across this one. Thought the premise was interesting when I read it, and I got about what I expected. Nothing really that crazy, but nothing terrible. Story was something I haven't seen before, and I thought it was fine. Wasn't a fan of the writing tho. Also wish we had a bit more time to develop the characters. I thought the twists were fun too. Just very middle of the road for me.",

This is not an Oscar worthy movie but the time is not wasted at all. Good movie, that keeps you engaged and at the edge of your seat. Highly recommended watch.",

    "text": "It feels like the writer of this script was fired before they finished writing it, and they had to hire an amateur to finish it. The movie was decent thriller right up until the last 10 minutes. Then it gets destroyed by its double \"twist\" ending.  The first twist absolutely no one sees coming, but the second is so obvious it hurts. I'm so glad I watched tis at 1.5x speed so I at least didn't waste as much time as the average viewer. Bah!",

I watched it with my girlfriend who said this was an ALRIGHT movie and I will NEVER EVER EVER get these 2 hours of my life back. My lifespan was shortened by 2 hours. If I wanted to die this is how I would go. Watching this pathetic excuse for a movie!!!!! 1/10 stars. DO NOT WATCH",
