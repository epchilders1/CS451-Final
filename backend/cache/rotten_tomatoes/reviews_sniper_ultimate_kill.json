The lead actor who plays the star sniper has completely won me over; I\u2019m in love with his performance. His father\u2019s character is also amazing and really adds to the story. I\u2019ve watched this movie over and over again. The only downside for me is Danay Garcia\u2019s character \u2014 I didn\u2019t care for her attitude in the film. But overall, it\u2019s a great watch!",

    "text": "The music for the film doesn't have a signature and the script still loses its grasp on past characters, but this is almost nothing worth being disappointed over. The script in this feature handles much more material as opposed to past sequels. The camerawork is great to look at, along with having Tom Berenger and Billy Zane finally reunite once again is the greatest feat of them all.\n\nFor my full review of Sniper: Ultimate Kill (2017), check it out on this IMDB link: https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4432558/?ref_=ur_urv",
