    "text": "A Predictable Sci-Fi Letdown.\n\nSpiderhead is a sterile sci-fi thriller that squanders its intriguing premise with a predictable plot and shallow characters, turning potential moral horror into forgettable procedural drudgery. Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Abnesti hints at menace, but the script flattens him into a generic experimenter, while Miles Teller\u2019s Jeff and Jurnee Smollett\u2019s Ver\u00f3nica are passive pawns in endless trials. The sleek facility visuals tease claustrophobia, but the pacing crawls through repetitive scenes, and twists land with thudding obviousness. What could have been a chilling dive into consent and humanity devolves into a glossy slog, wasting Saunders\u2019 satirical bite on unearned pathos and flat dialogue. It\u2019s a middling misfire that traps its talented cast in a narrative as confining as its prison, offering no escape from tedium.",

    "text": "Director Joseph Kosinski has a modest directing career, that is in terms of releases: debuting with Gears of War: Mad World (IMDb 8.3), short after, the mostly successful Oblivion (IMDb 7), and, looking at his record, seems like he delivers one banger after another. Until Spiderhead, so it seems. \n\nSpiderhead builds a heavy premise around its story with the presence of strong leads like Miles Teller and Chris Hemsworth, the promise of a strong film, I mean, why would such talents, stars accept a low-value entry in the industry. To some degree, I felt this film held its ground, but it definitely missed on some aspects, which is interesting considering that George Saunders, the writer of the short story that this film is based on, was an advisor to the screenwriters. \n\nLet\u2019s star on a good note. \n\nSpiderhead is thrilling and holds your grip. The central plot is smart enough, keeps us hooked to know what will happen in the end with our protagonist, Jeff. \n\nJeff is a cool guy, but we know he is in this prison facility for something bad, at least bad according to him as he keeps punishing himself mentally about the deed. He just wants to get his redemption and be gone, one way or another. A nice protag to root for. \n\nThe plot is good, gripping. And, here, I need to address the misleading synopsis on IMDb: Jeff does not start questioning his feelings, he questions the experiment itself. The main plot is about this experiment that Dr. Abnesti runs on volunteered convicts to test drugs that affect emotions. Volunteers get privileges on this remote penitentiary called Spiderhead in trade of taking part into increasingly weird experiments. Jeff is cool with this until he starts wondering how far would Abnesti and the Committee Board go with the experiments to get results on a new drug called N-40. \n\nReads like a suspense thriller, but Director Kosinski reasons unknown decided for a corky sci-fi dark humorous thriller. Lighthearted audience should find it entertaining to see Hemsworth play a funny-wannabe villain, but I'm with the audience that like seriousness for the most part \u2014 comedic relief is awesome if done right. Things get pretty bizarre, but the film shrugs it off as like yeah, another day, another experiment, amirite? The trailer makes this even clearer. Endurable, but I would have preferred more seriousness. \n\n \n\nAnother detractor relates to the cliches. After the midpoint revelation, the story gets simpler quickly.  The way the subplot will merge with the main plot becomes self-evident fast, and neither performance could improve on this obviousness. \n\nOne plot point by the middle of the movie hints at either missed opportunities or removed content, a huge shame. I was expecting when that point would culminate into a huge problem, because the film showed me that as a fact, but nope, it just gets dismissed, and that happens mainly due to the simplification of the climax and denouement.  \n\nSo, yeah, Spiderhead entertains, it is unique in its cinematography style, and premise is pretty good. The performance is acceptable and recommendable, nothing wrong with this movie on inadmissible levels, it is just not golden; silver, though.",

    "text": "If an experimental drug is conceptually involved, then the directorial grasp should remain firm to avoid succumbing to the haze. Director Joseph Kosinski adapted what led to believe an interesting experiment regarding drugged-impacted reactive emotions suggestibly aim as coping mechanisms, but the disconnected misalignment starts to build up rather routinely in simmering the supposed thrill, affecting the characterization to an extent, albeit impressive performances with Hemsworth\u2019s accented transformation in particular.

    "text": "It's engaging enough, well acted and mostly interesting but it's not perfect. The pacing is uneven, there simply isn't enough story to justify the length. I feel like for the first hour that we got it way sooner than the film makers thought we would. What is interesting is really interesting but there is too much of nothing where you think you know where it is going. Thankfully the cast do such a good job that it's worth watching. The production design, camera work, sound design etc is great. The core story and concept is also good but would be better suited as a long short film or part of an anthology. A few aspects of the film didn't fit, like some of the actions seemed forced but this was so minor. Overall average film, nothing memorable but also not bad, so middle of the road I don't know what else to say!",
