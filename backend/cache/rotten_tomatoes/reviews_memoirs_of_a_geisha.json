However, there was only ONE scene in which was confusing, from the main character cutting herself, and the movie not explaining why. Other than that, TOTALLY WORTH A WATCH!!!!!!",

    "text": "I would give this movie a 8.6/10. The scenes displayed Japan\u2019s beautiful landscape and integrated the music to bring out the emotional impact. The main character spoke with a well-crafted dialogue showing her intelligence. The antagonist (Hatsumomo) was quite a bully, she felt threatened by Chiyo\u2019s water eyes. Chiyo\u2019s arc really started from the bottom and rose to the top with years of pain and grit. Overall, I liked the movie and would recommend watching it.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\n\nThis movie does not get a 10 because there were some things missing. What was the connection between Chiyo\u2019s father and the Okiya? What happened to Chiyo\u2019s sister? What happened to Hatsumomo after she had crashed out? Why did Nobu forgive Chiyo after the island? There were gaps in the movie.",

    "text": "While it's an absolutely gorgeous film, and acted quite superbly by Ziyi Zhang, and the incomparable Michelle Yeoh, the film hasn't aged well in the last twenty years. Wrought with melodrama, the film only pulls the most tantalizing portions of the source material, and choosing to portray some of the books more nuanced characters as catty, contemptuous, and petty. Most of the antagonists are so comically villainous, the absurdity of it all just completely takes you out of what was supposed to be a well crafted re-telling of the complex lives of Geisha. That's the mid-2000's for ya. Make it pretty, and make it trashy. This is a story that deserves to be told again, with a far more capable director, screenwriter, and even in mini series format. And hey, here's an idea. Maybe actual Japanese women?",

Not sure as to the reason, but as someone who grew up watching this, I can say nostalgia certainly plays a part in my high opinion of the movie. I've always found it quite beautiful, and stirs within a sort of melancholy that keeps me rewatching it every handful of years.",

Even though some scenes are disturbing the traumatic impact is also on the screen! This is a beautifully artistic and spiritual viewing experience, an absolute must see!",

It's on par with any other great movie in the history of cinema.",

    "text": "A 2005 epic period drama directed by Rob Marshall and adapted from the 1997 novel of the same name by Arthur Golden that tells the story of a young Japanese girl sold by her impoverished family to a geisha house (okiya) to support them by training as and eventually becoming one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. A visually stunning film with lovely music by the one and only John Williams that is just breathtaking, an entrancing and emotional tale about sacrifice and hardship and the challenges posed before and after WWII for a geisha of that time. Powerful acting despite the controversial decisions to cast non-Japanese actresses, and the cinematography is just marvellous (no wonder it won an Oscar, along with other two categories: Production and Costume Design.) Delving into Japanese history and culture through the eyes of this young girl was really beautiful and enlightening.",

    "text": "A story about a Japanese geisha where the main three leading lady parts are played by Chinese actors and in English. It looked weird from the beginning and I had to read up on it. Good thing I did and find out how much of a distorted picture of geishas the film portrays. Zang Ziyi, Michelle Yeoh, Gong Li are all great actresses who I've loved in their other works. And with Ken Watanabe too, they made a great cast to watch. The cinematography and the costumes were beautifully done. But all these are constantly making the actual story secondary with how it treats the subject. The film has enough research to make it look like it almost got it right but then changed the foundation of a lot of things as they liked. A lot of the costumes and stuff were actually recognizable to me as something so close to the actual culture but clearly different from it. It is a very Westernized view of the Japanese that doesn't wish to admit that. The story is both a more cruel and distorted version of things at times and overromanticizing of atrocities at other times. It really shows the perverted gaze of the white men who wrote it more than anything. There is an enjoyable movie underneath all these issues, but the movie constantly shows you aspects of it that say firmly that it is not meant to be sympathetic to anyone. Even if you look over everything else, the way it ends and the last monologue makes it even more despicable. Writing this much, I'm wondering if my rating is a bit liberal. It did have great acting, music and cinematography, so should give props to that. So, I'm sure that the actual book would be way worse than this.",
