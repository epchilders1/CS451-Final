And not because of the \"triggering/uncomfortable\" scenes. \nUsually those scenes are certainly hard to watch, but in this movie the scenes felt forced to add to the realness but I felt it lacked depth, and seemed cheap and clich\u00e9 which is hard to say for r*pe scenes.\nI love Mila Kunis, but I found her acting in this quite unwatchable; the inner dialog was even worse. \nMovie had potential, but I think the casting and pacing could've been much better.",

She should stick to comedy. A stilted script and the fact that the actress playing the younger version of Kunis looks absolutely nothing like her didn't help.",

The flippant internal dialogue of the main character make it a little lighter--it is not a mistake. The main character is an \"unreliable narrator\" and in this story we get to witness her transformation. Intense, but healing--for those who are ready to go where this film can take you.",

    "text": "\"Luckiest Girl Alive,\" available on Netflix, presents a compelling premise and a talented lead in Mila Kunis, but ultimately struggles with a pacing that hinders its overall engagement. While the film hints at a dark past and potential suspense, its narrative unfolds at a languid pace, making it difficult to remain fully invested in the story.\n\nMila Kunis delivers a strong performance as Ani Fanelli, a woman with a seemingly perfect life that masks a traumatic past. Her portrayal is nuanced and carries the weight of her character's hidden struggles. However, even her compelling performance isn't enough to fully elevate a film that often feels stagnant.\n\nThe movie takes its time revealing key details of Ani's past, which, while intended to build suspense, often results in a lack of momentum in the present-day narrative. The parallel storylines, while crucial to understanding Ani's character, don't always blend seamlessly, contributing to the feeling that the story isn't moving forward at a satisfying rate.\n\nWhile the film touches upon important themes of trauma and its lasting impact, the execution sometimes feels heavy-handed, and the emotional resonance is diluted by the slow pacing. The lack of a consistent sense of urgency makes it challenging to remain fully engaged with Ani's journey and the secrets she harbors.\n\nOverall, \"Luckiest Girl Alive\" has the foundation for a gripping psychological drama, and Mila Kunis's performance is a definite highlight. However, its slow pace and lack of consistent engagement prevent it from fully realizing its potential.",

As a film, and having to cut back between the past and present, only allowed for so much depth, but this film did the best it could with the tone it was given. \nIt's very true. And Mila brought forward that truth very well. Loved it, even tho the tone was a bit strange and moments were a bit rushed.",

Visually, it\u2019s really well done, and the way Mike Barker brought Ani\u2019s world to life was impressive. The contrast between her seemingly perfect life and the darker, more haunting parts of her past was captured beautifully.\n\nThat being said, the plot felt a bit too packed for me. It\u2019s like they tried to cram too much into the runtime, which made the storyline feel rushed and kind of hectic at times. Some parts that could have been explored more deeply were glossed over, and it made the pacing feel uneven. It\u2019s almost like they were trying to do too much at once.\n\nI also felt like the movie didn\u2019t always let things sink in properly. Some of the more intense moments felt like they were brushed past too quickly, which took away from the emotional impact. It\u2019s a shame because there are some powerful themes in there that could\u2019ve hit harder if they\u2019d had more room to breathe.\n\nOverall, though, I still enjoyed it. Mila Kunis gave a great performance, and the film does a solid job at keeping you engaged, even if it doesn\u2019t quite stick the landing in terms of pacing or depth.",

    "text": "I felt really lucky when this movie was over\u2026. I appreciate the story and message, however, the delivery from Tiffany the main character was so weak. I felt a lot of frustration and anger waiting for her to do something Besides apologise to her rapists and be so nice and sweet to one of them even picking up something up for him that he dropped on the floor. What the F??? When you have been that brutally attacked, the last thing you are, is that sweet and nice, especially when you have been bottling up all the feelings for over 20 years. Tiffany was able to tell someone at the end of the film to F off, and I found it strange that that was the only five seconds in the movie where she showed some strength and rebellion. Yes, she wrote an article about her experience, but she was just so happy about the whole process. It just didn't connect or seem real. As a victim of sexual abuse, I can tell you that I understand the control that the abuser has and the power, but after Time, all the anger and frustration boils down to striking out, not being sweet and certainly not apologetic.",
