    "text": "The Judge is a riveting drama that features remarkable performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, but its narrative may not quite live up to the expectations of some audiences, who might be yearning for a more complex and engaging crime storyline rather than a more conventional family drama that, although well-executed, feels a bit too common and predictable. Nevertheless, I found the exploration of the family dynamics to be impactful.\n\nGrading: B",

Good story, great acting, great cinematography.  Just a really solid, very interesting and entertaining look at a semi-dysfunctional father son relationship.  Don\u2019t listen to the pinkie up pretentious critics.  Watch this.  You\u2019ll be glad you did.  I don\u2019t even bother looking at the critics scores anymore.  Just leave it to us common folk for some honest appraisals.",

Just because I think it may be cliche and predictable, I know the average is human and is like \u201cwow, good flick.\u201d Robeert Downey is in top 10 on conversalist if that\u2019s a a word, but he kills it and it, I think it\u2019s a flick worth throwing out to fams or couples that haven\u2019t seen it.

For me personally I have the exact same relationship with my father so it was hard to watch. The best thing is just to cut people like that out.  The brother of the main character wasn\u2019t cast correctly either.  They should have had a more leading female in the mix.",

It's an excellent film, excellent acting and filming.\n\nI recommend this film.",

The beginning of this movie, and, actually, a good deal of it is difficult watching\u2014a lot of family conflict. But the acting is superb, especially, by Robert Duval (as always). So, I hung in there. The plot is engaging. And the characters are engaging. Robert Duval was nominated (for the 7th time!) for an Academy Award and should have won it. The screenplay, also, is spectacular, though challenging to the audience. I highly recommend it unless you like feeling comfortable throughout a movie.",
