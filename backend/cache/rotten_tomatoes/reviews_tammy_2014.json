    "text": "Tammy, starring Melissa McCarthy, is a comedic ride that leans heavily on the star power and improvisational talents of its lead. While the film is far from perfect, McCarthy\u2019s performance infuses the story with energy, charm, and irreverent humor that keeps audiences engaged even when the screenplay falters.\n\nThe film\u2019s screenplay is rough and uneven, often relying on broad jokes and predictable setups. Plot points occasionally feel forced, and narrative structure is inconsistent, leaving some scenes meandering or underdeveloped. However, McCarthy\u2019s comedic instincts elevate the material, transforming otherwise ordinary sequences into memorable, laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nMcCarthy brings Tammy to life with a mix of physical comedy, improvisation, and sheer audacity. Her timing and presence make her character both endearing and outrageous, particularly in sequences where she is engaging in reckless antics or petty crime. These moments highlight her ability to command the screen and carry the film despite its structural weaknesses.\n\nThe direction struggles at times to maintain focus, contributing to a sense of uneven pacing. Yet, creative choices in certain sequences\u2014such as chaotic road trip setups and slapstick interactions\u2014allow McCarthy to shine. The director\u2019s willingness to give her room to improvise results in scenes that are genuinely entertaining and showcase the actress\u2019s unique comedic talent.\n\nSupporting elements of the film, including secondary characters and situational setups, often serve as scaffolding for McCarthy\u2019s performance rather than fully realized contributions to the story. While this reinforces her centrality, it also underscores the screenplay\u2019s limitations and the film\u2019s reliance on her star power to keep audiences invested.\n\nUltimately, Tammy is a fun and lively comedy that works primarily because of Melissa McCarthy\u2019s charisma and comedic skills. It may not be a flawless film, and its story and structure leave much to be desired, but for viewers seeking laughs and memorable, over-the-top antics, it delivers an enjoyable, if imperfect, experience.",

    "text": "Melissa tried to save this film, but the directing was just so bad that it was just a pure cringefest. I came so close to turning the movie off multiple times, which NEVER happens for me. A lot of it was just scripts that were improvised with no actual good attempt at a funny interaction. This was listed as a comedy, but 90% of it was cringe or just sad. It didn't really leave you with a happy or fun feeling. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this.",

    "text": "What an ugly unfunny and all around unpleasant movie.  That doesn't deserve an R rating.  And I'll say again, because they say fuck more than once isn't a reason as we don't live in a fairy tale world.  The word is EVERYWHERE!  I love Melissa McCarthy but the character Tammy is just loud, foul mouthed and a horrible person.  She was such a horrible character I was hoping \"Victor Crawley\" would show up to give the movie a happy ending. The big heist that all the posters, trailers and TV spots only focused doesn't happen until the middle of the movie and was all of five minutes.  Because the movie is so unfunny and boring.  There was no other real plot to focus on.  It was an unfunny SNL sketch that they stretched 97 minutes.  There is an arch for her but honestly when there this horribly unlikable for so much of the movie, you stop caring frankly before act 1 ends.",

This is not a movie made in order to be an epic but watch the pains of human nature softened by humour. Deftly actly and light hearted, an easy watching fun family movie (for older kids because there is a fair bit of swearing). People who rate it low have missed the light-hearted point of the movie.",
