Very good cinematography and brought to screen in a admirable fashion. Intelligently written and whole cast succeeds in character, very convincingly.",

Letting a prisoner escape from airport security in a very detailed manner and at the same time bringing just taser in attempt to rescue the kid. Come on! I was furious the whole 2 hours because until the end I could not figure out how she didn't die already from the beginning for how stupid she is.\n\nAll in all. Effects brought the whole story. Everything else was complete trash and waste of time!",

Claire Foy is a solid Lisbeth though, & Sylvia Hoeks is underappreciated.",

I think the movie really fell down with its clipped dialogue that was trying to be a bit too clever for its own good. I'm sure it read well on paper. The acting was pretty stiff too - maybe that was the vibe the director was going for.",

    "text": "The Girl in the Spider Web (GSW) comes as an uninvited guest some 7 years after the David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, adding confusion to the storyline. A real shame considering Fede Alvarez's work in Don't Breathe (2016) and Evil Dead (2013).\n \nGSW uses David Lagercrantz's homonymous work as source material, of which I know little about as I haven't read the books yet.\n \nIn this entry, Lisbeth Salander has to steal a might computerized weapon, highly visioned by a number of Orgs and criminals, while also dealing with her past that seems to want to hunt her to death, quite literally. If you have come from the Hollywood-targeted The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), you will see familiar names, but no familiar faces \u2014 no recurring actors whatsoever.\n \nI assume casting had to work on a budget, and hiring Daniel Craig was off; I wonder why they couldn't bring in Rooney Mara, because she did a way better Lisbeth than Claire Foy. Claire Foy is alright, but she lacks the heart and soul that Rooney put while playing Lisbeth's role.\n \nSpeaking of Daniel Craig, GSW's version of Mikael Blomkvist is too funny to go unnoticed. Actor Sverrir Gudnason gets his share of spotlight as a supporting character for Lisbeth, and I feel he was given the wrong directions. It feels Sverrir is trying to be seductive on all his shots, and that's f** annoying. It is funny to compare both Fincher's and Alvarez's Mikael with the Mikael from the Sweden version, which is far more mundane \u2014 perhaps too mundane.\n \nGSW has a simplistic plot line, a line that is solid, but unexceptional. Remember that I haven't read the books, so I'm dismissing any comparisons. The fact is that this plot falls under good generic, it has all alright elements we expect, but compared to what we've saw on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the plot is far inferior. I feel the main reason is because the former had elements of a thriller, while GSW is more of a crime-action movie with a few stunts and predictable plot twists.\n \nTech elements are absent of commentary, I feel, at least for an amateur like myself. There are some slick shots, some humorous wannabe moments; the scenery is alright, but nothing spectacular. The soundtrack is a-okay. You can go brain-dead watching GSW and you would be fine.\n \nAnd I feel this sums up the experience of watching GSW: brain dead. Do you know when you want to watch something light, shallow, not much thought process to expend, just watch beginning to end, go \"yeah\", and wrap up? That's GSW.",

In this movie, Lisbeth isn't merely a man hating lesbian, she's Tom Cruise protecting the world and she has a smaller team and less resources than Cruise.  Sweden is lucky to have such a fictional character.  8o)",
