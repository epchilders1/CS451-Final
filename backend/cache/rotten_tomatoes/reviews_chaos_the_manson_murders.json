It did show several sides of different theories which I found interesting. It amazed me that Manson was never put back in jail after several parole violations and one of the clinics he used was linked to some CIA and FBI activity.  Overall not a bad watch if you're interested in possible reasons how and why Manson was able to engineer these crimes and how the Government may have been involved in keeping him out of jail.",

I emotes this film greatly. They do a nice job of crime scene investigating and archival footage with Manson, and he really was quite full of himself.",

    "text": "Chaos: The Manson Murders - 6/10. Errol Morris directs this documentary about Charles Manson, his life before becoming the demon of a human that he became, and his cult. Errol Morris is one of the greatest documentarians in history, and his craftsmanship and abilities as a documentarian are on full display here. But, I feel like this felt a little disconnected at times. Also, it felt a bit indulgent in its stylization the events and focus on Manson. Informative, but not amazing in my opinion.",

    "text": "What happened to Errol Morris?\n\nThis so-called documentary doesn't remotely do either the book or its author justice. The book is spellbinding, truly a page-turner. What makes it so is not just the horrible murders and the new information O'Neil unearthed, but also O'Neil's own story as he obsessively pursues leads and becomes consumed by his assignment. O'Neil is forthright about what the information proves and what it merely suggests. He's candid in recognizing that his inferences might cause him to be dismissed by some as a crackpot, which he clearly is not.\n\nThe movie is junk, full of portentous images and music but lacking in suspense or interest. I only hope that O'Neil benefits from it in the form of renewed sales of his book, which deserves a far bigger audience than this flaccid film.",

Errol Morris has clearly lost his fastball, and does such a disservice to the wonderful work Tom O\u2019Neil did to uncover all the connections to MK Ultra, the prosecutors misconduct throughout the trial, and the CIA connections to the Haight Ashbury Project and Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic.\n\nI truly don\u2019t understand what Errol Morris is trying to accomplish with this documentary.",

    "text": "Sorry...no. Please know this documentary left out so much information on Manson's crimes -- such as several other murders the family is suspected of commiting, including one of their own defence lawyers.  Manson used his \"girls\" by prostituting them out, maybe not for money, but to bring men into his group. This was 100% a cult and the leader was Manson. He found an opportunity in San Francisco in the late 60's. He manipulated vulnerable young people who felt lost and wanted to be part of something....during a time where the country was in perpetural angst with the Vietnam war, etc. He exploited it. He got a taste of power and he liked it. When things started to go south, he did what he could to maintain his power. This CIA angle is so flimsy.\n\nIn this doc, most of the courtroom videos show the Manson \"girls\" singing like angels and ignores many of the other insane antics that are documented as happening during the trial. One of these \"girls\" attempted to assasinate a US President a few years later. And last, I don't know much about Vincent Bugliosi. I read a couple of his books and I enjoyed them. But I was really disappointed about how the filmmakers toss him under a bus. Helter Skelter had a lot more pertinent information in it than this doc. And he obviously can't defend himself. It is so disresptful.",

I guess the director was trying to create \u201cchaos\u201d with the way he spliced the footage with double images and reverse colors, and the sound with static. It worked - the film is unwatchable and gave me a headache. Chaos indeed.",

I took issue that any of this madman\u2019s music was considered for use, let alone made it in the final cut. In my opinion, the case isn\u2019t complicated / it was heinous and sadistic.  The whole family were deranged. I do not buy the twist on Manson being a CIA asset or \u201chelped\u201d by anyone that had reason to experiement with mind games .   I do not recommend it.   Let the slain people rest in peace, and don\u2019t spend time waiting for the message behind the \u201creal reasons\u201d for the killings  that never revealed themselves.",

However, the documentary's structure begins to unravel midway, making it harder to follow the story. Some interviews feel scattered, detracting from what could have been a groundbreaking perspective. Despite its ambitions, it struggles to fully deliver on its promises. Visual graphics can be overwhelming at times aswell.",

I wasn't particularly bothered by it, in fact I liked much of it as it was unique in its own way. Overall I enjoyed it very much and thought the CIA/FBI was compelling.",
