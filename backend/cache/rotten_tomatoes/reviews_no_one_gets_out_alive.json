Quando se mistura com o sobrenatural, ai o filme perde um pouco o foco e falta explica\u00e7\u00e3o e motivo pra tudo que acontece. O monstro em si \u00e9 pouco explorado e terminamos nos sentindo bobos achando que o filme seria o m\u00e1ximo.",

In all that I\u2019ve read about \u012atzp\u0101pal\u014dtl, I don\u2019t see anything that depicts her as a monster that eats the heads of her victims with her toothed hooha. Also, a couple of creepy white men preying on undocumented immigrant women. It\u2019s certainly a choice.",

The movie itself is nothing but another mediocre horror: Wasn't bad but with the stronger plot de a few details would ve been better. The \"monster\" was very overwhelming tho...",

    "text": "Poor adaptation of a good novel.\n\nHaving come into this on the back of finishing the novel I was quite excited. However everything about this adaptation is so far removed from the novel I do not understand how they are connected at all. The characters names, settings and back stories are all so far removed from the original source.\n\nIt's a real shame as the book was a fantastic premise to a great horror story. \n\nAs a stand alone horror movie it lacked any real story, little build up. It was very disjointed, things just kind of happened without any real explanation. I didn't find it particularly scary, it was nicely acted and the characters could have been engaging given more thought and effort. Overall very disappointing.",

It wasn't really my cup of tea as a horror fanatic, but to divert the situation into reality, it is scary. not the ritual of the owner but the fact that, you are in such a place, in such a situation, and then you experience such thing.",

    "text": "Starts out as a pretty predictable haunted house story, although the stress and fear of being an undocumented immigrant comes through strong. The last third of the film shifts into the bizarre with allusions to ancient Mexican mythology, a strange and creepy monster (if a little obviously CGI), and a frightening villain. I was rooting for the heroine to kick some butt and wasn\u2019t disappointed, although the suggestion at the end that the heroine might become the villain was a bit unsatisfying, but nonetheless probably less cliche than an escape and a return to normalcy.",

Overall I would say well played. Way better than 60%. There aren't many movies that pull it off after the first 30 minutes of ho hum but this one did succeed. I only write these when I think the film has more value than the ratings.",
