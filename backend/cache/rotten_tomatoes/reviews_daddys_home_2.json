    "text": "BIST DU EHER ERSTER FREUND ODER FRAUENVERSTEHER?\n\nBrad und Dusty sind mittlerweile ein halbwegs eingespieltes Co-Daddy-Team. Doch weil T\u00f6chterchen Megan zwei Weihnachten doof findet, soll\u2019s diesmal ein gro\u00dfes, gemeinsames Fest in einem Skiort geben, inklusive der eigenen V\u00e4ter Don und Kurt. W\u00e4hrend Don jeden umarmt, der nicht schnell genug wegl\u00e4uft, baggert Kurt alles an, was zwei Schenkel besitzt. Das Fest der (Be)Sinnlichkeit kann beginnen.\n\nDaddy\u2019s Home 2 \u2013 Mehr V\u00e4ter, mehr Probleme (2017) l\u00e4uft etwa 100 Minuten und ist ab 6 Jahren freigegeben. Wir haben hier die Fortsetzung der Chaosv\u00e4ter, diesmal herrlich erweitert mit John Lithgow und Mel Gibson.\nIch mochte die Fortsetzung tats\u00e4chlich etwas mehr, vor allem wegen Gibson, der mit sarkastischem Grinsen und grimmiger Coolness genau meinen Humor trifft. Die Schneeballschlacht war pures Comedy Gold und die komplette Krippenszene hat mich laut lachen lassen.\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt\u2019s wieder schwache Gags, Leute tun sich weh, es gibt Fremdsch\u00e4men en masse und alles wirkt noch ein St\u00fcck konstruierter als im ersten Teil, aber es passiert mit so viel Augenzwinkern, dass man\u2019s gut ertr\u00e4gt.\nWeniger gelungen sind die Ehefrauen. Sarah bleibt die Moralbiene vom Dienst und Karen (Dustys Frau) bekommt genau zwei S\u00e4tze. Aber gut, der Film hei\u00dft ja auch nicht Mommys Home.\nDas Finale im Kino ohne Strom ist dann der gro\u00dfe Kitschmoment, hier zeigen alle V\u00e4ter, Stiefv\u00e4ter und Gro\u00dfv\u00e4ter ihre Gef\u00fchle, was charmant gemeint, aber eindeutig eine \u00dcberdosis Zuckerguss ist.\nUnterm Strich bleibt eine Fortsetzung, die dank Gibson noch etwas besser funktioniert als der erste Teil. Leicht, unterhaltsam und v\u00f6llig harmlos, perfektes Familienfutter.\n\n6/10 Punkten. Wenn Kinder in einem Kinofilm mitspielen, kann man die eigenen ruhig mit reinnehmen, auch wenn Liam Neeson mit einer Panzerfaust auf dem Poster ist. Was soll schon passieren?",

    "text": "Daddy\u2019s Home 2 had a tough task following the success of the original. In my opinion, it doesn\u2019t quite reach the same level of freshness or charm, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without value. The sequel still delivers plenty of humorous and fun moments, along with the same kind of corny comedy beats that defined the first film. This time, however, the cast is expanded with the addition of Mel Gibson and John Lithgow, along with some screen time for John Cena.\n\nThe core idea is still intact: a battle of personalities and parenting styles. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg continue their back-and-forth dynamic, but now it\u2019s mirrored on a larger scale with their fathers in the mix. That\u2019s where the sequel really finds its footing\u2014John Lithgow\u2019s character, for example, is one of those \u201cembarrassing parents\u201d you\u2019d dread being related to, yet he\u2019s played with such over-the-top charm that he steals the spotlight in nearly every scene he\u2019s in. Mel Gibson brings a completely different energy, leaning into the gruff, old-school dad role and creating a funny generational clash that works better than expected.\n\nThat said, the film isn\u2019t without flaws. The direction feels a little scattered at times, and the story occasionally stumbles as it tries to juggle too many comedic setups. It doesn\u2019t always hit its mark, and some scenes feel like stutter steps rather than smooth transitions. Still, despite its unevenness, the movie manages to keep the humor flowing enough that you\u2019re never truly pulled out of the experience.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the critical response to this film always baffles me. Sure, it\u2019s not a groundbreaking comedy, and it certainly doesn\u2019t rival the original in terms of novelty. But to call it one of the worst comedies or to treat it like it deserves to be \u201crotten\u201d feels unfair. It may be flawed, but it\u2019s far from terrible.\n\nUltimately, Daddy\u2019s Home 2 is a mixed bag. It\u2019s not a film I\u2019d go back to often, but it has enough genuinely funny moments and enough strong performances from its expanded cast to make it a worthwhile watch, especially if you enjoyed the first one.\n\nVerdict: Not as good as the original, but still a fun, silly, and watchable comedy with a cast that knows how to lean into the ridiculousness.",

    "text": "I think people who rated this movie below 2, are just sad with their lives and live alone. It was an absolutely laugh, these \u2018critics\u2019 must understand that comedies are exaggerated and are not real life and they don't follow real life rule. So when a critics say it\u2019s too dumb, duh it\u2019s a comedy movie it\u2019s not meant to be serious. The acting was brilliant, the story line was decent, it did the job of the movie, \u201chave a division in the family, then resolve it\u201d. It\u2019s unjust to criticise a movie when you do not like the genre. It\u2019s funny how these professional critics hate it, but the general public loves it. CRITICS SHOULD NOT SAY THE MOVIE IS JUST DUMB, it a comedic genus, the way it takes a very big social problem; e.g. blended families and give those people who are effected by it a way to relate and find a way to have a laugh. DO BETTER CRITICS",
