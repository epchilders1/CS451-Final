    "text": "I read this entire book series. More like I devoured this book series. So when I saw there was a movie on Netflix. I turned it on with my little brother at around 11 PM at night, and boom! My night turned sour. All the acting was good. Especially Sophie and Agatha. They were how I imagined them. It felt like someone was given the vague plot of the first 3 books, and made a movie. Why in the name of the School Master did Soman Chainani do a cameo in this! They misunderstand almost every single concept (the ones that put in the movie) in the books. They misunderstand the Trial by Tale, and that\u2019s one of the only things in the book they include. They ignore the biggest mystery of the first 3 books by just name dropping Rafal in the literal beginning of the movie! When in the books it took three, 400 page, full length books to get their names! Then at the end of the movie they dare to propose a second movie. Even the way they represent a 2nd movie is horribly diluted from the book. They imply Tedros is the one who wants Agatha back in the world of fairy tales instead of the opposite! I\u2019m so mad at the direction of this movie the only good thing I can say about it is that I liked the character of Hort in this movie.",

Not 10 because in my opinion they could've went even further with the visual effects because sometimes they felt a bit\n\"cheap\" but maybe that's just me... Soundtrack is very fitting. Loved everything about it but with the bigger budget it would be even better.",

The moral complexity is not overdone and is almost brushed over by the bigger problems, which catered to the entertainment of older viewers.",

I really enjoyed it as something just to watch, it's nice to have on while doing homework, since you can get the gist of the movie without paying too close of attention. Really hoping for a 2nd movie, but will go read the books while I wait! :D",

It\u2019s a story of friendship sticking and holding together through the storm! I was in love with this book series when I was in middle school! When I realized there had been a movie adaptation, I was ecstatic! And though I agree that the movie lacks details and insights from the book, it still was an amazing watch for me! I hope there will be a second movie!",

    "text": "The special effects and acting is the only thing that really makes this worth watching. The characters, despise the actors best efforts, were basic and one sided and had no real character development. The old woman prosthetics for Sophie did not look good in the slightest and they might have well have casted someone else for her scenes. This movie would work just fine as a PG movie but they insisted \"oh it has violence and fighting like a lot of kids movies so let's put swears in and make it PG 13\"",
