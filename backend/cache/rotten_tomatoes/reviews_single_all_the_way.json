The supporting characters and the love triangle trope added to the excitement. Only issue is the acting could\u2019ve been a tad better but the movie was still great!",

Michael Urie and Phileman Chambers offer delightful chemistry with comedic support by Jennifer Coolidge. I'm smitten with this Christmas rom-com --- and possibly a little biased as a gay, former resident of NH that loves to see the representation on screen. Charming, heartwarming, and entirely modern, Single All the Way is a must-watch newcomer to the holiday scene.",

    "text": "If you want a corny Christman movie, this is the film for you. Personally, to me, the problem I have with this film isn't unique to the film itself, but many LGBTQ+ films that depict interracial relationships: so much attention in terms of complexity and nuance is given to a white character than a POC, particularly the black character. The film centers on a white protagonist's need for love and romance. Though I can't change that premise, I do wish there's more attention given to his black \"friend\" in terms of what he wants in a relationship or at least a nuanced discussion of how he felt being that black friend in a predominately white space.",
