    "text": "The problem this movie has is that it's categorized as a \"comedy\".   Audiences in this generation expects non stop comedy and this movie failed to do this.   Idk if comedy and drama would be better so viewers know what to expect.    I really enjoyed the movie because I enjoyed watching how after a parent(s) raises their children what to potentially expect as that child becomes an adult.    I really enjoyed his aspect of the movie.",

    "text": "A lighthearted and fun film that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Robert De Niro is the engine that propels it forward, and has great interplay with Leslie Bibb and Sebastian Maniscalco. The rest of the supporting cast (in somewhat predictable and stereotypical roles) provide fodder for them to bounce off.  While there won\u2019t be much in the plot that will surprise you, there\u2019s real sweetness in the journey.  The laughs come from situational awkwardness and Maniscalco/De Niro interactions.  The father/son dynamics are well written and playfully acted.  De Niro pulls out all the stops in a too-short scene that got me misty, and in a light-hearted romp of a film, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment.  I had about a dozen laughs (above average these days) and left happy.",

    "text": "I loved it. The clue to what it is really about is that the crucial action takes place on the 4th of July. This movie is really about political polarization and the human understanding, compassion and humor that are required to move beyond it. That it ends with a Christmas card picture is a nod to the need for a spiritual revival to grease the wheels of understanding. I loved that such a profound message was couched in so much silliness.",

    "text": "Good Movie, with excellent casts. But roles are a little off making the movie a bit boring. Sorry but in my own opinion, the daughter looked same age as the mom in the movie cant stand it. Also, they could have picked another actor to play the role of Sebastian, he's a good actor, not just a good fit. There are movies that makes you feel connected and interested, not this one.",

    "text": "Robert De Niro is a legend of cinema, known for his transformative performances in intense dramas and gangster films. Seeing him in a comedy is always a curious shift, and this film provides an opportunity to explore his lighter side. While it may not reach the heights of his dramatic work, it offers a charming, quirky, and surprisingly enjoyable experience.\n\nThe story centers on the intersection of two families\u2014one with Sicilian roots and the other more assimilated\u2014whose lives collide under humorous circumstances. The cultural clash, combined with misunderstandings and exaggerated situations, forms the backbone of the film\u2019s comedy. De Niro delivers his performance with the same precision he brings to his more serious roles, grounding the film with a steady presence while allowing the chaos around him to unfold naturally. Supporting characters complement him well, contributing memorable comedic beats and enhancing the dynamics between the families.\n\nThe screenplay, while not without its flaws, is generally effective in balancing humor with character development. Certain scenes lean heavily on exaggerated jokes and slapstick, which can feel overextended at times. However, these moments are offset by clever dialogue, situational humor, and strong chemistry between the cast. The film\u2019s pacing occasionally falters, but the overall narrative arc remains cohesive, carrying the audience through its comedic journey with ease.\n\nVisually, the film is well-executed, with settings that feel authentic and relatable. The attention to detail in both family homes and everyday locations adds depth, supporting the story without overshadowing it. These grounded environments enhance the absurdity of the comedic situations, allowing viewers to invest in the characters while enjoying the humor.\n\nUltimately, this film succeeds as a lighthearted comedy that showcases Robert De Niro\u2019s versatility. It may not redefine the genre or his career, but it delivers enough charm, humor, and memorable moments to entertain. For audiences seeking a fun, engaging film with a strong central performance, this is a worthwhile watch.",

I liked that they tackled the important question of whether a tough or indulgent upbringing is better.  I also loved the portrayal of Ellie's younger brother, Doug.  His \"woo woo\" persona was part of the comedy, but he was treated very kindly by the parents, and Doug's approach was shown as ultimately helpful.",

    "text": "Ok- even if you're a fan of Sebastians, and I am, this is kinda mundane. \nIt's a real interest5ing movie but nothing hear is going to make you do anything more than smirk and it's done in the old sit-com style of teaching a moral lesson. I don't mind that- we don't have any morals now b/c they AREN'T taught anymore. I'm glad I watched it but I'm not gonna keep it for my collection. Still worth a spin though.",

    "text": "Sebastian e o seu pai, um imigrante italiano, s\u00e3o convidados por Ellie, namorada de Sebastian, a passarem o feriado do 4 de julho na casa dos pais dela. Sebastian ir\u00e1 aproveitar a oportunidade para pedir a m\u00e3o de Ellie em casamento, por\u00e9m a alian\u00e7a da sua fam\u00edlia est\u00e1 com seu pai e ele s\u00f3 entregar\u00e1 a ele, ap\u00f3s avaliar Ellie e sua fam\u00edlia. \u00c9 uma com\u00e9dia baseada em choques culturais. De um lado, temos uma fam\u00edlia muito rica, que tenta a todo custo minimizar as tens\u00f5es, para passar uma boa imagem, permitindo tudo a seus filhos para que n\u00e3o passem por adversidades. Do outro lado, temos a fam\u00edlia de Sebastian, que como toda fam\u00edlia de imigrante, teve que passar por uma s\u00e9rie de dificuldades econ\u00f4micas e aprenderam a valorizar o dinheiro, economizando o mais que puder. Al\u00e9m disso, temos o conflito entre Sebastian e o seu pai, movidos pelo que o mundo j\u00e1 mostrou aos dois. Robert De Niro repete aqui pela milion\u00e9sima vez este personagem ranzinza que v\u00e1rias com\u00e9dias o utilizam. O que \u00e9 pouco para algu\u00e9m como ele. Do lado da fam\u00edlia da namorada, Kim Cattrall, como a matriarca da fam\u00edlia, e Leslie Bibb, como Ellen, s\u00e3o os que se destacam. O maior problema desse filme est\u00e1 na dire\u00e7\u00e3o, pois o roteiro at\u00e9 entrega boas piadas e conceitos c\u00f4micos, mas a dire\u00e7\u00e3o leva tudo de maneira desleixada. E sinto que o elenco apenas diz as falas. Apesar disso, h\u00e1 alguns momentos interessantes, como a sequ\u00eancia inicial com um De Niro de rabo de cavalo e a cena onde Sebastian e Salvo est\u00e3o enterrando os restos de um pav\u00e3o morto e Sebastian diz que Salvo est\u00e1 fazendo aquilo como se j\u00e1 estivesse acostumado (claro que \u00e9 uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o com os filmes de m\u00e1fia que De Niro normalmente est\u00e1 relacionado).",

    "text": "I absolutely loved this movie! I went in knowing nothing about it\u2014other than the fact that I\u2019ve always enjoyed Robert De Niro\u2019s films\u2014and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny and heartwarming it turned out to be. At first, I expected a typical storyline, but it quickly stood out with its refreshing kindness and genuinely likable characters. It was exactly the feel-good movie I needed, leaving me smiling from start to finish. I loved every character, so much so that I watched it twice in a row! Now I\u2019m inspired to rewatch The Intern for that same uplifting vibe.",

    "text": "I usually cannot stand the hacky comedy of Sebastian Maniscalco, but was intrigued by this great cast. This isn't the best crafted script, the emotional elements weren't really developed to make it super touching, the humor was safe, and the plot elements moved clunkily along. BUT it was surprisingly warm and entertaining, I really liked that the times the humor could go in an extreme and crude direction it didn't, and was refreshing that they didn't indulge in being offensive for shock laughs. There were some genuine laughs and really good performances. Sebastian was fine enough to convincingly carry this out, he didn't move much from his one dimensional Italian stereotype shtick, but he was surprisingly likeable. Glad this wasn't about the rich people being so entitled they were prejudiced and unlikeable, they were good people, just in an entitled bubble. Overall this is a very likeable, comfortable film.",
