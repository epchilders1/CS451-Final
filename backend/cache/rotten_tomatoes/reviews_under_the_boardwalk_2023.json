The songs were not good and the singing was worse- especially the male protagonist. \nWestside Story (Romeo and Juliet) except with less real characters, more overt messaging and worse music\u2026 and crabs.",

    "text": "A very formulaic movie that goes through all the storybeats in the way you would expect. A pocahontas like story where two lovers meet from different factions. A girl that wants to leave her sheltered live and see the world. A guy that is a little too shy and finds it hard to fit in. It has all been done before and borders the line of cliche.\n\nThe only praise I can give in terms of originality are it's setting. Some effort was put into the world building. And the very musical like structure. Though most songs are pretty standard, and not much to write home about. It does feel like a musical with some production value.",

Only problem was that the storyline felt a like a copy of 2011 gnomeo and juliet. Enemy colonies against eachother, think they killed eachother, go to war other the killing they thought happened. Couple that weren't allowed to date show up and saves each other in-front of everyone.. \nat least this movie had a few changes and fun characters.",
