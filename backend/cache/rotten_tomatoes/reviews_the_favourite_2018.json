    "text": "Abigail played by Emma Stone is characterized very interestingly. It is like you love this character and want to keep seeing her appearance but always subconsciously think something bad will happen to her and she will end up in tragedy. However, although she got bullied quite a few time in beginning, she is not the typical \"beautiful, pitiful, brainless vase;\" you can see the intelligence in her eye, which is shown more and more as the movie progresses later. Her dynamic with her later husband is also interesting: she shows desires and temptation but never fully satisfy the man, keeping him always on the hook. Later in the stories, although Abigail did some quite harmful things and you see it directly, you internally actually do not want to admit that she is bad, causing that conflict in your feeling. \n\nYorgos's film always \"pull in\" all my emotions and feeling: it is not just entertaining but also consuming in a good way as you just cannot stop thinking about the character for a while. For Abigail, it is this internal \"conflict\" that lingered with me. \n\nOverall, this movie is a absolute must-see. But it is not a easy, totally entertaining movie. It is best when your mind is clear and is ready to put in some emotions and feeling into the experience.",

    "text": "A different sort of period film with darkly subversive layers and impeccable comedic acting by Olivia Colman and Emma Stone. Colman's Queen Anne was hilariously brilliant and deliciously irreverent and she centers the film, even as the horrors of her (true story) unfold. Delightful, twisted, beautifully produced, I recommend you watch it.",

It\u2019s a sharp reminder that in politics and ambition, you always have to try \u2014 because someone else certainly will.\n\nI honestly expected Emma Stone\u2019s character to return to the stables in the end, but the film subverts that expectation entirely. Its mix of intrigue, cruelty, and absurd humor gives it a very high rewatchability potential.",

I discovered and fell in love with Olivia Coleman on the spot as she brought to life a Queen Anne that no one ever has nor ever will see again. Brilliantly bonkers satire! (Don\u2019t watch if you think you\u2019ll be getting a BBC style history lesson.)",

Beautifully shot and looks amazing on the big screen with it's fish eye lense shots and the seemingly yellow candlelight during the night scenes. Nevertheless it's also a very rough watch that I probably won't want to watch again.",
