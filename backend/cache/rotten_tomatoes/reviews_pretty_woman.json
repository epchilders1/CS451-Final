    "text": "Pretty Woman (1990) is one of those rare romantic comedies that has truly stood the test of time \u2014 a sparkling blend of humour, heart, and undeniable chemistry. Directed by Garry Marshall, the film is a modern Cinderella story that brings together two unforgettable performances and a message about love, transformation, and self-worth.\n\nJulia Roberts shines as Vivian Ward, a spirited and kind-hearted woman whose charm and honesty light up the screen. Her performance is magnetic \u2014 full of warmth, humour, and humanity \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why it launched her into stardom. She brings depth to a character who could have been a stereotype, instead making Vivian funny, strong, and deeply relatable.\n\nRichard Gere is equally captivating as Edward Lewis, the polished businessman who hires Vivian as a companion for a week \u2014 only to find himself falling for her genuine nature. The chemistry between Gere and Roberts is effortless, giving the film its heart and magic.\n\nThe supporting cast adds flavour and comedy throughout, and Garry Marshall\u2019s direction keeps the tone light while still allowing for real emotional moments. The film\u2019s Los Angeles backdrop sparkles with style and glamour, and the now-iconic soundtrack \u2014 featuring Roy Orbison\u2019s \u201cOh, Pretty Woman\u201d \u2014 perfectly captures the film\u2019s playful, romantic energy.\n\nWhat makes Pretty Woman special is that beneath its glitz and humour, it\u2019s a story about two people helping each other rediscover who they are. It\u2019s about acceptance, growth, and the idea that everyone deserves love and respect \u2014 no matter where they come from.",

    "text": "Pretty tail!\nUplifting cinematic showcase of female empowerment. Any stepfather would hold up as an example to his three boys Vivian's eschewing of controlled substances. Any mother to her three girls would likewise be heartwarmed by Viv's monogamous focus on a stable, high profile trick. Any middle sister would be green with envy over Vivian's enormously good fortune. Any housekeeper would no longer regret her choice not to have children. Ignoring the obviously distasteful reality of Hollywood's faux plot line, this is an enjoyable example of rooting for the plucky underdog.",

I have to say with full honesty that it was better than I was expecting it to be with my childhood memories. Julia is perfect, she is endearing and intoxicating. I don't believe for a minute that she passes as a worker in that profession; but if we found an actress who did the movie might have a different light. \n\nCinderella meets My Fair Lady.",
