The characters are named the same but literally everything is different about them and not in a good way. Great actors horrible characters. Wish they would have stuck to more of the original but we got this unfortunately. If your not a fan or had no idea there was an original Im sure you will like it or your kids will. Just not Little Nemo fans",

    "text": "This movie exceeded my expectations. The story is simple yet deeply touching. There\u2019s something so powerful in its simplicity - the way it blends adventure with raw emotion, making you feel both the excitement of the journey and the weight of her longing. It doesn\u2019t try to overcomplicate things, and that\u2019s exactly what makes it so special.\n\nAnd the effects? Waw! Absolutely stunning. The dreamscapes are mesmerizing, from the moment they sail across surreal oceans to the breathtaking rescue scene. It\u2019s all CGI and green screen, yet it feels so real, so immersive. I won\u2019t name names, but some massive blockbusters with sky-high budgets don\u2019t even come close to this level of craftsmanship. Every detail is fine-tuned - even something as small as the piglet\u2019s tiny hairs shifting when he twitches his ear. That kind of attention to detail is rare, and it shows just how much love and effort went into this film.\n\nHonestly, Slumberland delivers some of the best visual effects I\u2019ve ever seen.",

Is that too much to ask when are boys going to get an imaginative outlet. Also why is lip a big muscular Samoan He's supposed to be a short bald cigar smoking clown. They completely missed any nostalgia",

Jason Momoa, Chris O'Dowd, and Kyle Chandler are wonderful in this story dealing with loss, and finding your inner strength, and holding on to your inner child! Marlow Barkley is delightful and a joy! This movie hits all the right notes and brought us all to tears!",

Plus the chemistry he has with the protagonist here is outstanding. Besides them 2 and the Uncle, no other character really has much depth, but the movie is entertaining enough and it looks great for its budget. Although nothing will really blow you away here, it\u2019s a nice and cozy film you can watch with the kids also.",
