    "text": "Sometimes you know instinctively that a movie is not good in a critical sense, but you feel it working on you in spite of yourself. There's nothing to do but sit back and let it happen. This is one of those occasions. Based on a true story, although a lot of liberties were reportedly taken to make it more family friendly, I found this to be a simple but effective little movie. Schmaltzy? Yes. Cliched? Yes. But effective. And I'm happy to recommend any decent family movie, although I think smaller children might grow bored with many of the scenes not featuring the pooch. Even at a mere 95 minutes, it does feel a bit long, and it could have used a bit more editing. Flashbacks involving Williams-Paisley as a child could have been excised. This is basically a Hallmark version of events - even the direst of moments feel overly sanitized, including a potential bar fight that is unintentionally funny. All that being said, I started preparing myself halfway through the movie for a couple of teardrops to be shed by the end. And I wasn't wrong.",

    "text": "Dog Gone is a somewhat charming but mostly cheesy movie that is about a dog named Gonker that goes missing and the owners go through major lengths to find him. This movie really shines with the cast, which primarily consists of the family members Fielding, who is the dog's owner, played by Johnny Berchtold, the Dad which is played by Rob Lowe, and the mom which is played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley. All three of the actors have this great family dynamic, especially the Dad and Fielding who struggle to get along throughout the movie but as they search for Gonker together, their adventure kind of brings them closer together. And I feel like as the family is searching for the dog and we get to develop these other plots to keep the story going, it kind of feels like the movie sort of loses its identity and tries to be a dog story, and a father/son story. There's also a lot of other factors to the movie where they try to keep you watching but at the end of the day, the story is just mediocre which has to do with the writing mostly. This movie had interesting ideas that might have sounded great on paper but the execution failed for the most part. If you were going into this movie expecting a dog movie, this isn't what you'll get honestly since it does deal with the dog going missing. Overall, Dog Gone has charm and has some great moments between characters that will touch some people but the writing, the story, and the movie in general is mediocre. C+",

    "text": "Dog Gone - 7/10. I love dog oriented films! I'm a sucker for a movie where the dog is a main character. Dog Gone is a \"based on a true story\" film about a young college kid who adopts a dog while at college. Trying to find his way in life, he and the dog go back home after college, as his parents and friends unintentionally pressure him to figure out what to do in life. Though initially not wanting to have the dog in the home, the parents warm up to the idea as the dog brings joy and all with its presence. After an incident where they find out the dog has an auto immune disease that needs to be treated with medicine once a month, the dog gets lost one day, and the dad and son must go find it in a race against time before the medicine wears out. Its a simple film, not an amazing one, but it captures some things really nicely. Its definitely one of the better Netflix productions in recent times, and it is a good family friendly watch. An okay film with an adorable dog as one of the leads!",

However, the story is, at its core, inspiring, showing the lengths people will go to under  certain circumstances, which ultimately saves this movie from being truly awful.",

    "text": "The movie tried so hard to make the dog so quirky and different from other dogs. The part where they rushed the dog into the vets with a bloody stretcher has me dead, the dogs not eating or playing it wasnt seizing on the floor and no way any respectable vet clinic would pull out a stretcher assuming the worst case scenario before preforming a health check. The only good part of the movie was Oji! the dog is like any other dog and his humans are just too narcissistic to see otherwise, if one more line saying \"hes not any ordinary dog\" or anything along the lines of that i would of died. The movies good for a hate watch and you will have a good laugh at how unbelievably stupid it is!",
