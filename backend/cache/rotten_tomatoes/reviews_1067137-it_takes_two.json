It is a fun and silly family movie that is very good for what it is. Not every movie has to be some profound think-piece. Sometimes it\u2019s ok to have a little fun. I think the critics that review movies like this poorly must have terribly sad lives because it seems they\u2019ve lost the ability to enjoy some old-fashioned whimsey.",

Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg play great parts, and the lines that Philip Bosco gets are the best in the movie.",
