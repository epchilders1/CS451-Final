I love the colorful, vibrant animation that brings Dr. Seuss\u2019s whimsical world to life. I love the original songs and likeable characters. It\u2019s fun watch for families and all Dr. Seuss fans!",

    "text": "A very watered-down adaptation that replaces the original, complex and important concept about the perils of groupthink and even fascism with the type of generic and message that can be found in just about any children's media you care to choose. A wasted opportunity in an age where the original message is more relevant to our children than ever before.",
