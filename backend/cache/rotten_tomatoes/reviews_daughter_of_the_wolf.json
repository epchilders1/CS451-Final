Acting wasn't bad, as some comments say, but it wasn't mainstream either. I think it showed some realness that many populair movies don't have.\nOverall a good watch and I was quite invested in the characters.",

A mother fighting to get her son back and will stop at nothing to complete the job! Use your own judgment but I\u2019m glad I watched it!",

I cared so little I quit watching 10 minutes into it which was a generous waste of my time.  I love how the main character wears false eyelashes to her son's drop off/exchange.",

Quite sure when she ran the rednecks off the road she was in a different vehicle from the one she arrived in. She did something truly amazing, picking up two shotgun cartridges off the floor of the vehicle she was driving, this was such fantasy making a scene like this. I would rather watch paint dry than watch a movie like this, all I could suffer was about 5.20 minutes.",

Mas oque ele n\u00e3o conhece \u00e9 a m\u00e3e que e Gina, e ira buscar seu filho mesmo que seja no inferno. E vai matando um a um. Mesmo sendo lan\u00e7ada de um penhasco. Um filme onde Gina n\u00e3o mostra todo seu potencial de Fight, uma pena. Mas oque ela mais tem \u00e9 um santo forte, pois tudo ocorre para que alcance seu objetivo.\nRoteiro: mentiroso\nVale apena assistir? Se n\u00e3o tiver outra op\u00e7\u00e3o. \nNota: 4",
