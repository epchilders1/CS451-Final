    "text": "I absolutely recommend this movie, although it will (should) make you angry. We don't typically get to see the full story of how racial friction leads to tragedy, but that is what this film lays bare. It's frustrating and infuriating to watch this older woman rage against her neighbors for simply playing football and roller skating and being kids around her house - but people like her do exist, unfortunately.\n\nThe way the film was edited was incredible, considering that most of the video came from bodycam footage. Watching the police do what they can to help the situation within the limits of the law was interesting, and of course disappointing when they couldn't take greater action to discourage the \"perfect neighbor\" from her ridiculous behavior. What a miserable person! But it was worth watching to have a better understanding of how some community relationships develop and deteriorate around us.",

There was no need for a 1 million Dollar budget when I could\u2019ve filmed that on my phone. Horrible movie waste of time don\u2019t watch it.",

Now as a documentary I think the use of solely raw footages is great and the whole story is heartbreaking and harder to get through than most movie, however I'm just not sure about whether we should be exposed to such raw and personnal footages and if it's a good idea to label such content as movie as this should only be something to be used in a courtroom or for a studying purposes",

    "text": "This documentary was formed to strengthen the prosecution, then during the settled aftermath it\u2019s become an invitational conversation as we observe with intimate access over the compelling craft, as well demonstrative over the procedural system. The vocal forum will no doubt be divisive in further questioning the case that suggests inquired thoroughness, whether if decidedly acts as the devil\u2019s advocate or just biased without much thought. Maybe acted on insisted gimmickry and questions are answered afterwards beyond the lens, but the consensus overwhelms the defendant\u2019s problematically layered mentality. Educationally raw over the societal prospects whilst provocatively engaging and agreeably unsettling like any dark impacts that ripples into a documentary\u2019s conceptualization in spreading the story just as it was witnessed. This true crime documentary\u2019s complex case edges this as one of this year\u2019s best to the format, a deserving contender to be ranked among the best. (B+)",
