I have seen rusty nails and bricks with better acting skills, more charisma, and likeability than these actors. Asinine plot, storyline, and script. The dumbest dialogue ever. Even the action scenes are boring. Overall, this is an unbelievable, unconvincing, unrealistic, and stupid movie from start till finish.",

Ent\u00e3o ele decide fazer uma competi\u00e7\u00e3o com condenados a morte que est\u00e3o pelos pres\u00eddios do mundo e trazer para sua ilha e fazer eles se confrotarem uns com os outros e quem vencer ter\u00e1 sua liberdade. Enquanto todos os participantes s\u00e3o assassinos, traficantes, guerrilheiro,.... Tem um bom rapaz que entro por ultimo, substituindo um participante. E quem \u00e9? Steve Austin, um ex-fuzileiro e bom mo\u00e7o que estava preso injustamente. E assim come\u00e7a a competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Acontecem atrocidades, estupro, trai\u00e7\u00e3o,....... E vai assim morrendo um atr\u00e1s do outro. At\u00e9 que no fim Austin se liberta e vai atr\u00e1s do grande vil\u00e3o. Existem v\u00e1rias vers\u00f5es deste estilo de filme, e este n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos melhores. Mediano para fraco. E existe cenas fortes de crueldade, que n\u00e3o seria necess\u00e1rio.\nRoteiro e enredo fracos.\nVale apena assistir? N\u00e3o\nNota: 3",

    "text": "Honestly, this is one of my all-time favorite action flicks.  Particularly for a low-budget film.  Acting throughout is solid, albeit a little lackluster at times, but I think they really nailed the premise here which is what I liked most about The Condemned.  This isn't a mindless action film, it's got depth to it and almost acts as a fictional social experiment; making an unrealistic storyline come to life by highlighting just how terrible humanity can be. It perfectly depicts the depravity of society tuning in, in droves to pay to witness live murder, torture and rape.  The emotional rollercoaster is also captured brilliantly.  First, it seems like you've tuned in to watch a real-life Battle Royale, but as it gets darker, you see the characters (namely Hoffman and Musset) start to question their own involvement and morality.  Hoffman's performance was a stand out for me in that regard.  I strongly believe this is almost exactly how this would play out in a real life scenario.  The excuse of: \"Well, they're going to die anyway and they're murderers, so who cares what they go through\" is precisely how society would react in my opinion and Wiper captures that beautifully.  Robert Hammone encapsulates greed and selfishness to a tee and it worked as stark reminder that people are willing to sell anything, with no regard for human life, if it lines their pockets.  Most of the action scenes are tons of fun to watch, even though some of the dialogue is a little cringe at times.  Austin plays his role perfectly and bounced off Jones - who is as sadistic as they come - exceptionally well.  While the storyline is predictable, I was okay with the \"happy ending\" in this one and I highly recommend giving it a watch if you're into OTT action movies.",

    "text": "I liked it very much. Refreshing, and I would go so far to say not politically correct (which obviously is a good thing) there is an honest depiction of what would happen if you had to fight for the death plus there's juicy scenes where a female is fondled. Although I would like to see a movie go further and have unwanted s e x with a female because that is real life as people keep saying. Unfortunately the female wins against her abuser which is predictable, I would like to see the guy have his fun with the female and then go on to win it, because being PC doesn't help a good script. I despise perfunctory accountability on the guys perspective i.e. the female kills him because he tried to \"get inside her panties\" etc. All in all good film with good action from Stone Cold Steve Austin. Have a beer or three and enjoy! Have a good day X:)",

    "text": "'The Condemned' simply isn't a great film, due to its subpar acting, mostly predictable plot and average other aspects like the cinematography. However, I can't deny it still makes for solid action viewing. Just to be enjoyed for what it is.\n\nWith that said, it actually does have an interesting concept - one that is kinda fascinating. The film commits to it fairly well, hitting many correct notes in regards to the morality of the matters at hand. I also didn't think it would take such a dark-ish tone with it all.\n\nSteve Austin is decent in the main role, he is no Dwayne Johnson or even John Cena but he has the right look for a beefed up protagonist. Vinnie Jones is Vinnie Jones in this, he's exactly how you'd expect him to be. The rest of the cast are largely forgettable, though Madeleine West actually gives the film's best performance as Sarah - despite only appearing in a minor part, I felt her character's feelings. It's also cool to see Rick Hoffman in a role pre-'Suits'.\n\nIf you just want pure action with loads of fighting, this is one for you. The second act and the last remnants of the ending drag, but it's largely a fun watch if you don't take it too seriously.",

Had the very typical \"hero American\" who was morally and physically superior to everyone else just to stroke the ego of Americans. Expected from an American film company though.
