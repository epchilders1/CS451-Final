    "text": "Murray plays a middle aged curmudgeon for the umpteenth time, the kid is wise beyond his years and the movie is a mix of the sentimental and unlikely. Maybe the most surprising thing about the movie is Naomi Watts playing against type and getting most of the laughs. Unfortunately the final act wallows in the sentimental and cliche. Pretty average.",

I stopped where I thought there may be something to watch my general impression is this movie though means well tries to hard and \nforces too much on the audience. A simpler script may have made for a great movie\nremove the bookie and the girl friend and just focus on the boy mom and murray\nleave out the priest too. Cheers",

    "text": "A good example of poor rhetoric in movie form. It hides self-contradictions beneath emotional music and silly sentimentality, a slight-of-hand attempt at hiding its flaws from the audience. It fails at this as well.\nMurray's accent is entertaining but his character is unsympathetic. Sainthood denied.",
