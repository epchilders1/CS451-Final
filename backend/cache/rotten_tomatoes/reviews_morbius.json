Not saying this is one of the best comic book movie ever but it was really good.  It's very rewatchable IMHO.   I give it a 4.5/5 \ud83d\udc4d",

Jared Leto performance deserves an oscar. All the scenes in the movie where Morbius morbed all those guys was not actually CGI but was real since Jared Leto is that talented!\n\n-Written by my friend.",

    "text": "Morbius is a movie I knew would not be very good but I thought it could possibly live in the realm of so-bad-its-good which are the Taco Bell of films and have their place. Unfortunately, Morbius is, more than anything, boring. \n\nI tried coming into this film with a fresh mentality \u2014 I wanted to view this as a standalone vampire movie, one disconnected from Sony\u2019s interesting choice to have a Spider-man adjacent universe without Spider-Man in it. What I found here was visually uninteresting, terribly written with phoned in performances from everyone except Matt Smith who seems to have accepted his fate here and decided to make the best of it. The design for Morbius is fine at best and resembles melted plastic at worst. The story is held together by vague nonsense meant to service the introduction of our main man Morbius and the villain who, predictably, has the same powers. Watching it back, a prominent flaw here is the film has committed itself to nothing, if you make it a noir horror that could have been interesting, if it leaned more into being a genuine vampire flick that could have worked too \u2014 anything would have been better than the half hearted end result we are left with. And the cherry on top of this film, which has to be mentioned, the advertising constantly alluded to the fact that this was connected to Tom Hollands Spider-Man, Tobey\u2019s Spider-Man and Venom but the movie ends up being connected to absolutely nothing! Again, while I do not think it HAD to be connected to be worth watching, the fact that it knew it would ultimately connect to nothing but promoted itself as such to trick fans into coming to watch it almost makes me feel like I should take legal action against the film itself. \n\nI believe films that miss the mark often have enough to talk about as films that hit the bullseye. Not here. It commits a lot of sins as a film but the ultimate sin was being completely boring and forgettable. With no standout moments, subpar performances, lackluster visuals and a paper thin story, Morbius is one of the worst films of 2022 to no one\u2019s surprise.",

    "text": "Morbius was released in theatres in 2022 and stars Jared Leto in the lead role, Matt Smith as Milo, and Jared Harris as Emil Nikols. Morbius and Milo have the same rare blood disorder that has largely crippled them and left both men physically weak and almost unable to walk. But Morbius is apparently rich and a genius so starts experimenting with vampire bat blood to cure himself. The cure works but turns him into a vampire; shocking. Milo sees Morbius all better and wants the cure too but Morbius refuses. But Milo really wants to be a vampire so he steals the virus and starts draining people of blood. Morbius discovers what Milo has done and a big CGI battle takes place with a lot of vampire bats and Milo is defeated. I remember reading this comic as a kid and I liked it. It was dark, gory, and had a good horror element to it. Unfortunately Morbius went for a PG-13 rating which killed all of that and made the movie kind of dull. Jared Leto was ok but the movie dragged, the CGI was bad, and I just didn't care about the characters. Skip this an go watch the first or second Blade movies again for some good vampire superhero action.",

    "text": "Morbius is a near-complete failure as a superhero film. The acting is weak, with Jared Leto and others often delivering unconvincing performances. The plot is predictable and poorly paced, with underdeveloped characters and a romance subplot that is forced, forgettable, and unnecessary. CGI and visual effects are inconsistent, often looking like low-quality video game graphics. The villain is underexplored, and major plot points \u2014 including the ending and credits scene \u2014 are rushed and unsatisfying. Overall, the movie fails to deliver excitement, emotional weight, or coherent storytelling.",
