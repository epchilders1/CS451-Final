The 2 main characters are well developed, including and especially their relationship with each other and to their family. Most of the really horrible stuff these people are fleeing from is only touched on, with more focus on the positive - but still, you get a clear sense of what people are up against when forced to abandon their homes and generally not welcomed in the rest of the world.",

    "text": "The Netflix teaser showed a scene that doesn't happen until two thirds of the way into the movie. That didn't make those two thirds any less harrowing. The characters half a world away both geographically and culturally are so human and relatable, I felt genuine dread, horror, and heartache for them. The titular Swimmers are real life Syrian sisters - 17 year old Yusra (Nathalie Issa), a driven and ambitious Olympic hopeful, and Sarah (Manal Issa), who is few years older and more interested in partying. They have a younger sister. And a pet bird. When the war starts, they try to carry on. There is a symbolic scene in which the sisters are dancing at a rooftop club. To Titanium. Rockets are falling in the distance. The loud music drowns out the sound of explosions, literally and figuratively. But the war catches up to them. The swimming complex gets hit. People they know are dying. Or going to Europe. The parents make an agonizing decision to let the girls go. With two conditions - they get their male cousin to go with them and they take a land route. The cousin comes, but the land route is quickly dismissed as impractical. \n\nThere are a lot of artsy shots in the film. But the most powerful ones are simple. Lifejackets sold everywhere at the place in Istanbul \"where the Syrians meet\". People quickly counting their borrowed money and handing it to the smugglers, who disappear with no guarantee that they will come back. The promised \"boat\" carried down to the shore - small and folded. The patches on it. And the sun sinking into the sea as the motor is dead, there's water in the boat and no land in sight. \n\nThe girls' journey could have easily looked like reenactment of various news stories from that time. But somehow the filmmakers managed to make it so much more. I felt like I was there, with those people, every step of the way. Unfortunately, that is lost in the last part of the film, after the scene that was in the teaser, and the movie becomes flat and kind of forced. \n\nI don't want to say that it's an important film, but it is. And I am glad it's most important part is as well made as it is.",

    "text": "Powerful, inspirational, and undoubtedly an eye-opener, The Swimmers deserves all the buzz it generated at last year's award season and more. Director Sally El Hosaini captures the strife of the immigrant experience through a poignant story about two sisters in this biopic that goes straight to the heart with its outstanding performances, beautiful cinematography, and well-written script. Every moment felt real, which made it effortless to resonate with the characters and feel their emotions. It's not easy to describe how watching this movie made me feel, but it definitely put things into perspective and left me speechless in awe and passion.",

    "text": "A tremendous Road-Trip style movie that follows two daring sisters from Syria and their courage and bravery through thick and thin in being able to get to Geenany to pursue their joint dream of competing in the Olympics in Brazil. There are parts that lag a bit that could have been more tightly edited for the benefit of continuity speed, but generally speaking its a tip-notch film that us both inspiring and endearing. At the end of the day people are just people, we all want a better life, more options, choices and opportunities, so its a film everybody can relate to, on s very human level. Highly recommended, and its worth viewing twice or more with some time between each viewing. \ud83e\udd13",
