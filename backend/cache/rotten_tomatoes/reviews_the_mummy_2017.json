    "text": "Another reboot,  remake,  reimaging of a tale we've seen hundreds of times.  Tom's ego driven character is on full view as usual,  let's be honest hes Tom in everything.  Some really good and vfx and cool idea's,  the undead looks great and the crows are quite different however the complete over the top settings of set pieces gets tiring fast,  the plane sequence is just Micheal Bay fever dream fuel.  Its a watch and forget for me ! Its not the worst film and was originally planned as a springboard for a dark cinema franchise of films , including wolfman, dracula and frankenstien however this flopped hard . Watch it ,and just know Brandon's films was much much better.  Its alright at best.",

    "text": "The Mummy (2017) is one of those rare blockbusters that manages to implode under the weight of its own ambition. Starring Tom Cruise, the film was meant to launch Universal\u2019s \u201cDark Universe,\u201d an interconnected world of classic movie monsters reimagined for modern audiences. Instead, it served as a cautionary tale of how not to reboot a beloved franchise. What was once an exciting concept about ancient evil resurrected in the modern world becomes a jumbled, incoherent spectacle that forgets what made The Mummy franchise fun to begin with.\n\nThe biggest problem here is tone. This movie can\u2019t decide what it wants to be. At times it tries to channel the adventurous spirit and humor that made the Brendan Fraser films so beloved, but those moments are immediately swallowed up by grim attempts at world-building and overblown action sequences that feel ripped straight out of Mission: Impossible. The result is a movie that feels like it\u2019s constantly at war with itself\u2014half supernatural horror, half blockbuster espionage thriller. None of it fits together.\n\nTom Cruise, normally one of the most reliable action stars in Hollywood, feels completely miscast. His character lacks charm or direction, and it\u2019s hard to tell whether we\u2019re supposed to root for him or not. He\u2019s too smug to be likable, too selfish to be heroic, and too inconsistent to be compelling. What\u2019s even more distracting is how much of the movie feels built around Cruise himself. Every scene feels tailored to showcase him rather than the story, and that ego-driven focus drains the film of any real character depth or horror atmosphere.\n\nThe screenplay doesn\u2019t help matters. It\u2019s chaotic, unfocused, and full of ideas that never go anywhere. The plot jumps from ancient Egypt to modern-day London with no sense of rhythm or purpose, throwing in mythology, curses, secret organizations, and forced romance all at once. By the time the movie tries to introduce Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll\u2014a clumsy attempt to tease future spin-offs\u2014it\u2019s already clear that the \u201cDark Universe\u201d was dead on arrival. The dialogue feels rushed, the pacing is exhausting, and the story itself is buried beneath endless exposition.\n\nDirector Alex Kurtzman, better known for producing than directing, struggles to maintain any kind of consistent vision. The movie is full of big, loud moments\u2014planes crashing, sandstorms, and supernatural fights\u2014but none of them leave a lasting impression. The horror elements are watered down, the adventure aspects lack charm, and the few attempts at humor fall completely flat. It\u2019s a technically polished film that feels completely soulless.\n\nAt its core, The Mummy should have been a thrilling blend of mystery, horror, and adventure. Instead, it\u2019s an overstuffed attempt at creating a cinematic universe before earning the right to do so. It sacrifices story and character for setup and spectacle. Even with its massive budget and star power, it never recaptures the magic that made audiences fall in love with the franchise in the first place.\n\nIn the end, The Mummy (2017) is a perfect example of Hollywood\u2019s tendency to chase trends rather than tell good stories. It had the resources, the cast, and the potential to reboot a classic in spectacular fashion\u2014but instead, it became a lifeless, overproduced mess. It tried to be everything at once and ended up being nothing at all.",

I fastforward all the action, explosions and rubish content trying to stop on content. There were none. The only thing I took out of this movie was its breef mention to British Crossrail archaeology in the introduction credits. I google it and that was much more interesting! Recomend a google search to London's Crossrail findings.",

The mummy is actually really creepy and funny at the same time.  Is it better than the Brendan Fraser movies? I think it is in my opinion \ud83e\udd14 but those movies have their good entertainment value as well.  I would give this movie an 87/100 for what it is.",
