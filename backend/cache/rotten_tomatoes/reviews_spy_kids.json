    "text": "The original Spy Kids holds a place near and dear to my heart. With its absolutely unhinged designs in the Fooglies to the bizarre Thumb Thumbs \u2014 and its mix of James Bond and Codename: Kids Next Door-style gadgets, it was one of my favorite movies to watch and rewatch until the VCR got hot.\n\nI completely understand if someone says they don\u2019t like this movie. It\u2019s very much a product of its time. But if you were a kid \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, most of us at some point wanted to be a spy \u2014 it hits a sweet spot. I won\u2019t pretend it\u2019s perfect, but what it does well, it does really well. It has that distinct Robert Rodriguez tone: chaotic, colorful, and confident. The story is silly and often predictable, but never boring. I mean, the main scientist villain is literally named Minion. Not a nickname \u2014 his actual, God-given name is Minion. It\u2019s little details like that which make this movie so memorable and weirdly charming. The gadgets are creative, the action is frenetic and fun, and the world feels like it was designed with a 10-year-old\u2019s imagination \u2014 in the best way.\nOf course, it\u2019s called Spy Kids, so the leads are children. They\u2019re decent, and even when their line delivery isn\u2019t perfect, it somehow adds to the charm. It makes them feel more like real kids thrown into an impossible spy mission \u2014 which helps sell the story even more.\n\nIf you\u2019re diving into Robert Rodriguez\u2019s earlier work, this probably isn\u2019t the first film I\u2019d recommend. But if you\u2019ve got kids \u2014 or just want to watch something totally wacky and whimsical that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 this is a great pick. Just\u2026 do yourself a favor and avoid the sequels.",

    "text": "A whacky creation of Miramax.\n\nCarmi & Juni are your typical siblings really having rivalry & not wanting to help out with each other, until their parents get kidnapped.\n\nI believed that Juni could be a messed up child when he watches Mr Floops TV show with his characters behind him who are scary looking (the mutants & the thumb thumbs). It is like they are cartoons being converted into live action (like Lenny Henry's \"The Right Trousers). Occasionally, the person behind scary looking are really evil, Mr Floop was too & created realistic android children to take the brain he needed. Soon, he turns good in the end learning that Cortezes & others stay together as a team.\n\nLovely how 2 siblings must cooperate as their parents jobs to save their parents.",

    "text": "*\"Spy Kids\"* is a whirlwind of colorful chaos that\u2019s exactly what you'd expect from a family-friendly adventure. The young cast delivers stellar performances, selling the absurdity with gusto. The story is imaginative, fitting for a film aimed at younger audiences, though the CGI has not aged gracefully\u2014what looked cutting-edge in 2001 now feels charmingly retro. Alan Cumming steals the show as the flamboyant, eccentric villain, providing memorable moments with his over-the-top antics. While the film revels in its ridiculousness, it\u2019s all part of its charm, making it a suitable choice for a family movie night. The absurdity and fun are enough to make it a nostalgic trip down memory lane, even if it doesn't quite hold up as well as its stars might like. Overall, it\u2019s a decent watch for a good dose of family-friendly escapism.",

    "text": "My biggest question is \"why all the love from critics?\" Yet, the movie fell short of a passing grade with audiences.\n\nMy theory is the feeling of movie-goers pre 9/11 was much more in tune with the film. Watch it after 9/11, which is when a lot of people came along  to do their own critiques, and Spy Kids, like Americans, lost their innocence.\n\nI watched it before 9/11 and don't remember disliking it. I didn't dislike it this time, but it missed the mark for me -- and, evidently, tens of thousands of other movie-watchers.",

    "text": "Muy buena pel\u00edcula, una muy buena cinta de esp\u00edas para toda la familia. Esta es una cinta con una trama algo simple que no se toma mucho en serio y tiene algunas conveniencias para que la trama avance de forma correcta, sin embargo tiene una esencia muy \u00fanica con la que te logra meter a este mundo de esp\u00edas tan fant\u00e1stico. Ambos protagonistas son geniales y tienen una gran qu\u00edmica, sin duda que son irreemplazables estos personajes. A ellos se les suman los dem\u00e1s miembros de la familia los cuales son todos muy memorables debido a la gran calidad de los actores. Por otro lado, el villano me parece genial y todo el entorno en el que esta es visualmente muy bueno. Sin embargo, la calidad de los efectos especiales no es la mejor, viniendo de Robert Rodriguez se sabe que sus pel\u00edculas no tienen mucho presupuesto y no tienen los mejores efectos, pero tampoco me parecen escandalosos como en la tercera cinta. Las actuaciones son muy buenas, principalmente las de Daryl Sabara, Alexa PenaVega, Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Danny Trejo y Alan Cumming. Por ultimo, destacar el soundtrack el cual se me hace ic\u00f3nico a mi parecer. En conclusi\u00f3n, una cinta genial para ver en familia, con una historia entretenida en todo momento con personajes memorables. La recomiendo.",
