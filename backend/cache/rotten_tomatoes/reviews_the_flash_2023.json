    "text": "I really like this movie. In fact I enjoyed it more than Quantumania. While then and right now I havent done a more or less proper DCEU binge, I loved this movie. The writing was great and the story was good. The acting was amazing as well. While the movie couldve indulged in more multiverse elements during one part, the movie was great nonetheless. I understand that it was controversies that caused the movie to flop, with the possibility of a lie on someones end concerning actor likeness being used without permission, but this film was great. Shouldve released before beetle and lost kingdom, but a great film. I hope in the following years that it becomes an underrated gem akin to the Incredible Hulk (which I have t seen yet). While the ending couldve done more of a final farewell type thing with the credits emphasizing that the DCEU was over, the film was still good. And I hope that one day people will realize its underrated.",

If Ezra Miller hadn\u2019t F\u2019d up his personal life and was able to do the talk show circuit, this movie would have been well received. I didn\u2019t like the killing off of Supergirl and would have loved to see how the movie would have ended if her stand alone Supergirl movie got released instead of shelved. I would still like to see it. The ending with George Clooney was great though. Left room for a sequel.  People take this stuff too seriously, it\u2019s a comic book movie, not Casablanca.  It was enjoyable. I really liked it!",

Cause they didn\u2019t want to spend money on this idea\u201dcause of james gunns vision\u201d to finish it properly but the story is great.  It\u2019s just a shame. Ezra got so much press for being a nut. But again, who in Hollywood isn\u2019t",

I am kind of disappointed that we won't see more of Ezra Miller in this role.  It suited him well and expanded his character from Justice League in all the right ways in my opinion.  (spoiler) it was cool to see iterations of Superman in Christopher Reeve and Nicolas Cage as well as bringing back the original big screen Batman! Kara Zor-El was also super cute!",

    "text": "Not the worst project DC has ever produced, however The Flash has far too many unexplained plot holes. When you have a story based on time travel, there\u2019s far too many details to get entangled by because there\u2019s no rules to anchor the storyline. The plot is just messy and the CG is unacceptable. The film was still fun to watch. Having said that, I\u2019m hungry.",
