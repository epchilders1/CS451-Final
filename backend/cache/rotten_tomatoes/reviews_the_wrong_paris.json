    "text": "This was actually a pretty entertaining film both lead actors had chemistry Miranda Cosgrove getting to shine away from her Disney days. While Pierson Fode also looks like he could be the next Gosling or Chris Hemsworth.\nThe premise is basically one  of those dating reality shows where girls go through hoops to impress the guy or vice versa and they get whittled down to the one.\nNow Cosgrove's character thinks this show is taking place Paris, France so she applies to the show as a means to get there but the producers trick all the contestants as the show will take place in Paris, Texas - USA.\nThe catch is that the two leads met briefly outside the show and flirted and they actually do like each other despite Cosgrove's insistence she doesn't like Fode. \nSo will they end up happily ever after? Will she get to France. Well what do you think?\nIt's a solid film entertaining andis actually one of Netflix's better romantic comedies.\nIf you're after a feel good film, this could be it.",

    "text": "I thought this was a really cute movie. It's based off of The Bachelor, but still! It's about a small town country girl who wants to explore more of the world and also get more into her passion: art. She gets accepted into art school in Paris, France but she doesn't have the money to go. So her sister convinces her to go on a reality dating show because there is money to win there. So she goes for the money and also because the dating show is supposed to be in Paris, France so she can get to France and stay there. However, they fly her out to Paris, Texas instead which is near where she lives. The bachelor is a guy who she met briefly at a bar and they connected but didn't exchange contact info. The two end up falling in love, and she tries to tell him about her art school plans but she gets interrupted by the show members. Then another girl shows the bachelor the art school acceptance letter. The girl gets kicked off the show but she does get enough money to go to France. A producer tells her that she can crash the finale if she wants to explain herself to the bachelor but that she would have to forfeit her winnings, even though she really needs the money. She crashes the finale but the guy doesn't seem phased. She says that she thought they could figure out their future together. She says bye to him after he rejects her but leaves a piece of her artwork. He then learns that she forfeited her winnings and ask the producers to give it back because she needs it for school. He runs after her, decides to let her win the quarter million dollars and they agree that they would share it. They also agree to figure out their future together, as school is only 2 years and he could stay in Paris, France with her or fly back and forth to visit her. \n\nSo cute!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this movie\u2019s premise, but the moment they landed in the wrong Paris, everything turned into a cheap comedy mess. Every actor looked like they were in a different movie zero chemistry. The romance plot is so clich\u00e9 you can predict the ending from the first glance they share. Don\u2019t watch this if you\u2019re hoping for something refreshing or thought-provoking. This one\u2019s a horror show.",

Durign the good moments the story is great and is quite funny making me laugh quite a bit.  this was dampened by several bad moments also that uust didnt make sense and were total cringe making me wonder what the writers were thinking to include such an aweful scene.  Still if you can get past the bad moments the good moments are worth the watch.  With more good than bad this movie is worth watching.",

    "text": "The Wrong Paris, in my opinion is a movie worthy of 2 stars. The beginning and the ending of this movie are the best parts of this movie. Other than that, every scene is either stupid, corny, or absurd. Of course, there are certain scenes in the movie that are fine and make sense, but other than those, the rest of the scenes could make someone gag. If you like Miss Congeniality and Mean Girls, this movie is for you, but if you like movies with concentrated storylines, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for you.",

    "text": "It\u2019s a film that, for all its faults, does have an interesting modern premise: what if we made a film about a terrible reality dating television show? Unfortunately that was the only interesting thing going for it. \n\nMiranda Cosgrove somehow finds herself in this self indulgent rom com adjacent mess of a film with AI scripted one liners and cliche plot point after cliche plot point. The film does, to its credit, make me smile an embarrassing smile for how horribly and accurately written its cast of fame seeking, self aggrandizing influencers \u2014 only knowing this from unfortunately indulging in many brain rotting Netflix produced realty shows myself. The plot however, is so groan inducing and copy and paste than any I have seen in a while. The two main love interests are initially uninterested, become more interested over a series of time, coincidentally find they have more in common and choose each other over whatever item/job/money was threatening to keep them apart. It\u2019s a formula that can work but this film doesn\u2019t do anything to impart anything special to that formula outside of the setting which doesn\u2019t do enough to differentiate. Forgoing the more engaging and believable ups and downs of a romance in favor of a fast incline and a quickly solved 3rd act conflict. \n\nOverall I think this was just a lazy boring attempt to continue this trend of lazy modernized rom coms with no heart or interesting story to tell. Conversely telling the most cookie cutter story inclusive of real life influencers, I\u2019m looking at you Harry, a \u2018unique\u2019 hook and a big enough name to package it all together. You\u2019re better off watching sleepless in Seattle for the 105th time, folks.",
