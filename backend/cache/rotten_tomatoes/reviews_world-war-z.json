This is as generic a Zombie film can be with mindless action, little to no gore with a PG-13 rating and Brad Pitt as the star marketing to the most popular audience they can you can tell this is a trouble production but those sequences of carnage are sometimes entertaining",

I appreciate the whole \u201cWhat if we made zombies act like ants?\u201d but the virus had more depth than any of the characters. Still enjoyed the ride.",

The pacing was perfect, keeping me guessing what would happen next. Plus, the special effects were absolutely insane; the gore was fantastic. The makeup and the way they did the zombies were truly remarkable. They really went all out on the details. Overall, it's one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, and I highly recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "World War Z was released in theatres in 2013 and is very loosely based on the novel of the same name written by Max Brooks. While the book was a series of short stories about the zombie outbreak that nearly destroyed the world, the movie centers around Brad Pitt's character and his attempts to keep his family on a boat. Pitt plays Gerry Lane who is an ex UN investigator caught in the initial zombie outbreak in Philly along with his family. In exchange for keeping his family on a UN boat he agrees to track down the initial outbreak location and travels to several countries. While doing so a zombie gets aboard his plane so naturally he detonates a grenade mid flight and blows up the aircraft. However his plot armor holds up and walks from the crash site to another UN base. He soon learns that zombies have sick people radar and can detect illnesses for some reason, which they avoid. Pitt therefore decides to infect healthy people so they don't get bit and end up infected by the zombies; yes this is the actual plot. In short while I really enjoyed the book this travesty was supposedly based on, this movie was terrible. I like Brad Pitt but the plot here was just dumb, the SFX were terrible, and the ending was a war crime. My only hope is that they don't make a sequel.",
