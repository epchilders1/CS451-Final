They don\u2019t make comedy\u2019s like this anymore. Love this film. Roll a blunt and watch with your boys, it won\u2019t disappoint.",

    "text": "The Hangover Part III serves as a harsh reminder that sometimes a story is best left unfinished. After the runaway success of the first film and the lukewarm reception of its sequel, the third entry in Todd Phillips\u2019 comedy trilogy feels like a desperate attempt to squeeze one last laugh out of a concept that had already run its course. What made the original Hangover so fresh \u2014 its wild unpredictability and insane chemistry among the cast \u2014 is completely gone here, replaced with a hollow sense of obligation and a plot that feels more like an afterthought than a conclusion.\n\nThis time around, the Wolfpack \u2014 Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) \u2014 find themselves roped into a new adventure involving Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and a crime boss played by John Goodman. On paper, that setup might sound like a fun change of pace. In practice, it strips away the core element that made these films special: the wild morning-after mystery. Instead of waking up to chaos and piecing together the night, we\u2019re given a straightforward kidnapping caper that lacks both the energy and the heart that made the first Hangover a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe addition of John Goodman could have been a major win \u2014 he brings gravitas and comic timing to almost any role \u2014 but even he can\u2019t save this aimless script. The humor feels forced, the pacing sluggish, and the chemistry that once carried the series now feels tired. The cast does what they can, especially Galifianakis, who still manages to squeeze a few genuine laughs out of Alan\u2019s childlike absurdity, but even his charm feels overused by this point. Cooper and Helms coast through their roles like they\u2019re just trying to get to the finish line, and it shows.\n\nDoug (Justin Bartha), as always, remains irrelevant \u2014 the franchise\u2019s most forgettable main character. His absence once again drives the plot, but by now it\u2019s almost comical how little he contributes to the story. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why they didn\u2019t just cut him entirely or turn the running gag into an intentional bit of meta-humor. Instead, the film continues to treat him like an anchor that never mattered in the first place.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is how little the film even tries to be funny. Gone are the outrageous set pieces and comedic shock moments that defined the first two movies. Instead, The Hangover Part III leans into action-thriller territory, trading laughter for chase scenes and forced sentimentality. It\u2019s as if the filmmakers forgot what kind of movie they were making, hoping that an edgier tone would somehow reinvigorate the franchise. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it just makes the whole thing feel misplaced and joyless.\n\nBy the end, the trilogy limps to a close with a half-hearted sense of finality. There\u2019s an attempt to wrap things up emotionally, but it\u2019s too little, too late. The creative spark that once made The Hangover such a wild ride has been completely drained. This third installment is neither funny nor exciting \u2014 it\u2019s just there, existing because the studio wanted one more paycheck out of a beloved idea.\n\nIn the end, The Hangover Part III is a misfire from every angle. It\u2019s not unwatchable, but it\u2019s joyless, repetitive, and devoid of the humor that once made these characters so much fun. What began as a brilliant comedy classic has ended as a reminder that not every hit needs a trilogy. It\u2019s the weakest and most forgettable entry in the series \u2014 a film that proves sometimes the best sequel is no sequel at all.",

The plot of this movie is outright ridiculous, and at times not funny. Some of the comedy still hits, but this movie should not have been made. There is no reason to tarnish a good duel series like this for more money.",
