Any worse it would become more entertaining. A movie that will lead you mildly saddened but also excited to understand the quality vs entertainment curve more thoroughly.",

    "text": "The film falters with a simplistic plot that feels undercooked and predictable. Characters beyond Driver, like Ariana Greenblatt, are thinly drawn, lacking emotional weight. Pacing issues disrupt the momentum, and it leans too much on well-worn tropes without enough innovation. Still, Driver\u2019s star power and the dino chaos make it an entertaining, if flawed, ride for fans of sci-fi action.",

I found myself not caring about the characters in the story both little girls were annoying and not easy on the eyes.  Dinosaurs were \u201cwaxy\u201d or CGI.. I never liked driver from the Star Wars films so I couldn\u2019t find protagonist in him in this one either.",

Perhaps if there was more character development, or better action/tension scenes this movie could have been better.",

    "text": "The reviews are misguided.   Take the movie for what it is, a thriller that is intentionally short on dialogue and high on suspense.   Enjoy it for the heart pounding jump-scare moments and Adam Driver\u2019s performance trying to communicate with his characters 10 year old co-star when they don\u2019t speak the same language.   \nSometimes simple is a great way to tell a story. \nSometimes miss the critic misses the mark. \n\nWell worth the time to enjoy this prehistoric thriller.",

    "text": "65 was released in theatres and stars Adam Driver as Mills and Ariana Greenblatt as Koa. The movie is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away where Mills goes off on a three hour tour as a space ship pilot. During the trip his ship gets hits by asteroids and crashes on prehistoric Earth filled with prehistoric creatures. To escape the planet he and Kora must travel to an escape pod that crashed on top of a mountain or something. Along the way they get attacked by dinosaurs and such and sort of bond. After reaching the escape pod they get attacked by some T-Rexes but manage to kill them and another beastie to board the ship and leave Earth. 65 had a very After Earth meets Jurassic Park 3 vibe but thankfully was better. The SFX for 65 were not that good, 1993's Jurassic Park dinosaurs were better. Also, the plot was awful, there was no character development or arcs, and much of the movie was dull. Both main characters speaking a different language and being unable to understand each other really slowed the pacing as well. For me it was a subpar sci-fi movie that I didn't enjoy the first time I saw it and won't watch again.",

For the first 20 minutes it seemed pretty good, however, it went downhill very fast.\nAfter 15-20 minutes it had basically zero conversations, no story or anything. The dinosaurs were inacurate or made up, mostly just close ups and could have been replaced by any generic alien monsters anyways...\nI was hoping for a sci-fi story where we could enjoy the world of dinosaurs and in the end it just didnt deliver on anything.\nRespect to the actors though, they made the best out of it.",

Not one to make long reviews. Not enough dinosaurs. Not enough action. Not a good story. But lots of injuries. Non-stop injuries. Great movie about injuries. My review in 4 words. This movie is terrible.",
