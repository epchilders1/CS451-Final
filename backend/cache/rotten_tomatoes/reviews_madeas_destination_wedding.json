    "text": "I have been watch Tyler Perry movies since I was a little girl. From Diary of a Mad Black Woman to Madea Boo. This movie feels like a step down from those. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, everything is just terrible. Feels like everyone was high during filming. The movie seemed so rushed. As an advent Madea fan I was so excited for this movie to come out and was filled with so much disappointment when I watched it. I even watched it a second time and it hurts even more than watching it for the first time. I kid you not a they filmed a part on a iPhone and added it in there. If someone were to want to torture me, just make me watch this movie on repeat. I gave it one star because it was funny. I hope future movies are 100x better than this one.",

The plot was a little messy but the point was about not judging before you know more. The cinematography was better. The actors should continue practicing the craft of acting. And Madea should continue to be a gangsta grannie that can give good advice when it counts.",

The acting and quality was horrible, it honestly gave Tubi movie. As well as alot of the script didn\u2019t match up with the scenes. SPOILER: if she knew his mom wouldn\u2019t she have known he wasn\u2019t cheating ? I think Tyler Perry should focus on different movies, or building actors.",

In the new movie she hasn't remembered anything it's hard to believe she would still be acting this way. I like the holiday aspect but it felt rushed and the ending didn't make sense. The fiance character was horrible he had some half ass lackluster moment of expression to brian but that didn't make up for his blandness. Didn't seem like a good guy.",

This one is just one big commercial for the Atlantis resort with the end not making you to want to go there because of all the extras you have to pay. The plot was thin, the premise unbelievable and even Tyler Perry as Brian did not seem to believe his own script. As Madea he was weak, relying on all the same old jokes that did not work here. Don't watch this movie. I expect more and better from Tyler Perry.",

Not only that, I had to pause the movie sometimes because there were too many moments of overlapping chatter. That started to give me a headache. I\u2019ve only seen the film once and have no plan on watching it again anytime soon.",
