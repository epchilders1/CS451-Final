    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Lo mejor que se puede decir de esta pel\u00edcula es que sorprende. Arranca con un tono de comedia gamberra, pero pronto se transforma en una mezcla de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, s\u00e1tira social y thriller conspirativo que no se parece demasiado a nada reciente. Esa originalidad, en un panorama saturado de f\u00f3rmulas repetidas, ya es un punto a favor.\n\nEl tr\u00edo protagonista \u2014John Boyega, Jamie Foxx y Teyonah Parris\u2014 es la clave del \u00e9xito. Su qu\u00edmica hace que cualquier escena funcione, incluso cuando el guion se enreda o se alarga m\u00e1s de lo necesario. Boyega aporta solidez, Foxx roba planos con su desparpajo habitual y Parris equilibra la balanza con carisma y frescura.\n\nVisualmente, la pel\u00edcula juega con un estilo retro que homenajea al blaxploitation, pero con un acabado moderno y muy cuidado. Esa est\u00e9tica, unida a di\u00e1logos r\u00e1pidos e ingeniosos, le da un aire \u00fanico que atrapa desde el principio.\n\nNo todo funciona igual de bien: algunos giros se sienten forzados y el metraje podr\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s ajustado. Aun as\u00ed, la energ\u00eda del reparto y la mezcla de g\u00e9neros mantienen el inter\u00e9s y logran que el experimento salga adelante.\n\nEn definitiva, El clon de Tyrone es una propuesta distinta, divertida y con m\u00e1s fondo del que parece a simple vista. Una muestra de que todav\u00eda se pueden hacer pel\u00edculas originales dentro del cine comercial.\n\n(ENGLISH) The best thing you can say about this film is that it surprises. It starts out with a mischievous comedic tone but quickly turns into a mix of science fiction, social satire, and conspiracy thriller that doesn\u2019t resemble much else released lately. That originality, in a landscape full of recycled formulas, is already a major strength.\n\nThe leading trio\u2014John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris\u2014are the key to its success. Their chemistry makes every scene work, even when the script gets tangled or runs a bit too long. Boyega brings solidity, Foxx steals scenes with his trademark flair, and Parris balances everything with charisma and freshness.\n\nVisually, the film plays with a retro style that pays homage to blaxploitation, but with a modern, polished finish. That aesthetic, combined with fast, witty dialogue, gives it a unique atmosphere that pulls you in from the start.\n\nNot everything works equally well: some twists feel forced, and the runtime could have been tighter. Still, the energy of the cast and the blend of genres keep things engaging and make the experiment worthwhile.\n\nIn the end, They Cloned Tyrone is a distinct, entertaining project with more substance than it first appears. Proof that original films can still thrive within commercial cinema.",

    "text": "Honestly the movie should\u2019ve had a more subtle title, I think the early big reveal would\u2019ve been a lot more impactful if the audience didn\u2019t see it coming.\n\nAs for the movie itself, it was a really fun, well-written, well-made movie that does some really unique things. The whole cast really shines here and it\u2019s such an interesting premise. John Boyega gives an especially incredible performance as Fontaine.\n\nThe only complaints I really have with the movie are:\n1. The graininess, which was a clear stylistic choice, but made some of the darker scenes in the movie difficult to see\n2. The movie has such an interesting premise that I wish they had done a little more with the whole \u201cclones\u201d thing. There were a few opportunities to use that to do some really interesting things, but it feels like they held back.",

    "text": "A hilarious and sharp-witted satire that brilliantly blends so many genres together, from 70\u2019s blacksploitation to sci-fi to noir mystery with some excellent commentary on racial stereotypes and the systematic conditioning trying their best to reinforce these stereotypes and keep the disenfranchised locked in their corner. John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris are all fantastic and share great chemistry with each other. The movie starts a bit slow, but it pays off when they start playing with Tyrone\u2019s daily routines after the cloning reveal. The movie had me in stitches at some points, and there\u2019s plenty of solid commentary and sharp writing to back up the goofier aspects of the film. The worldbuilding and lore of this movie\u2019s version of the American government and their clone experiment communities is very intriguing and really makes you feel like there\u2019s a whole crazy world to explore. The art direction and cinematography are very solid as well. This is easily one of the most underrated films of the year and is my kind of post-modern intellectual shitpost.",
