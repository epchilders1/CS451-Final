Boring, tried way too hard to stretch out a 5 min bit into 90minutes of watching in real time why Bert needs to stay off the screen. His comedy chops is as valid as Brendan schaubs blackbelt lol",

    "text": "I thought I would hate this. Bert is definitely full of himself and took his only joke worth noting and made an hour and a half film about it. But the movie itself isn\u2019t the worst thing I\u2019ve seen. It did make me chuckle a few times. The fact his actual wife was in it, as his enemy at the beginning was kind of funny. Unless you're familiar with Bert\u2019s comedy or podcast there is definitely going to be some questions. 2.5/5 is about what it deserves.",

It\u2019s not an Oscar movie, not even a good movie, but lots of silly laughs and jokes. I\u2019m glad I gave it another chance.",

It was just a so-so movie in my opinion. maybe I should have given it a 4 instead of a 5. Kind of a toss-up. It was pretty predictable as far as plot goes and there were a few holes in the story, but overall passable.",

I think it was a smart way since Bert hasn't acted to do it this way so you can have a flash back and go back and forth. The throat punch was extremely disturbing lol but funny",
