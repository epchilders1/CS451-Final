Joining forces with a Benadict Arnold in a completely stupid, non realistic adventure escaping the U.S. military and numerous mobs of zombies. Terrible, repetitive, disgraceful movie just plain stupid.",

    "text": "A decent zombie film that ultimately falls short due to weak storytelling. Unlike the first installment, this sequel struggles with character development. It fails to build a compelling dynamic among the protagonists or tie their arcs to a larger thematic idea, which was one of the strengths of the original. The film actually hints at potential with one character having a promising internal struggle that could have grounded the story emotionally, but he\u2019s pushed aside in favor of following another group in basic \"survival mode.\"\n\nAs a result, we\u2019re expected to care about characters simply because we spend time with them, not because the film meaningfully defines who they are or what makes them worth rooting for. When they make big decisions, the motivations feel thin. On top of that, the plot relies on contrivances and coincidences that strain believability and exist mostly to keep the story moving.\n\nTonally, the movie is relentlessly bleak. It lacks the spark, hope, or emotional core that gave the first film its resonance. The descent from bad to worse feels more punishing than purposeful.\n\nWhat does work are the technical elements: cinematography, sound design, score, editing, makeup, and special effects all elevate the tension and atmosphere. The horror elements are stronger and more frightening than in the original, and the larger-scale action sequences add entertainment value.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a film that excels technically but falters narratively. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it on its own merits, but if someone wants to watch the full series, it\u2019s not weak enough to skip.",

    "text": "The sequel to 28 Days Later takes place just over six months after the events of the original, following the efforts of United States-led NATO forces to reestablish a safe zone in London. However, when two young siblings break protocol to retrieve a photograph of their mother, they inadvertently trigger the reintroduction of the rage virus into the supposedly secure area.\n\nIt is a gripping and tense follow-up that, while not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, still captures the bleak intensity and core ideas of the original. The film delivers plenty of thrilling action sequences and a well-constructed escape that keeps viewers engaged, even if the ending makes it all feel somewhat futile. However, the story leans too heavily on the reckless actions of the children, whose poor decisions drive most of the chaos. Some plot choices also feel questionable\u2014particularly the implausible absence of security in key moments and the father, Don, conveniently showing up wherever the kids are. Despite its flaws, 28 Weeks Later remains an entertaining and visually striking apocalyptic thriller that effectively sustains the franchise\u2019s haunting atmosphere.",

There are a few plot holes-ish like the zombie entering the supposed safe quarantine zone but honestly didn\u2019t think too much of it when watching the movie because it was all so gripping. If you haven\u2019t watched any of the films and feel maybe the original is slightly too old deffo recommend. Excited now to see 28 years later and also makes me want to check out the original.",

Rather predictable, the film does a mediocre job establishing and fostering the deep relationships between its characters, leaving the spotlight for only a select few. The supporting characters could have had more depth, something that differentiates the first from the second.",
