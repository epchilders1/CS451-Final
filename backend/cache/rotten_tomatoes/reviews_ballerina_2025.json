Ana de Armas played the role really good and I guess most fight seems are believable for her size.\n\nA joint movie with both characters is a must.",

Dumb storyline, wildly un-compelling characters\u2026 Ana de Armas lacks any trace of bad-assery and is a wildly unconvincing action hero\u2026 Not even Keanu could make this a full one star. How could so many great actors make such a bad movie \ud83d\ude05 A disservice to the John Wick franchise.",

I won't go into details because it's better if you see the movie without knowing the details of it, but it's worth watching. I am buying this movie asap. There's not a lot of movies that makes sense, but this one does. I didn't particularly like the ending, but I guess they had to end the movie that way to leave the door open for a sequel. They outdid themselves in this movie.",
