    "text": "Going into 13 Hours, I wasn\u2019t expecting more than a run-of-the-mill war/action movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised and ended up really enjoying this film.\nWhat really helps this movie stand out is its core group of protagonists. They\u2019re lively, entertaining, and you genuinely want to see them make it through the ordeal. Michael Bay knows how to shoot action scenes\u2014he always has, even during his Transformers days\u2014and he really gets a chance to shine here.\nThe film may lose points for those who care about historical accuracy. Personally, that kind of thing doesn\u2019t bother me, but I understand it could be a dealbreaker for some viewers. I also recognize that action movies aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. If you're not into this genre, 13 Hours probably won\u2019t change your mind. But if you enjoy action films, you\u2019ll absolutely love this one.",

    "text": "VERY fast full of action movie and fun direction by M. Bay, once again. Even when at many moments we get lost between places and characters (I guess it blends in with the topic that everybody is lost and confused even within the movie).\nOn the other hand, the drama was a bit exaggerated and watching Krasinski trying to cry felt like watching Tropic Thunder. Also, the whole ''why are we far from home fighting again in a battle that's not ours'' catharsis, was simply answered with ''money'' in their case (They make it clear at the beginning with the whole jobs back home not paying enough).\nAll in all, nothing unpredictable but good entertainment for more than 2 hours.",

It's very possible to make a movie that's exiting and thrilling and still accurate and patriotic.  This is not such a movie. It's just cliche and typical Bay.",

The characters are pretty cliche, classic army brotherhood style, it's not an innacurate depiction or too over the top but not very original either. All in all it's a solid 7.5/10 and definitely worth a watch.",
