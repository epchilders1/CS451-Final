She captures the essence of the character and has a decent script to work with. The rest of the cast does a very good job too. Worth a watch.",

    "text": "I was able to tolerate 37 minutes. There is a convincing description of a middle aged woman who behaves like an irresponsible teenager. She is a mother as a result of having a uterus and not about showing any interest to protect and raise a child. Her basic objective is to get money, not by holding a job, so she can afford to drink. It looks like occasional prostitution could be part of the plan, but I am not interested to find out. Essentially she has a psychopathic personality. She steals from her own son and his roommate because right and wrong for her is based on what makes her feel good. According to Wikipedia, later on she reforms, which most psychiatrists would consider highly unlikely. I have watched many depressing movies, but this exceeds my tolerance.",

That said, although it's difficult to watch in places, it's an excellent story and screenplay with Andrea Riseborough knocking it outta the park and onto the roof across the street with a very seriously difficult performance that probably took a toll on her pulling it off. And Nancy Janes slightly understated performance is top notch (it's easy to see why she's managed to win and Academy Award. Those looking for something real and well done, TO LESLIE will fill the bill.",
