So:  I LOVED THIS FLICK, a little heavy on the testosterone but I was ready for that:  the film grabbed my attention and didn't let go.  Lotsa dead guys and some blood if that turns ya off, but WHATTA PLOT >> that NEVER QUIT.",

    "text": "The film's idea of revenge, forgiveness, and how far you have to go to get revenge is well developed (okay). For a film where I wasn't expecting anything more than just an action flick, I thought this development was good, and The Rock's gruff style suited the role well. The twist is predictable, but okay. The hired killer could have been better developed and had a better motivation. The direction of the action could also be much better, but I think it's at least acceptable. But overall, the film doesn't aim for anything too grandiose, and what it does aim for, I think it manages to satisfy. I'm surprised by the negative reviews. There are much worse films with higher ratings than this one. Anyway, for me, it's a 7.8 \ud83c\udf45\u00f7",

The plot looks very much like the kind you would find in 40s 50s 60s noir movies, very dense and dark. Acting is 1st class, with Billy Bob, the Rock and Carla perfectly fitting their characters. Photography is beautiful etc etc Lots to say about many things in this film Loved the Chevelle, spot on!",

Just a numbskull movie really as it's pretty much just a numbskull movie really as it just uses violence to salvage itself from any real plot depth and its ridiculously stupid and pointless sub plot about a the hit man who is after him getting married to some random woman or something.",
