    "text": "Just a continued look into victim blaming, and why victims are terrified to come forward. That for some reason when it comes to SA, victims are lying regardless of evidence, and the perpetrators are innocent even if they're guilty. It also showcases the intimidation, abuse, and continued violations SA victims are subject to when they seek justice. It is infuriating, and this documentary very clearly demonstrates that.\n\n I was a SANE nurse for 6 years, and also a survivor myself. These instances shown in this documentary is the reason why I became a SANE nurse, so the survivor would always have an advocate.",

There will be times your heart will break and you'll be angry, but this is an important documentary to watch if you have a daughter,  a sister or any friend who is female. The police work (or lack thereof) is sickening. This doc needs to be seen! Final Score: 8.3/10",

    "text": "This was pretty riveting. It's about women who were sexually assaulted and then charged with the crime of false reporting when the authorities basically turned on them for one reason or another - they were accusing powerful men in the community, the cops wanted to get their violent crime statistics down so they manufactured a non-violent crime to prosecute instead, etc. The fact that the police can lie to you when they interview you - and this is enshrined in the law and a daily part of policing - they call it \"ruses\" - but if you lie to the police you are committing a serious crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law - this is the hypocrisy that is at the heart of this depressing and very well-made documentary. None of the women in this film were lying, and their stories are all backed up by evidence, but when the police employ dishonesty in their investigations, it leads to terrible injustices.",
