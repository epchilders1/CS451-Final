    "text": "The ex-British Special Forces officer turn professional Transporter, Frank Martin has relocated from France to Miami, Florida, and he has taken on what just maybe his toughest job ever... driving wealthy 6 year old Jack Billings to and from his elementary school.\n     Well this was supposed to be just another job, a simple favor to a friend. Then Frank unexpectedly becomes close to Jack and very protective of him.\n   \"Look at me. I promise I'll never let anyone hurt you a lot\" - Frank\n     But when Jack is kidnapped on Frank's watch, he becomes the suspect. Now on the run from the law and chasing after these kidnappers, Frank discovers this is more than what it seems, and their real plan is to release a deadly virus, a virus that only they have the antidote.  \n     I like this second Transporter movie. The villains are a bit over the top, but I expect that from Luc Besson, Its a \"French Thing\" But Jason Startham is totally awesome as the super cool and stylish Transporter...... And just like Frank's his new tricked-out Audi A8 car, this movie is just a fun action-packed ride. \n   Cast -  Jason Statham, Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and,   Alessandro Gassmann, Amber Valletta, Kate Nauta, Matthew Modine, Jason Flemyng",

    "text": "Over 15 years old this manages to be a way more fun installment of the franchise. Frank Martin the infamous Transporter is back. This time he drives around for a wealthy divorced couple with a son. But he\u2019s about to be part of a drug cartel scheme who plans to infect all the politicians controlling the various governments in charge. The son is kidnapped and Frank must not only save him but bring down the people whom are the source of the deadly bio weapon. A fast pace, slicker action scenes, and kickass fights make this a step up from the original. I\u2019m glad that first movie made enough money in dvd sales and brought Jason Statham back. This one had better action despite all the green screen effects and the shorter running time. Yes there\u2019s a lot of stupidity throughout but it delivers on the high-octane thrills giving Statham a more balanced edge. True it might be forgettable but if it\u2019s dumb thrills you want from this character then director Louis Leterrier does just that.",

    "text": "I liked the first one, but this one challenged me. Realism is always tested with these sorts of films, but this sequel went way too far with impossible car flips, a plane crash that didn't kill everyone onboard and bullet dodging which made no sense at all. Fight scenes where all the bad guys conveniently run out of ammo is just lazy writing",

Check. Shallow, cliched bond between the hero and a kid, whose mum either drools over the hero or shows her maternal instincts? Check. Ridiculous dialogues, mediocre CGI and absolutely impossible, preposterous action? Check. The stunts were really good though.",
