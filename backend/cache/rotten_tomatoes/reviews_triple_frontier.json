Cast was amazing (though Pedro Pascal\u2019s character was superfluous), plot setup was fantastic, it was on track to be an excellent film. But it just wasn\u2019t. It felt like everything was going right and then everything went wrong in five minutes and then the movie ended. It seemed as though the director wanted to go deeper than just a regular action movie and landed flat on his face. I finished the movie and was disappointed, no longing for more, not even caring what happened after. Don\u2019t waste your time",

    "text": "Unlikeable cardboard characters decide to do something completely selfish and despicable. Severe consequences follow. Because the characters have no redeeming social value, I didn't care whether they lived or died. So I turned the movie off. I can't believe that some experienced professional on this project didn't raise a red flag and point out what a god awful idea this movie was. Then again, there were apparently creative differences that caused some people to quit, so maybe they didn't have the mojo to convince the right people. If you like explosions and action, regardless of the setup, you might like this, but if you need to get invested in characters in order to enjoy a movie, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "The movie begins with good character building, establishing each protagonist's personality and background, and quickly drawing you into the plot. This part of the film is done quite well for the most part and does a good job at keeping you intrigued. Sadly, that doesn't last. A particular scene comes to mind where there's noone keeping cover while loot is being put into bags; and it beggars belief that trained, seasoned ex-military would get that careless even in front of a huge tempting mound of cash. During all of this, an armed antagonist doesn't seem to want to do anything about the banging and shouting going on in his house, but then decides to come out of a panic room only when there's at least Affleck, Hunnam and Isaac right outside its door, obviously looking for him.",

    "text": "\"Triple Frontier\" follows a team of five ex-military men on a heist to steal the ill-gotten gains of a South American drug lord known as Lorea. The men reluctantly agree, but soon find themselves in over their heads. Throughout the film there are recurring themes of greed, as the men must decide how much money to leave behind to assure their survival. This feels a bit ironic. Here this is a story about risk and reward, where the movie itself takes very few risks and just delvers a pretty straight forward action film.\n\nThe movie isn't bad. It is well cast, has a couple of good twists and plays an interesting game of morality. The characters are nothing memorable and none of the scenes stand out as that impressive.\n\nAs long as Netflix is burning money, they might as well keep recording it for us to enjoy.",
