    "text": "I hardly find movie adaptations to hold a candle to the original book, and while I still believe the book tells the best version of this story, this film is outstanding in its own right! \n\nWhile I feel Rotten Tomatoes to be a bit of a joke as far as genuine criticism goes (one of the \u2018critic reviews\u2019 gave this a low score due to \"too much prosthetics\") it still makes me sad to see only a 65% score for this film. Had this film come out today, I think it had done much better at the box office. One of its pitfalls was having such an outrageous budget, and I think they could have saved some money in some areas and had still done an amazing job.\n\nThe story itself is so compelling, how the overlapping of each others lives becomes more and more prominent as the film progresses. Clearly it\u2019s difficult for some to watch a film with simultaneous stories such as Cloud Atlas, but personally I am drawn to movies that give us such unique storytelling. While each story is shown in short snippets, I still found myself engaged and immersed in each one not only because they were interesting, but because each story slowly intersect with one another as they unfold, and I found that to be so exciting.\n\nDefinitely a new favorite movie of mine, and I encourage anyone who has avoided watching it due to negativity or poor box office performance to give it a watch, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised!",

While those who read the book will likely better grasp the depth of the stories and how the souls journey across time, interacting and affecting each other\u2019s futures, the film is no less extraordinary. Less episodic than the book, thought provoking, visually compelling, a remarkable cast, triumphant musical score, and beautifully woven storylines, the movie is an ambitious achievement that delivers in the best ways, and remains unmatched in scope and storytelling.",

    "text": "When talking about movies that have different interconnected stories, I always find it useful to isolate each story and ask myself if it would be a good story if presented by itself. If the answer is no, then it\u2019s not a good movie no matter how clever or ambitious the interconnected gimmick is. Individually, the Cloud Atlas stories are emotionally inert and too scattered for the audience to get invested in anyone. I\u2019m not opposed to films that try to make you think, but the vehicle for that should be good stories and interesting characters. If the film doesn\u2019t have them, then it just becomes a boring intellectual exercise that treats its characters like props to serve as mouthpieces for some big point the author is making. Skip Cloud Atlas and watch 2001: a Space Odyssey instead.",

    "text": "My favourite movie I've ever watched! To be fair, it isn't going to be for everyone. It's long, and it requires your full attention for the entire runtime. If you're scrolling through social media/texting/etc. you're going to miss many key points.\n\nIf you can put the phone down, there should be something in it for everyone. It's often fast-paced, bouncing between 6 different stories in 6 different timelines that are all interconnected so beautifully. \n\nThere's a mix of many genres with sci-fi, murder mystery thriller, comedy, period piece, romance, etc. Most main actors play at least 4 different characters who are reborn in the different timelines. The acting is brilliant, and it's so amazing to see the work the makeup and costume teams did. \n\nI've watched the movie at least 10 times and love it more with every watch. Don't let the lukewarm reviews dissuade you, it deserves a chance!",

It's long, but the 50 odd characters played by only a handful of actors alone, is worth the time. I found it highly satisfying.",

    "text": "The Wachowskis have something great about them, and then always found a way to fall short (expect for the first Matrix of course). Cloud Atlas is a challenging book to turn into a movie, so some credits are due. Visually it lacks some credibility at times, and feels like a different casting would have worked much better. Definitely watch the movie.",

    "text": "I found this film on a list of box office bombs, believe it or not. I instantly chose to watch it when I read that most critics gave it poor reviews because it was considered too-far reaching to be understood properly. I wondered to myself why in the world we would ever, as human beings, be content with calling something \"too far-reaching\" or \"too intelligent\" instead of seeking to expand our minds\u2014 only to have the movie turn out to be a story about that very concept. So long as we remain in ignorance, we will remain enveloped in hate. So long as we are unable to agree and disagree without being labeled \"one of them,\" we will never be united. The totalitarian regime known as Unanimity in this film combine the words \"unity\" and \"anonymity,\" to create their name, meaning that they believe that the only chance we have at peace is through total sameness. The rebels disagree. This was an absolutely beautiful work of art that instantly slid into my top three movies of all time.",

    "text": "After a third watch my feelings finally cement on this film being ambitious yet middling. I love the idea of a film telling multiple simultaneous stories with the actors taking on roles in each story and I hope more filmmakers take up this idea, though I don't believe it was executed very well in this movie.\n\nThe most prevalent problem I had with this movie is that I didn't feel like all of the settings were necessary to the overall timeline. I understood how the earliest plot had some connection to the one in 1936, and how that then had a connection to the story in 1973, yet then it feels like the film splits its' timeline as there seemingly isn't anything connecting onto 2012. Although each of the stories follow a theme of breaking away from societal struggles or expectations, they don't all have connecting plots. It somewhat felt like you could cut some of the timelines out of this movie with not much being lost.\n\nThe next problem I have is that there are parts in this film that sometimes felt a little pretentious. The one line I remember disliking the most from the film is \"You have to do whatever you can't not do.\" Which just is supposed to mean \"You have to do whatever you can.\"\n\nI hesitate to proudly call this film's presentations of scenes to be 'non-linear', though I admire how the film turned out in regard to its pacing. I can understand how others may get confused about following on with the stories constantly cutting between timelines, yet I feel that these stories could have only worked in this format. There are moments in each of these stories when the tension rises, where you'll find the film cutting in between the most, though I think it works here since I feel if all these scenes were split up more than the audience would get tired of the film trying to make them excited, while lumping multiple timelines' moments of exhilaration keeps the audience on their feet, yet prepared to cool down for slower, calmer scenes.\n\nSome of the story elements or characters by themselves didn't feel too fulfilling. Like with Somni-451 mostly just having her story being led by other characters and not showing much agency until the end of her timeline. I also didn't feel interested in moments like the ending of the 1973 timeline, since, like mentioned earlier, it has no plot point I noticed that connects to the future timelines.\n\nFor further notes, the film looked great to look at, with plenty of shots to be able to appreciate the acting as well as shots to appreciate the scenery/special effects. Most of the music didn't personally stick with me aside from the short piece that played when that car was pushed off the bridge, though I always felt like it did its job well.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do mostly like this movie, but mostly for the concept and the imagination, and not thinking that it's an overall good movie. I would recommend giving this film at least one watch as, again, I do wish to see concept like this explored more in other works.",

A film of disarming poetry, which enchants and surprises. The rebellious spirit of the Wachowski sisters, known to their fans, manifests in every frame, while an enveloping soundtrack, classically inspired, accompanies the viewer on an emotional and unforgettable journey. Great attention to every detail, the authors have achieved a fantastic philosophical-literary work.\n\nThis movie, unfortunately, is severely underrated.",
