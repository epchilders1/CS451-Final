This isnt because of its amazing CGI, Camera quality, plot, no none of that, it is because i can go to it for a good laugh anytime i want. When i dont know what to watch, white chicks it is. No matter how many times i watch it i always laugh, and so do the people i watch it with. Just make sure you are at least 13 before you watch the movie, a good, corny, and stupid joke movie",

It's exaggerated and for me that makes it even funnier. This movie is my go to favourite comedy. I can never get tired of watching it. It's so stupid and I love it. Everything came together well and no scene is wasted or boring or just a filler. This was a very clever movie.",

The toilet jokes were annoying, but sometimes I genuinely laughed, even tho it's better to laugh at bad films. It was cute, I will probably forget about watching it tomorrow, but maybe I'll even rewatch it. Could be worse, like scary movie.",

    "text": "I watched this after an acquaintance described it as a \"hilarious cult classic.\" It's lowbrow garbage that will appeal to a certain demographic, but I couldn't make it past the 45-minute mark. I had low expectations of the Wayans brothers, but nothing could have prepared for how excruciatingly unfunny this was. Some movies can be enjoyed by simply switching your brain off for a while, but this requires that you remove it and boil it in acid before launching it into the sun. It's unrelentingly idiotic and crude, which can work when done well and with a degree of self-awareness, but there's only so much slapstick and toilet humour I can endure. It'll probably be enjoyed by 12-year-old boys or those with the minds of 12-year-old boys. If this is what Americans think is gut wrenchingly funny satire it explains a lot.",
