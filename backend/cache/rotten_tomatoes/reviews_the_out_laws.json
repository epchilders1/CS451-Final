    "text": "This movie was defmitely not the best of 2023, not close to the best comedies out there, but it was enjoyable. This is a perfect family movie. No nudity or anything like that.\n\nA good movie these days is a rare thing, especially comedies.\n\nIts obviously low budget but that's why I rated it only a 3. A lot of room for improvement here and a bit goofy. But it kept me entertained all the way through, and that's what matters.\n\nThere's just one issue which I don't get it, maybe a plot hole towards the end, I don't want to give spoilers but that didn't make sense. Otherwise very good comedy. But I guess sometimes you just have to realize its a movie, just to have fun, and not think so seriously about it.\n\nActing was alright, pace was fantastic, never a dull moment",

    "text": "Had to bail 15 minutes in.  Just couldn\u2019t bear to watch it any more.  Adam DeVine\u2019s slapstick acting belongs in the Charlie Chaplin era.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever watched a movie where his character doesn\u2019t irritate me, even small parts.  He is not leading man material.  Pathetic puerile vulgar sex jokes and innuendo.  Just lazy script writing, which is the weakest element of this movie.  Not much better from Richard Kind\u2019s character.  I selected this because I hoped Pierce Brosnan would be in a reasonable movie but alas, no.  I feel sorry for him.  The critics rating (22%) is about right, and only for those that like this genre.",

It was packed with awkward moments, unfunny sexual jokes, unnecessary slurs, and a dull storyline. The dynamic between the clueless nice guy (Owen Browning) and the tough in-law (Pierce Brosnan) felt forced and ineffective.",

    "text": "Filme: Meus Sogros T\u00e3o pro Crime\t\t\t \nElenco: @nina @piercebrosnanofficial Ellen Barkin, @adamdevine @laurenlapkus @poornagraphy @michael_rooker @realrichardkind \nModelo: #com\u00e9dia #trash #a\u00e7\u00e3o\nDura\u00e7\u00e3o: 1h 35m\tAno: 2023\nMinha opini\u00e3o: O excesso do ator Adam DeVine na sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o exagerada estragou. Ou derrepente na escolha do protagonista errou. E tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o ferou aquela qu\u00edmica entre Nina e Adam \u00e9 casal que n\u00e3o convence. Como no caso de Pai em Dose Dupla onde tem a qu\u00edmica. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o boa esta com Ellen e Pierce que vemos a qu\u00edmica entre eles. Acredito que  fosse outro ator no lugar de Adam o filme poderia dar certo. Pois o roteiro e enredo n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ruim. Owen (Adam) esta vivendo com Parker (Nina), ele trabalha como gerente de banco. E chega o dia que Owen vai conhecer os pais de Parker; Lilly (Ellen) e Billy (Pierce) que na verdade s\u00e3o ladr\u00f5es de banco. E assim eles assaltam o banco do genro. Mas uma antiga amiga do casal esta atr\u00e1s deles Rehan (Poorna) uma atriz desconhecida da grande maioria, que faz o seu papel de mafiosa. E onde para Billy se livrar Rehar precisar\u00e1 da ajuda do genro. Kkkkk ent\u00e3o a confus\u00e3o esta feita, mas como disse com exageros de Owen. \nVale apena assistir? Se n\u00e3o tiver outra op\u00e7\u00e3o, mas n\u00e3o tiver mesmo. \nNota: 3",

    "text": "\"The Out-Laws\" features a charming cast led by Adam Devine and Pierce Brosnan, whose performances provide a delightful distraction from the film's predictable plot. With very low expectations going in, I found it to be surprisingly decent\u2014though it still falls short of true comedic brilliance. The humor didn't land as much as it should have for a comedy, leaving me chuckling only occasionally. The film feels soulless and lacks the creativity to offer anything new or memorable. While it serves as mindless entertainment, it's nothing more than that. Despite my initial apprehensions, it's not as bad as I expected, but I wish it had more depth and laughter. Overall, \"The Out-Laws\" is a watchable romp, but it\u2019s a far cry from being a standout comedy.",
