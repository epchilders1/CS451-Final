Just lived somewhat selfishly, discovered their lives, did what they felt was right instead of doing what they\u2019re supposed to do.",

    "text": "In general, it is a very good, light comedy film about a woman in a mid-life crisis, who is not happy with her life - her husband perceives her as a housewife, and her grown children - as a nanny. Therefore, one day Shirley packs her things and secretly flies to Greece for a short vacation - and meets a handsome Greek there. By the end of the film, he turns out to be nothing more than a fraud, pretending to be a loving husband in front of female tourists, and Shirley still stays at the hotel - already as a waitress who abandoned her past life in Britain. The only negative of the film is the open ending. In the end, a man does come to see Shirley, but we are not shown anything about what they talked about, nor how the meeting ended. \nMy rating: 8/10",
