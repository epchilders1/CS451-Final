    "text": "Aside from Scott\u2019s strong direction and the solid cinematography (also with some great soundtrack), the screenplay is very messy. It tries to weave the story it\u2019s adapting with ideas that contradict themselves, leaving the film confused about what it\u2019s actually trying to say. As a result, the drama and the characters\u2019 struggles fall flat, the plot feels bland, and it's ideas lack cohesion.",

    "text": "Though the movie was entertaining, it was entertaining for all the wrong reasons. It\u2019s impressive how bad it was. It strayed so far from the Bible, it was almost disrespectful to the faith. Some parts of the movie looked like a direct copy of Prince of Egypt, while others were entirely fabricated. The director seemed to have this obsession with making everything seem logical, that it completely ignored the spiritual aspect that is crucial to the movie. How can you make a biblical movie and then barely mention God? Speaking of God, the portrayal of Him was so wrong\u2014it didn\u2019t capture who God is at all. It just seemed like a creepy, mysterious kid; I didn\u2019t even realize that was supposed to be God until later. One good part of the movie was the plagues even though the crocodile scene was so far off.",

I think the director walked into a minefield of a topic that would offend many, and the perception of this film has suffered as such.",

    "text": "A complete misfire by Ridley Scott. It's amazing how he's so incredibly consistent throughout the eras with making masterpieces followed by complete misfires. So I can't really sayy I'm surprised. I've seen this story done tons of times from cheesy religious shorts, cartoons, and big budget epics that are some of the best films ever made about one of the greatest stories ever told in the history of humanity. So it's amazign how badly this misfires. The acting is just not good at all. Bale is one of the worst things. He's miscast and also just terrible as Moses. He's wooden, unlikeable, has no charm, and is taking things WAY too serious and going full tryhard mode. Moses is painted as a bumbling wizard almost who advocates for violence. Not a humble beacon for God's wonders good and bad. I do not believe for a second this person would have 400K people follow him. They made him into Malcom X instead of MLK basically. His chemistry with Ramsey is nonexistant. Everyone else is super forgettable or like Ramsey just as wooden and emotionless. The music is super boring and forgettable as well. The editing I will say is ok. This doesn't do anything ridiculously out of place and hits all the beats the Book of Genesis is supposed too. But it is missing so much and misfires on key moments in terms of delivery. A big reason why the cinematography isn't good. The first few minutes are pretty good actually but it just slowly loses life and direction quality goes down. Half the time it's so dark and dull you can barely see. The camerawork is super basic at times, the special effects are just ok and don't evoke any sense of wonder. It feels like it's trying to be so gritty and raw but it never focuses on the characters of Moses and Ramsey. We never really see them interact at all when Moses returns, we barely see Moses interact with his family, when he meets his wife it's done so sloppy, and the few interactions that are here are so lifeless and dull. Than there is the fact certain scenes are just done so badly. When the tree burns and Moses becomes God's chosen leader...Yeah have it dark and dull and have our hero covered in a mud pool like Dennis Hopper in Super Maroi Bros. The plagues that befall Egypt are done so sloppy as well and feel like they just happen. Making God into a whiny moody child was a terrible decision that they never really explain. Finally, the Red Sea...the most ICONIC moment in the film...is done so...nonchalant it's almost amazing. Like it parts and you don't even notice it...how...how in the world in whatever God you believe in's namedo you do that so....forgettably?!?! Like I somehow didn't even notice it parted. This all leads to terrible pacing. The Prince of Egypt did this an hour shorter and did so much more. The Ten Commandments was even longer and accomplished so much the entire way. This was a slog the entire way. This also can't figure out if Moses or God is the main focus because I swear it feels like Moses is an afterthought for the major bulk of the middle too. Skip this and watch any other Book of Genesis adaptation.",

We don't get any historical background.  We don't get secondary characters to care about.  We don't get adventure.  You'll spend most of this movie hoping it will end soon.",

Writing this from 2024, it is sad to see how we took these movies for granted.\nCompared to modern Epics rife with politically-correct BS, it is refreshing to watch a movie who's sole concern is epic visuals, story, and character development.\nLooking back/in retrospect it is clear that     our expectations have become so high because we have been gifted fantastic movies like this one in the past.",
