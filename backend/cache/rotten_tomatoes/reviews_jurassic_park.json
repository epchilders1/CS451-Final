In between you get everything: childlike wonder (Sam Neill\u2019s face the first time he sees a living dinosaur is still the most beautiful shot in blockbuster history), unbearable tension (the kitchen raptor sequence remains the scariest thing ever filmed with kids in it), and lines tattooed into pop-culture DNA (\"Life finds a way,\" \"Hold on to your butts,\" \"Clever girl\").\n\nThe ILM and Stan Winston effects were so revolutionary they still look flawless 32 years later (that T. rex breakout in the rain is more real than half of today\u2019s CGI). John Williams drops one of his three or four greatest scores ever (the main theme is literally the definition of \"epic\"). And the cast is pure gold: Sam Neill and Laura Dern with real-couple chemistry, Jeff Goldblum being the sexy chaos we all secretly wanted to be, Richard Attenborough as the dreamy mad-grandpa we all wished we had, and those kids (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) who never annoy and make you genuinely terrified when the raptors hunt them.\n\nJurassic Park didn\u2019t age. We aged around it. It\u2019s the movie that made an entire generation want to be paleontologists for a week\u2026 and then rewatch it a thousand more times.\n\nFive stars feels too small. This is the absolute pinnacle of entertainment cinema.  \n10/10. Welcome\u2026 to Jurassic Park. Thank you for changing everything forever. \ud83e\udd96\ud83c\udf3f\u26a1\u2764\ufe0f",

This film still holds up to this day, even in 2025. I remember as a kid falling in love with dinosaurs, and many of my friends did too, all because of this movie. I especially remember the Jurassic Park fighting game, where you were dinosaurs fighting each other. This is peak cinema.",

    "text": "Outside of the ridiculous \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d at the end and a few editing mistakes, this movie is a masterpiece; holds up to this day. With likable characters, great pacing, beautiful animatronics and computer effects, and stellar cinematography and visual storytelling, mainly due to the brilliant Steven Spielberg at the helm. Many of the sequels mainly suffer, from not only a lackluster script but a mundane sense of direction as well; not taking advantage of the movie\u2019s stars, the dinosaurs and their potential. Not this movie though; the dinosaurs, for their minimal screen time; under 15 minutes, steal the show whenever they appear. Not to mention the mesmerizing score by John Williams and his seamless ability to swiftly transition from adventurous, to fantastical, to mysterious, to thrilling, to child-like amazement, to terrifying! All of which consistently entertaining and not boring. The acting from everybody is great, making the most out of their respective personalities, particularly Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. Even the kids are good; not being incessantly annoying but annoying in a way that\u2019s believable. What ties it all together is the heart of the movie, the central themes of genetic engineering and chaos theory, and humane morals regarding man\u2019s hubris; going for man\u2019s warmness regarding family over an ambitious sense of confidence over nature.",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\n\u201cAn awe-inspiring adventure that redefined blockbuster filmmaking, Jurassic Park remains a towering achievement in both storytelling and special effects.\u201d\n\nSteven Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park roars to life with jaw-dropping visuals, unforgettable tension, and a sense of wonder that few films have matched since. From the first glimpse of a towering Brachiosaurus to the electrifying raptor chase in the kitchen, every frame pulses with cinematic magic.\n\nThe combination of John Williams\u2019 iconic score, groundbreaking animatronics, and early CGI creates an experience that feels as thrilling today as it did in 1993. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum anchor the spectacle with performances that balance scientific curiosity, human vulnerability, and sardonic wit.\n\nMore than just a monster movie, Jurassic Park is a meditation on ambition, chaos, and the limits of human control\u2014wrapped in one of the most exhilarating adventures ever put on screen.\n\nVerdict:\nA cinematic landmark that proves science and storytelling can be a perfect genetic match. Jurassic Park earns every one of its five stars.",
