    "text": "Typical DQ underdog sporting hero story, though this one appears a lot of the time to be more focused on the father of the hero, and his spiritual campaign, than the sportsperson the story is actually about. It's OK, but it misses the mark when compared to other similar stories of endurance, perseverance and personal growth",

    "text": "Dramma sportivo con fortissima spinta religiosa, tratto da una storia vera che poi \u00e8 essenzialmente la caratteristica che rende questo film interessante.\nLa sceneggiatura infatti \u00e8 piuttosto pesante e troppo classica; il racconto favorisce il dramma familiare ed esalta povert\u00e0, litigi e problematiche della famiglia, di fatto quasi totalmente tralasciando lo sport e la scalata del giovane protagonista, che viene riassunta in qualche scena strappalacrime senza nemmeno rendere comprensibile ai pi\u00f9, cosa stia succedendo a livello tecnico.\nDennis Quaid nelle interpretazioni potenti \u00e8 sempre ottimo attore e si distanzia notevolmente dal resto del cast.\nNel complesso per\u00f2 il film sembra girato nei primi anni 2000 per lo stile di regia e di sceneggiatura, rendendo poco fresco il prodotto.",

    "text": "I really enjoy watching movies based on real life, and The Hill fits in that category. Mr. Quaid did a true to life portrayal of a rural Southern preacher and the young actors made for very credible boys raised in a strict Christian setting. The pastor Dad learns his lesson in the end, that God\u2019s grace comes in different places and through the different talents He bestows upon His children. His stubbornness is melted by God as he realizes he has denied his son the very gift God had given the young man, even if only for a short season.",

It was difficult to watch, at times, just because life and people can be very difficult and this portrays a heavy side of that.  It's truly a film that will make you think about your own life and family relationships.",
