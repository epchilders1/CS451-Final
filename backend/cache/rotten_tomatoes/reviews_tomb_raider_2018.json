It could have been a bit more faithful in terms of the supernatural elements - it presents rational explanations to things that happen in the game, but Tomb Raider is not about that. Alicia Vikander is a great rebooted Lara Croft, yet very similar to what a classic version of Lara should be - which is great!",

    "text": "They hired Alicia Vikander for the role, an actress who is very different from the version of Lara Croft in the latest Tomb Raider game series, for this reason I decided to never see the movie, because for a film adaptation I did not want an identical actress, but at least I wanted her to have a medium or small resemblance, I do not despise Alicia Vikander for that, in fact I like this woman, I liked her before the movie was made and I still like her, although she should not play Lara Croft in such a movie, it was not at all suitable, since Lara in such a story is practically a young girl just out of her teens, the villains call her a child, while Alicia Vikander could not be called a child, in fact if in the movie they call Alicia Vikander a child, the viewers are stunned because she looks very mature, but that does not mean I am going to despise the actress, I simply refuse to see the movie and I am still a fan of Alicia Vikander although I consider it a mistake the fact that chosen to star in such a film.",

    "text": "A rather weak film. The legend of Himiko is interesting, but it\u2019s left unexplored\u2014just like the rest of the plot. There are way too many questions and far too few answers, with lots of miracle rescues and sudden revelations that the whole story relies on. I didn\u2019t like the soundtrack choices, and there are clearly too many sentimental moments\u2014though they don\u2019t really evoke much emotion.",

    "text": "Alicia Vikander was awesome for the role. Thing that pisses me off is that they made Lara a stubborn idiot. Her whole trip could've been so much easier if she would have just taken a moment to sign for her inheritance. She may have saved her dad with a proper team, better equipment, better boat and even a helicopter. Hell she could've taken guns, why you say, why not I say, you don't what or who you're gonna find. Also why tf did she even leave and become a regular Joe in the first place, just to struggle for a living when she doesn't need to. Typical Hollywood adding pointless struggle to the mix to try make things more interesting. Turned out okay though.",
