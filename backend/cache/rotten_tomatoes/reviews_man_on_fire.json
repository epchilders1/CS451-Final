The film builds perfectly, there's a twist you DO NOT see coming, and everything about the ending is absolute perfection, the location, the score, the performances, everything, better than pretty much any film I can name. If you asked me for my list of 5 films you must see, this would be one of them.",

It's not only a high-action film, it's also so touching how the protagonist comes alive through one encounter. I don't want to give away the plot so I won't say more. But really, watch it. I was glued from the beginning to the end. A masterpiece! Denzel Washington and Dakota Jackson were brilliant.",
