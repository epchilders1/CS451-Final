It was just OK movie and nothing more.\n\nToday i saw \"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.\n\nOverall, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.",

This is good old-fashioned, wild action, boasting breathtaking, practical flight sequences that are visceral and genuinely spectacular, all while delivering a surprisingly emotional and satisfying story.",

    "text": "The flight action sequences are spot on and allow the viewer insight into the talent of our top fighter pilots. Story mirrors the prequel in some respects but this is offset by the pace and visual impact of this movie. Storyline held together by the actors /actresses (not just leads) even if at times a bit unbelievable. A great film to watch again and again even if it is for the flight sequences.",
