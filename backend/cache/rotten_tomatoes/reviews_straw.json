YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT A PERSON MAY GO THROUGH. IT HAS A GOOD INTENTION AND ASKS OF US TO BE MORE KIND TO EACH OTHER.\nNOT GONNA LIE, AT FIRST I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL. I DIDN'T LIKE THE CAMERA ANGLES, EVEN ACTING FELT MEDIOCRE AT TIMES, PRODUCTION WAS LACKING AND IN GENERAL I WAS NOT A BIG FAN OF THE PRODUCTION. EVERYTHING CHANGED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVIE. IT KINDA PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER! YOU WILL BE SURPRISED. I CRIED AT THE END. IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.DESERVES IT'S FLOWERS!",

The ending was shocking and brought me to tears.",

For people out there who is looking for more perfection towards the storyline clearly don\u2019t understand the struggles of the cost of being sick. I suffer seizures myself every day and it\u2019s not just the cost that sets me back. It\u2019s having to live with it and try not be judged by other people when you\u2019re triggered.
