Its a shame because a couple of the cast are known for good work but it was hammy and predictable: cringy 1980s thriller (not thrilling). Watch this and lose 90 minutes of your life and you don't get compensated.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) La mujer del camarote 10 no inventa nada nuevo, pero sabe a lo que va: un thriller psicol\u00f3gico de ritmo \u00e1gil, con aire de novela de aeropuerto bien adaptada. Desde el primer minuto se mete en la acci\u00f3n y evita esas introducciones eternas que suelen lastrar el g\u00e9nero. Agradezco eso: no hay rodeos, ni discursos, ni pistas subrayadas con ne\u00f3n.\n\nKeira Knightley sostiene la pel\u00edcula con aplomo. Su personaje, una periodista algo inestable que presencia (o cree presenciar) un crimen a bordo de un lujoso yate, se mueve entre la paranoia y la lucidez con la elegancia habitual de la actriz. Es ella quien mantiene la tensi\u00f3n cuando el guion flojea, y quien da un m\u00ednimo de verdad a una historia que podr\u00eda haber naufragado sin su presencia.\n\nVisualmente est\u00e1 cuidada. La direcci\u00f3n aprovecha bien los espacios cerrados, el reflejo de los espejos, la sensaci\u00f3n de aislamiento en medio del mar. Todo contribuye a esa atm\u00f3sfera de sospecha donde nadie dice la verdad y cualquiera puede ser culpable. Hay ecos de Hitchcock, aunque sin su sutileza, y algo del whodunnit cl\u00e1sico pasado por el filtro de Netflix: limpio, bonito y un poco impersonal.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula se ve con gusto, pero no deja huella. Cumple como entretenimiento \u2014tenso, breve, bien producido\u2014, aunque su misterio se resuelva de forma demasiado c\u00f3moda. Da la sensaci\u00f3n de que podr\u00eda haber sido algo m\u00e1s si hubiera arriesgado un poco en el desarrollo de los personajes o en la ambig\u00fcedad moral.\n\nAun as\u00ed, no me aburr\u00ed en ning\u00fan momento. La mujer del camarote 10 tiene ritmo, oficio y la suficiente intriga como para mantenerte enganchado hasta el final. No pasar\u00e1 a la historia, pero funciona para una noche de sof\u00e1 y manta, con el mar golpeando de fondo y la sospecha flotando en el aire.\n\n(ENGLISH) The Woman in Cabin 10 doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the genre, but it knows exactly what it wants to be \u2014 a sleek, fast-paced psychological thriller that gets straight to the point. From the very first scene, it dives into the story without wasting time on endless introductions or forced exposition. That alone is refreshing in a sea of overcomplicated mysteries.\n\nKeira Knightley carries the film with confidence. Her character \u2014a slightly unstable journalist who witnesses (or thinks she witnesses) a murder aboard a luxury yacht\u2014 moves between paranoia and lucidity with the grace we expect from her. She\u2019s the glue that keeps everything together, even when the script starts to wobble.\n\nVisually, it\u2019s elegant. The direction makes smart use of confined spaces, mirrors, and the oppressive calm of the open sea. It builds that sense of isolation and doubt where everyone hides something and truth becomes slippery. There are hints of Hitchcock, though without his finesse, and a touch of whodunnit style polished for the Netflix era: glossy, pretty, and a bit impersonal.\n\nIt\u2019s enjoyable, if not memorable. The film delivers decent tension and solid craftsmanship, though the mystery resolves too neatly. It feels like it could have gone deeper \u2014 into its characters, or into the unease it hints at but never fully embraces.\n\nStill, I never got bored. The Woman in Cabin 10 is the kind of polished thriller that works perfectly for a quiet night: engaging, well-made, and just mysterious enough to keep you watching until the very end.",

They killed off a person who didn\u2019t die in the book and basically didn\u2019t bother to make the story make sense in a way that you could make a second movie and considering a second book does exist it would make sense not to change everything about this story. Stop using book titles for movies . Beautiful disaster and where the crawdads sing along with this movie are all perfect examples of failure to stick to key points of the story.",

    "text": "A nice looking thriller, with a top movie star like Kiera K, why not? Why not indeed. It\u2019s a whodunnit with flashes of horror in a confined space, a posh boat, milling around space or the sea, it\u2019s no Event Horizon or Triangle of Sadness, more like Steve Carell\u2019s Mountainhead with all of these billionaires plotting to AI the world, and the writers do manage to get AI facial recognition software in, but it turns out that this then becomes a plot twist, rather than an attempt to control the world. Norway is nice, but we have seen the billionaire retreat in Succession, and I probably should have just watched Murder on the Nile again, this looks nice but Kiera is the flashy whodunnit\u2019s only saviour, watch Guy P in the Brutalist, you don\u2019t really need to see him in this. Three out of five is a little generous but not bad for a streaming mid weeker.",

    "text": "A decent, mostly British, cast is totally squandered in this very mediocre film, which I can only imagine they agreed to participate in for a jolly on an actual $150m luxury yacht it's set on. Amazingly, it took 4 writers, including its director, Simon Stone, to adapt Ruth Ware's 2016 novel, which would've fit perfectly the literary thriller landscape at the time, but feels as dated, and clich\u00e9, as that title does now. Starting like an Agatha Christie, with a myriad of characters, including Keira Knightley's journalist Laura, being invited to a 3-day cruise to attend a fundraising gala in Norway by a terminally ill billionairess, it soon spirals into a frantic gaslighting exercise when no one believes Laura who's convinced that the woman in the cabin next door was thrown overboard on the first night. While Laura is constantly lauded as a brilliant and well regarded journalist, her crazy and unhinged behaviour never demonstrated any signs of that brilliance; while normally interesting character actors like Guy Pearce, Hannah Waddingham, David Morrissey, and others have nothing to do here as interchangeable character-less wealthy guests, merely there to fill up space. As a whodunnit, it's so blatantly obvious who did it, they might as well be twirling moustaches in the background, as that increasingly contrived and ludicrous plotting unfolds, with a climactic end that's nowhere near as clever or thrilling as the writers think it is. Coincidentally, the night before, I watched a 1945 B-movie called My Name Is Julia Ross which shared practically the same plot-twist, with Nina Foch playing the titular shrilly woman whom no one believed is telling the truth. I didn't buy the plot or Foch's acting in that film, and 80 years later, I don't buy this film or Knightley's acting either. Plus \u00e7a change.",
