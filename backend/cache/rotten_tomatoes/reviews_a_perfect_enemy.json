    "text": "Did you ever meet a creepy stranger in a public place who insisted on talking to you? That's what happens to Jeremiasz Angust (Tomasz Kot) in \"A Perfect Enemy.\" Angust is a renowned architect, lecturing in Paris. After the lecture, his driver is hurrying to get him to the airport, and a blonde girl in her 20's comes up to the car window and begs for a ride to the airport because she can't get a cab. She is Texel Textor (Athena Strates), an extremely chatty young lady from Holland. A few blocks down the street, she realizes that she left her suitcase in a doorway, so the driver has to turn around to get it. As a result, Jeremiasz is late for his flight, so he goes to the VIP lounge to wait for the next one. Textor appears and begins chatting him up again. \nThis time, the chat is not small talk. She tells him her abbreviated life story in three parts, the second and third of which include two murders that she committed. Jeremiasz is dubious, but he listens anyway.\nAs Textor recites her tales, we see them in gruesome flashbacks. We're not sure if she's telling the truth or lying.\nI hesitate to reveal much more. Suffice it to say, things get weird. In the VIP lounge, a small-scale architectural model of the airport (which Jeremiasz designed) mysteriously has puddles of blood on its floor. Textor follows Jeremiasz into the men's room and scrapes the floor with a sinister looking knife. Jeremiasz is also in a couple of the flashbacks. \nMy instinct in such a situation would be to get away from this weird stranger, but Textor, attractive and pixie-like, with exaggerated eye makeup, has a way of holding Jeremiasz' (and our) attention. She's petulant, immature, annoying, and downright strange. We feel absolutely no sympathy for her, yet we somehow can't ignore her. \n\"You're insane,\" says Jeremiasz.\" You need a therapist.\"\nTextor replies, \"Why would I go to a therapist when airports exist?\nIf you're thinking that this film is bonkers, you are correct. The silliness of it, filmed and acted so seriously, is disconcerting. I couldn't stop watching in spite of my skepticism.\nThis is a dialogue-heavy film, and bits of the acting are unnatural and awkward. And the reveal two thirds of they way through will have viewers rolling their eyes in disbelief. The rest of the movie descends into \"throw your credulity out the window\" territory. Actually, that's an understatement. \nBut in spite of its absurdity, damned if it didn't keep me watching. Sometimes, the ridiculous can be entertaining.",

    "text": "Although it is clear from the start that this is a psychological drama that would pull some viewers into detective work, the movie was successful in drawing me into the mystery, first of nature of the relationship of the two characters, and then deciphering the actual events before the plotline's narrative revealed those events, although there was always the suspicion that memories presented were false memories or intentionally misrepresented memories. I thought the acting was solid, the plot flowed smoothly albeit slowly a few times, and enough questions remained unanswered to entice me to visit a few review sites for clarification or explanation.",

And I usually like twist endings...\nWell, at least it was only 90 minutes.\nThese \"it was all in their head\" movies drive me crazy.\nAnd Texel Textor... Why oh why that name? And then keep repeating it as nauseum....",

    "text": "It is a psychological drama, a sexually frustrated, smart architect who killed his wife 20 years ago and dumped her body in construction site at the airport returns to Paris. Twenty years seem to have brought him fame and recognition ; however, his guilty conscience gives birth to a teenage girl, it is not clear whether she exists in his fantasy alone or is a real woman but her cryptic stories that start with a delayed flight pull him back to school days and thereafter of jealousy, greed and hunger to succeed.\n\nOur protagonist initially resists hearing the stories from his fantasy daughter that would have been a real 20 years youth had he not killed his wife; he eventually manages to dump her alive in the same material that was used to bury his wife's body.\n\nThose who understand the human psychology of murderers, white collar criminals shall find this movie based on a novel interesting; it is not perfect but successfully presents a limited picture of reality blurred into fantasy.\nAthena Strates  with the strange yet meaningful name of Texel Textor,  is perfect as a mysterious teen.",
