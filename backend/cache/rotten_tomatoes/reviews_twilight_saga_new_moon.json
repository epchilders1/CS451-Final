    "text": "Rating: 5.6/10\n\nNew Moon is a slow, depressing sequel that suffers from the absence of its main star, Edward Cullen.\n\nHighlights\n- Faithful Adaptation: The screenplay captures the core theme of Bella's depression and isolation.\n- Strong Performances: Taylor Lautner shines as Jacob Black, and Michael Sheen is delightfully campy as Aro.\n- Visual Style: Director Chris Weitz brings a new, warmer visual style, and the score is elegant.\n\nCriticisms\n- Weak Plot: The story sidelines Edward Cullen, making the central romance grind to a halt.\n- Passive Protagonist: Bella becomes a passive, moping character, lacking agency.\n- Slow Pacing: The direction is plodding, making the film a slog to watch.\n\nVerdict\nNew Moon is a commercially successful but critically-panned sequel that faithfully adapts the novel, but is marred by its slow pacing, weak plot, and awkward characters, making it the weakest entry in the saga.",

If in the first film there was a constant blue filter so you couldn't understand if it was day or night, now there's a new yellow one so it always looks sunny. Also, they killed off the old man that looked like Kung Fu panda. I liked him. Jacob looks like a lesbian mom of 6 with short hair, and also doesn't seem to own a shirt.",
