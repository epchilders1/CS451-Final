Funny story, cool concept, decent sophomore humor, it's a fun movie to watch, though predictable. I WILL be keeping this in my collection. Enjoy.",

I liked the locations, and the overall look of the movie is bright and upbeat with plenty of sunshine. Comedically though, it's a real mixed bag. Some of the setup's are good, but it doesn't seem to recognise when it crosses the line of good taste. It's a shame because with more care, it could have been a much better film.",
