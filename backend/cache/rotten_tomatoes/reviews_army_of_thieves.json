The plot was ludicrous, but undertaken with enough whimsy and sincerity to pull it off.\nThe action sequences were well done and well paced, and, I will admit it, the two leads had enough spark to make me wish the movie could have stayed with the suspension of disbelief a scene or two longer and given me a bit of a happier ending.",

The film doesn't take itself TOO seriously which plays well with the visuals and dynamics of the entire cast. \nIf you like heist style films and enjoy a bit of comedy, 100% recommend giving this one a try",

Witty dialogue, great sets/costuming and the action-scenes work. Heck, I'd watch a sequel/prequel of just these safe-crackers.",

I can mention many unbelievable circumstances, but they would contain spoilers, and if you're desperate for a good movie, this one will do.",
