I didn't dare review it after the first watch - surely I missed and/or didn't understand something? No. It is actually as bafflingly awful as it was when I first sat through it. What a monumental waste of talent, setting, and source material!!!!!",

Also it would becoming boring, it would feel pointless and confusing, you couldn't even enjoy this absolute masterpiece of Drama because the constant need to explain all around would Ruin the thrill.\n\nAND THAT is what they did to \"The Snowman\".\n\nB",

Characters come and go, adding nothing to the plot. I could go on, but basically, I watched this steaming pile of manure so you don\u2019t have to! AVOID!",

Ya there\u2019s some odd scenes and dialogue but kinda adds to the overall creepy-ness of the film.  I do wish the ending had been a bit more climactic there wasn\u2019t the payoff you were hoping for.",

But i still watched it, in hopes that it would be at least decent.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with Michael Fassbender but appart from a few good movies, he only seems to accept really weird, depressing and boring roles. \n\nSave your time and watch something else.",

Terrible direction, appalling editing by a renowned editor (though can't really be blamed as only had garbage to work with), disjointed scenes, unbelievably bad script. The only thing going for it is the snow-bound scenery. The high-calibre actors in this movie all made a major mistake signing up for this disaster.",
