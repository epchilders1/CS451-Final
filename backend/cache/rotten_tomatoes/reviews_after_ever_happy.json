    "text": "After Ever Happy. After. Ever. Happy. Attempting to invoke the saying 'Happy Ever After', the writers didn't how the title sounded, which leaves a jumbled mess, foreshadowing the movie. Though none have had excellent titles, this one may take the cake for one of the worst-titled movies of all time.\n\nStocked with the same break-up/make-up that has been redone multiple times in each installment, After Ever Happy cannot figure out any new ways to cause drama. Unsure which character to give MORE daddy issues to, the writers decide to give them to both by giving double daddy issues to Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and expanding on Tessa Young's (Josephine Langford) as well. I have never seen a character go through the same daddy issue arc, with 2 different fathers, but this franchise never fails to amaze me.\n\nWriting, filming, editing, and releasing with only one year between each installment, the lack of quality in the franchise is painstakingly evident. After Ever Happy continues to trick viewers into rewatching the same reskinned movie by changing the title. Thankfully, with only one left in the franchise, we are almost at the merciful end. This truly belongs in the Sewers of Cinema.",

Because the first movie was good, but then after that, it just completely diminished the film and completely throughout these characters to be boring and at the movies to be unwatchable. This is definitely one of those seagulls that you just are not here for. It's not something exciting and it just completely derails from what the actual movie should have been about, I do not believe this movie is something fun or exciting to even have in the background.",
