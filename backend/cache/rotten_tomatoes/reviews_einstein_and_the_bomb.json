    "text": "Fairly interesting story of Einstein's relocation to England and eventually to the USA against the backdrop of the increasing horror of the uprising of Hitler's Germany. Einstein's involvement in the bomb is only briefly touched on and you are left wondering what the point of the film was. The actor in the lead doesn't suit the part and his poor makeup is a constant distraction.",

    "text": "The lesser known side of Albert Einstein; It is not only the reason why he fled Germany, and where he got the inspiration for his studies on relativity, it is the approximate truth of whether or not he had anything to do with the construction of the atomic bomb. The follow-up, far from being tedious, turns out to be absorbing, even for those who do not like documentaries.",

    "text": "I have admired Albert Einstein and his accomplishments my entire life and I was really looking forward to this Netflix documentary. I was hoping to learn more about Albert einstein, his life, and of course His Brilliant discoveries. Unfortunately, what this documentary delivered was a series of political lectures pertaining to the early 20th century in conjunction with what I thought were very awkward dramatic reenactment. Finally, Einstein's many breakthroughs in mathematics and physics were glossed over so lightly that you might think he was more of a political figure after watching this, which he was not. Finally the title itself reveals how misguided this documentary is. It focuses on something that Einstein had very little to do with (the creation of the atomic bomb) while all but ignoring some of his greatest accomplishments which were in physics, mathematics and cosmology.",

    "text": "There's just not much in this and it isn't worth watching. Einstein had nothing to do with the bomb and was excluded from the Manhattan Project - as this film admits - because he was a staunch pacifist. What does that leave you with, in a film that tries to put the two together? Nothing really.",

Also, Japan refused to surrender, contrary to attempts now to rewrite that history.   \n\nUnfortunate it had to be used, but the Atomic bombs saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers that would have had to invade Japan.",

In an era where entertainment often trumps educational content, this documentary serves as a beacon of enlightenment, offering a rare glimpse into the mind of one of history's greatest thinkers.",
