Don't treat it as any more than that and you will be fine... like that Hugh Jackman Van Helsing flick.  That all said, the story wasn't very gripping, and there way too many subplots.  What about his kid (that is very rarely in the film)?  His rivalry with Ares?  Love interest?  Fellow half brother?  Zeus and his brother/father issues?  I could go on but there are so many of these threads that are never satisfactorily addressed, but each could have made its own flick.",

    "text": "Wrath of the Titans is bigger, bolder, and more emotionally resonant than its predecessor, delivering a powerful gut punch. Where the first film held back, this sequel goes for the jugular. Perseus is a more fully realized character, Ares proves to be a far more formidable and ruthless villain than Hades, and Kronos emerges as a standout movie monster - picture a walking volcano. The film's biggest, and possibly only, failing is that Kronos isn't given enough screen time.",

This and it's predecessor Clash of the Titans (which I slightly preferred of the two) are both high quality sword and sandal movies with excellent special effects, good acting from the star studded cast and are obviously based upon epic tales. Ignore the haters who I suspect many of which have never actually really watched either of them and enjoy both of these quality movies.",

Much like the previous film, this installment turns a concept that should be an absolute joyride into a predictable, below-average fantasy movie and never really much else.",

    "text": "I'm split on this one! In some ways I kinda prefer 'Wrath of the Titans' to its predecessor, though in other ways it is a downgrade.\n\nMy positives include the pacing and the use of 'the gods', with both - in my opinion - better done in this 2012 film when compared to the 2010 original. The shorter run time helps, while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are far better utilised this time.\n\nMy negatives include the story and (one or two) new cast/characters. The plot didn't really hold my attention very well, at a number of moments I felt my mind drift away from what was occurring onscreen. I wasn't bored or anything, though I could feel myself lose interest immediately after a scene that promised more than it delivered. As for the latter, Rosamund Pike and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez are disappointing additions.\n\nWith that said, Bill Nighy is a newcomer here and he actually entertained me - probably my standout character from this sequel. Toby Kebbell is a solid newbie too, to be honest. Elsewhere, Ramin Djawadi is missed on music but Javier Navarrete does a perfectly fine job in fairness.\n\nNaturally, I can only speak for myself and to me this is an average, if admittedly forgettable, flick - nought worse.",
