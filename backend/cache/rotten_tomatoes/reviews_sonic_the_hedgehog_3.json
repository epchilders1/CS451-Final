The writing is not as good, many jokes are too corny, etc. If you like Sonic and/or watched the first two movies, sure, watch this, it's OK.\nJim Carrey is pretty good, as usual, and Keanu as Shadow is really nice, he really nails that depressed-frustrated-edgy voice.",

    "text": "Sonic 3 delivers an enjoyable and energetic adventure that will please fans of the franchise. The visuals are bright and engaging, and the action sequences maintain a good pace throughout. The humor is light and often hits the mark, making it entertaining for both younger audiences and longtime fans. Some plot elements feel predictable and a few characters are underdeveloped, but these do not significantly detract from the fun experience. Overall, Sonic 3 is a solid entry in the series that entertains and excites, even if it does not fully reach its potential.",

    "text": "Sonic 3 is an absolute mess of a film.\nThe story, on paper, does sound like a unique concept, but its ruined when Jim Carey returned as Dr. Eggman with no explanation, which you can tell that was a last minute rewrite into the film's production.\nThe jokes are terrible and unfunny, and sometimes cringe to even hear.\nAnd they hired Keanu Reeves, who in my opinion, was a terrible actor for Shadow because he didn't have the right attitude and it felt like a marketing tactic rather than being an interesting addition.\nAlso, I blame the Knuckles TV series for ruining Sonic 3's reputation.\nAs for Sonic 4, no thanks, I've seen enough of the franchise.",

And the action scenes, being some of the dullest, most stiffly choreographed ever conceived, just won't save that. \nSo you may as well watch Sonic Prime instead.",
