Lo peor fue el nudo de la misma, no tiene sentido, cada vez que decian algo al respecto me causaba rabia de lo ridiculo que era.\nNo me termin\u00e1 de convencer, no me sent\u00ed mal por nadie mas que por la pareja de la nieve. Lo de la cadena de metal fue inesperado, si tan solo todo eso no pasara en 5 minutos quizas y si me sentia re mal, pero solo daba rabia.\nEs entretenida si estas con alguien mas.",

Spoiler Alerts: The mean neighbor seemed cliche and it didn't make sense that the Animal Control wouldn't just remove the remaining cats especially since the main animal control character was all over Bella.  Lucas is studying for the MCAT but is a case manager and no reference is made to him studying to be a physician.  They could have used real footage of the mountain lion and wolves and just used the CGI for certain scenes. Real animal footage would have enhanced the film greatly. Appreciated the Veterans and the value of therapy dogs. Touching film but too much dog suffering.",

    "text": "No spoilers\n\nThe scenes where it was just Bella or Bella and big kitten were very good. Impressive composition and scenes involving no CGI (save for big kitten, who looked oooh kaaaaay,) the dog was the best actor in the show. The problem came from the humans, it felt like a Disney channel movie when they were on screen. The final act felt sudden and rushed, bad pacing like a lot was cut out. Also, no explanation on how she traveled 400 miles suddenly. It could have been better, but it was ok. The CGI was a little cringe worthy, especially in the first 10 mins being able to see the line around cgi puppy Bella, and the scene where she grows up made me laugh out loud from how stupid it looked. Still cried the whole time. I love you Bella \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
