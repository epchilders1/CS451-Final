    "text": "Jessica Watson's story has long deserved a movie. I always love seeing Aussie stories in film and what the Aussie industry is capable of. This movie is great, inspiring, engaging and has very pleasant colours. Teagan Croft and all of the cast were really good. Movie's based on true stories always add more dramatic elements but that is what helps it to work on film. I did feel that the pace should've been slower in some story beats, particularly I the movie's set up. But True Spirit captures the true spirit of Jessica. Go see it!",

    "text": "The movie had potential but it was really painful to watch how stupid the main character is.  She has an entire night to prepare for a storm and she's doing all the things during the storm.  Among the many other stupid things this character does.  I know she's just a kid but she was not responsible enough to do this trip.  Also being the youngest is just a stupid concept for example how young do you go?  Is the next one going to be 15 or 14 it's just a stupid concept this shouldn't be a record.  The characters are also dry and forgettable.  Mostly watched while doing other things it couldn't keep my attention for long periods of time.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Um filme de fato veridico, Onde Jessica Watson uma garota de 16 anos quer se tornar a mulher mais jovem mulher a dar a volta ao mundo dentro de um veleiro, um desafio que durou 7 meses. Temos Bem que \u00e9 o seu coach seu l\u00edder. E temos Julie e Craig que s\u00e3o seus pais e mais seus irm\u00e3os. A fam\u00edlia de velejadores onde Jessica encotra seu desafio de dar a volta ao Mundo sem atracar seu veleiro em terra, vendo que um outro jovem havia feito. E na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o ela colide seu veleiro com navio, sem dinheiro para concertar  o veleiro, amigos da vizinhan\u00e7a ajuda a reformar. E assim ela sai no mar, passa pelo sul das Am\u00e9ricas, alcana a linha do Equador, ultrapassa o sul da Africa, enfreta uma grande tempestade que pensou que iria morrer, mas o veleiro aguenta firme. At\u00e9 que passa por um per\u00edodo longo sem vento no meio do oceano e entra em desespero, mas ao final alcan\u00e7a seu objetivo. Quando ela parte um pequeno povo foi se despedir e com a m\u00eddia colocando em xeque sua aventura. Quando ela conclui tem milhares de pessoas a esperando, al\u00e9m de toda a m\u00eddia e pol\u00edticos. E hoje \u00e9 a jovem mais nova a dar a volta ao Mundo. Um filme de supera\u00e7\u00e3o e conquista. A atriz Teagan tem uma boa atua\u00e7\u00e3o. Um filme bem constru\u00eddo com as limita\u00e7\u00f5es or\u00e7ament\u00e1rias. Vale assistir.\nRoteiro e enredo medianos.\nVale apena assistir? Sim, para dar um Up em suas emo\u00e7\u00f5es.\nNota: 6,5",
