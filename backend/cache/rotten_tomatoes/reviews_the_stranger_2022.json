Webster's  dictionary defines a thriller as  \"a work of fiction or drama designed to hold the interest by the use of a high degree of intrigue, adventure, or suspense\".   This movie did none of that because the only element of the story that was not revealed in the first few minutes  was the outcome of the investigation, which was never revealed.  If the ending was meant to (finally) create suspense or leave me wanting more, it didn't succeed.  It did, however succeed in annoying me.  My husband made the right call.  Twenty minutes in he declared the movie a crashing bore and went to bed.  I should have done the same.",

Truly visceral, but there's no denying you need to steel yourself for it. I particularly enjoyed the score, and the varying blends of tension and mood drifting throughout. Superb lead performances and a great example of a low budget/ big impact production.",

    "text": "An interminable film,  I watched to this to the very end, but only because I'd already invested too many precious minutes in it (sunk-cost fallacy). \nThis is a prime example of a film without an assertive producer: someone who could discipline the director and prevent him allowing what should have been a gripping story from degenerating into a turgid mess. A pity, because \nthere are some talented performances, striking cinematography and a good atmospheric score. It reminded me of The Irishman- another film that also appeared to lack a decent producer.\nAs with Scorsese, someone needed to tell this director to can the boring scenes: long ones when the two main characters sit beside each other in a succession of cars; dull tracking shots of Australian roads: and frequent non-sequiturs that break the narrative flow. \nThis is a film where nothing appears to happen, but the end comes and you realise lots actually has. And it feels far too long (nearly two hours but feels like three).",
