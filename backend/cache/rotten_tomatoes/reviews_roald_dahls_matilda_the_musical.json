There are some surprisingly emotional and really dark moments and it makes the movie even better! My personal favorite part was Emma Thompson as Mrs.Trunchbull. While everybody did amazing, Trunchbull stole every scene she was in!!&",

    "text": "It's a fun movie for kids.  My daughter loves it!  One thing I think some of the people who have reviewed don't understand is that this is not a remake of the 1996 film.  This is an adaptation of Matilda The Musical, hence its name . . . Matilda the Musical.  The musical numbers and dances are (mostly) adapted from the Broadway musical, though there is one song that was added for the film - and a few that were cut.  If you're not into Broadway musicals, then you should probably skip this.  I personally love them, so I find this film quite enjoyable.  If you don't like Broadway, but your kid(s) (under the age of 12 at least) are bugging you to watch this, just grab your phone or something and suffer through it.  They'll love it!",

    "text": "They caught the feel of the original movie. I love this movie almost as much as I do the first. The songs are wonderful and the headmistress's character was awesome not to mention the execution. The only thing I didn't like is how in the original, Ms. Trunchbull actively swung around while holding Amanda from her pig tails and the whole scene was long and drawn out and showed Amanda in active danger which really added to how threatening the Trunchbull is. But this one, it was so short and no drawn out action. Just a single swing and she's off. Other than that, great movie and great songs.",

The rest of the cast were woody and the whole movie is a car crash that never got out of first gear.  If you've watched the original from the 90's, then this night and day.",

Musicals on film can always be tricky and as much as this might work as a theatre show it really didn't work for me as a film. It was confusing in parts and incredibly hard to follow the story even though I have watched the original at least 50 times. \n\nIf you grew up with the 96 version I would avoid this at all costs \ud83e\udd23",
