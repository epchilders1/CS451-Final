And the friends he\u2019s around in this movie is awesome. And I think I Miguel O\u2019Hara is the best villain for this movie, and that fight scene at the end is COOL AND INSANE. Listen i could keep milking and glazing this movie. Totally, deserves 5 stars\ud83d\udc4c",

    "text": "I really do like this movie but it really does lack in some aspects and characters. One main thing I really didn\u2019t and honestly just don\u2019t like for all movie so not just this Spider-Man movie but every movie that leaves you on a cliffhanger. Usability a film could take around 1 or 2 years depending on how long the film is which for this series has toke about 4,5 or 6 years to make 2 movies which is very long. Second reason why is the underdevelopment of all of the spidermen or spider-whatever\u2019s were there. Third and final reason why is the length of the movie and what was happening which watching the movie felt like I was only watching the chase scene in the Spider-Verse which was about 40 to 60 minutes of the movie. Otherwise, I like this movie movie and enjoyed watching the movie but my few complaints.",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nA breathtaking visual triumph and an emotionally rich sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings even higher than its predecessor in scope and ambition. It\u2019s a stunning blend of artistry, heart, and chaos\u2014an animated epic that proves superhero storytelling can be as moving as it is mind-blowing.\n\nShameik Moore once again delivers a standout performance as Miles Morales, now older, wiser, and facing the weight of destiny. Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s Gwen Stacy takes on a more central, poignant role, giving the film a powerful emotional core. The animation is nothing short of revolutionary\u2014each universe bursting with its own distinct art style and personality.\n\nThough its sprawling narrative and cliffhanger ending may frustrate some, Across the Spider-Verse remains an audacious, deeply human adventure that pushes both animation and the Spider-Man mythos to exhilarating new heights.\n\nIt\u2019s bold. It\u2019s beautiful. And it\u2019s proof that superhero cinema still has the power to surprise.",
