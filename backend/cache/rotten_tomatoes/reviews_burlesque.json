    "text": "Some movies aren\u2019t just entertainment\u2014they\u2019re timestamps. Burlesque is one of them for me.\n\nI first watched Burlesque when I was six years old at my cousin\u2019s house. Her mom put it on, and the room lit up\u2014not just from the glitter and stage lights on screen, but with laughter, excitement, and something electric in the air. Back then, we were neighbors. I remember running barefoot with my cousin through the big green lawns that separated our semi-large houses, cutting through that small, lush forest that felt like a magical world of our own. Watching Burlesque in that setting was like stepping into a fantasy of feathers, sequins, dreams, and fire.\n\nThe story follows Ali (Christina Aguilera), a small-town girl with a big voice who escapes hardship and lands in a glamorous L.A. burlesque lounge. Sure, the critics weren\u2019t kind to it, but let\u2019s be real\u2014six-year-old me didn\u2019t care about the Tomatometer. I saw sparkle, ambition, and power. I saw women owning the stage and their identities. I saw Cher as a goddess of survival. And I saw dreams that looked bigger than life\u2026 but somehow felt reachable.\n\nThe music stayed with me for weeks, especially Christina\u2019s powerhouse numbers. Even as a child, I felt the raw emotion in her voice. I didn\u2019t know what it meant to \u201cleave it all behind\u201d yet, but something in her eyes told me that this was a movie about becoming who you are\u2014no matter where you start. That stuck with me.\n\nLike Moulin Rouge!, Burlesque became part of my personal mythology. It\u2019s loud, bold, a little messy\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what made it beautiful. Looking back, I see it was more than just a fun musical. It was a vision of transformation, of finding your voice when no one else hears it yet.\n\nI still think of that night at my cousin\u2019s. The way we danced after the credits. The way we all believed, just for a moment, that we belonged on a stage too. That\u2019s the magic of Burlesque. That\u2019s why it\u2019s still gold to me.",

Drama, romance, lots of style, sultryness, and Cher and Christina. What's not to like? Are the critics all uptight religious fanatics? This movie is a great date night film.  Finally, an entertaining story for adults with an amazing soundtrack and compelling characters, and no murderor mayhem. Ignore the critics, and watch it.",

The soundtrack is amazing, a simple storyline and a good cast, I love Cher and since Burlesque, Christina Aguilera. If you like musicals, there is plenty in this to keep you happy.",

    "text": "Is the plot trash? Ok it is. A girl from nowhere but has the voice of Christina Aguilera moves to LA and \u2026 just wants to perform at a small burlesque club. Why?\n\nThe intro to the club complete with band moving onto the stage and Alan Cummings is such a cabaret rip off it is almost cringe. The intro to the club also mentions a financial crisis at the first of the month, so her journey from being club waitress, dancer, singing star, falling in love, negotiating a financial deal and everything else that feels like months (to the point they have a time goes by video montage) happens in less than 30 days.\n\nThat all being said it is so bad it\u2019s wonderful. The club focus keeps the world small but personal. The overall plot is very different from cabaret \u2014 yet part of that strips it of depth and meaning. The bartender is a hottie while Cher and Christina are amazing. 5 stars, even if the plot is trash lol.",

It's become a bit of a cult classic. \n\nAlso, the storyline is pretty identical to Coyote Ugly and I'm not mad about it \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

    "text": "I found \"Burlesque\" to be just okay\u2014not a film that I would consider exceptional or one that I\u2019d want to revisit anytime soon. In fact, I\u2019ve only watched it once since its release, featuring Cher and Christina Aguilera in the lead roles.\n\nThe film follows the story of a young woman who gets involved with a group of burlesque dancers, with Cher playing the role of the club owner. While the singing was impressive, I felt that the film's narrative was somewhat disjointed. It struggled to maintain focus, and the writing seemed all over the place, failing to guide viewers on a cohesive journey. Instead, it relied heavily on musical performances, which left the overall plot feeling a bit flat.\n\nBoth Christina and Cher delivered commendable performances given the material they had to work with. They brought their star power to the screen, trying to elevate what could have been a standout film featuring two megastars. However, despite their efforts, \"Burlesque\" didn\u2019t quite capture the excitement or depth I was hoping for, making it a movie that didn\u2019t spark my interest for repeat viewings. It felt more like a film that existed simply to showcase its stars rather than to tell a compelling story.",

In detail the plot isn\u2019t great, a run of the mill small town girl makes it big type, but then again nothing to truly hate on.",
