    "text": "It almost feels like this one should get an even higher rating, yet it was a bit on the slow side and there was a strange feeling of disconnect between the ending and the story afterwards of the protagonist raising 4 children - must have been foster children, but where how did they come into her life? The mountain scenery is always a winner for me and though understandable that there wasn't much talking - these are people who have suffered losses and live a lot within themselves, trying to make it one more day - the dialogue there was, was repetitive and mostly \"come on\" and cursing.",

I thought they could have done a better job with the special effects - the blizzard was pretty lame. Not a fan generally of Naomi Watts\u2019s work & this movie was no exception.",

But why have them in a mountain accent? . Headwear, head cover, goggles, gloves, water in a bottle that is there and then it isn't.. Failure to use proper natural shelter..  cringe almost laughable.. and what's with the guy in shorts?",

This one is no exception. You could tell from the beginning it was going to be bad. The beautiful and grim natural setting couldn\u2019t save it. I really tried to give it a chance but after 20 minutes I got tired.",

Very believable and acting so good that there is a lot of frustration with the action. But well worth it.",
