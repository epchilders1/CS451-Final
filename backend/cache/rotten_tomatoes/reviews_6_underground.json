I've watched this several times now and I am still just as gripped as the first time I watched it, which I find rarer and rarer to get from action films these days. The uniqueness of the storyline is something I commend highly and definitely recommend if you want your eyes to be gripped on the screen the whole time.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Michael Bay nunca enga\u00f1a a nadie: si te sientas a ver una de sus pel\u00edculas, sabes lo que vas a encontrar. Explosiones, persecuciones imposibles, humor descarado y un montaje que no da tregua. Aqu\u00ed lo lleva al extremo desde la primera secuencia, una persecuci\u00f3n en Florencia que parece alargarse hasta el infinito y que ya marca el tono de lo que viene despu\u00e9s.\n\nLa trama es poco m\u00e1s que una excusa para unir a seis personajes que act\u00faan fuera del sistema, pero lo cierto es que la historia importa menos que el espect\u00e1culo. Bay se recrea en la violencia estilizada, en los planos imposibles y en esa est\u00e9tica de videoclip que tanto le gusta. El resultado puede cansar a ratos, pero tambi\u00e9n consigue que el ritmo no decaiga en ning\u00fan momento.\n\nRyan Reynolds es el ancla c\u00f3mica de la funci\u00f3n. Interpreta pr\u00e1cticamente una variaci\u00f3n de s\u00ed mismo, con sus bromas r\u00e1pidas y su actitud de antih\u00e9roe sarc\u00e1stico. Puede que no todos sus chistes funcionen, pero encaja bien en este universo pasado de vueltas. El resto del equipo cumple sin destacar demasiado, aunque la din\u00e1mica de grupo le da algo de aire fresco a la trama.\n\nNo es una pel\u00edcula para buscar coherencia ni profundidad. Su valor est\u00e1 en la energ\u00eda desbordante y en lo excesivo de su propuesta. Es el Bay m\u00e1s desatado, para bien y para mal. Si entras en el juego, es f\u00e1cil divertirse con sus ocurrencias visuales y con la escala de la acci\u00f3n, que solo podr\u00eda costear una superproducci\u00f3n de Netflix.\n\nEn definitiva, una monta\u00f1a rusa que entretiene mientras dura, aunque dif\u00edcilmente deje huella una vez terminan los cr\u00e9ditos. Quien busque puro escapismo lo encontrar\u00e1; quien espere otra cosa, mejor que no se acerque.\n\n(ENGLISH) Michael Bay never deceives anyone: if you sit down to watch one of his films, you know exactly what to expect. Explosions, impossible chases, cheeky humor, and editing that never takes a breath. Here he pushes it to the limit right from the first sequence, a chase in Florence that feels endless and sets the tone for everything that follows.\n\nThe plot is little more than an excuse to bring together six characters who operate outside the system, but the truth is the story matters less than the spectacle. Bay indulges in stylized violence, impossible shots, and that music-video aesthetic he loves so much. The result can get tiring at times, but it also ensures the pace never slows down.\n\nRyan Reynolds is the film\u2019s comedic anchor. He basically plays a variation of himself, with quick jokes and the attitude of a sarcastic antihero. Not all of his gags land, but he fits well into this over-the-top universe. The rest of the team does their job without standing out too much, though the group dynamic adds some fresh air to the story.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a film to look for coherence or depth. Its value lies in the overflowing energy and the excess of its proposal. It\u2019s Bay at his most unrestrained, for better and worse. If you play along, it\u2019s easy to have fun with his visual flourishes and with the scale of the action that only a Netflix blockbuster could afford.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a roller coaster that entertains while it lasts, though it\u2019s unlikely to leave much of a mark once the credits roll. Those looking for pure escapism will find it; anyone expecting something else should probably stay away.",

I think if some people would just give their pucker pressure released a bit, they might find this and other movies not perfect, but entertaining.",

Reminded me of the 80s flicks when adventure movies were entertaining.  If things don't blow up, no fire, fights, gun battles... it just wasn't fun to watch.  I can't believe Netflix made a sequel to Old Guard but passed on 6 Underground.  Wow...",

Action was fantastic and Ryan Reynolds and the team kept the down to earth comedy keeping this alive!! Movies like Sinners was rated high, yet this one low...why i do not take heed to most of what \"critics' say.",

Lots of logic gaps in the plot which are unrealistic fantasy.  Typical Ryan Reynolds babel dialogue which I use to assume was poor direction but now realise is his  hallmark which I find annoying.  Almost a slap stick comedy.",

    "text": "This movie takes both the greatest weaknesses of Ryan Reynolds as an actor, and all the flaws of Michael Bay as a director and combines them into one big mess of a movie.\n\n\"6 Underground\" set a record for how quickly it could upset an audience and have them turn off the movie. In the day and age where movies try to sell themselves in the first 5 minutes, that way they don't switch what their streaming on Netflix. Thankfully this movie made it clear in the first 5 minutes that this movie was not concerned with character, story or filming with any clarity.\n\nThis would be the very example I would show to a class of how not to shoot an action scene. It is cut to pieces; camera is always moving, and the audience cannot tell what is going on.\n\nNot much to say. Bad characters, bad action and bad story, a bad time to be had.",

After that, the soundtrack drags it through the mud.  Whoever was the post producer for the music has terrible taste, or whatever made this soundtrack happen just really killed the whole film.  It should have been scored more elegantly.",
