E a ternura que transmite desde as brigas e discu\u00e7\u00f5es entre eles e isso se transforma em um amor t\u00e3o forte que at\u00e9 mesmo quando Gabby fica em coma e todos falam para desistir o amor deles faz com que ela acorde e vivam felizes para sempre. O come\u00e7o, temos o casal Gabby e Ryan (Tom) e o outro casal Travis e M\u00f4nica (Daddario). Mas tem que viajar para uma confer\u00eancia e Monica tamb\u00e9m fica ausente por uns dias. E isso faz com que oportunidades Gabby e Travis se conhecerem emlhor gra\u00e7as ao cadela de Gabby e por Travis se veterin\u00e1rio e tamb\u00e9m vizinhos. Para rolar aquele clima e de se apaixonarem. Mas quando Ryan e Monica. Gabby e Travis confessam oque havia acontecido e quando Gabby vai embora Travis vai atr\u00e1s e eles se casam. Tem 2 filhos, mas em uma noite Gabby sofre um acidente que a deixa em coma. Mas ela volta como em um milagre e todos vivem felizes para sempre.\nRoteiro e enredo genial, um roteiro simples, mas a magia dos atores Palmer e Walker fizeram toda a diferen\u00e7a neste filme, com foi de Bullock junto com Reeves em \u201cA Casa do Lago\u201d ou Kutcher com Peet em \u201cDe Repente \u00e9 Amor\u201d.\nVale apena assistir? Sim Com certeza. E Acompanhado \u00e9 melhor.\nNota: 8,5",

    "text": "Alright, let\u2019s be real here\u2014at some point, we\u2019ve all caved to the guilty pleasure that is a Nicholas Sparks movie. You can\u2019t fault me for loving a good romance that grabs you by the feels and doesn\u2019t let go. And when the mood calls for a solid cry session, I\u2019m not above throwing on one of these heartstring-tugging flicks. The Choice fits that bill perfectly. It\u2019s got all the classic Sparks hallmarks: emotional stakes, life-altering decisions, and just the right amount of drama to keep you hooked from start to finish.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the deal: Teresa Palmer is an absolute powerhouse in this. She brings Gabby to life with a mix of vulnerability and strength that makes her super easy to root for. You can\u2019t help but love her, and honestly, Palmer just radiates in every scene. Benjamin Walker? Not as big of a name, but he holds his own. There\u2019s this quiet intensity he brings to Travis, and when he finally pours his heart out? Yeah, you feel it. It\u2019s one of those performances that sneaks up on you.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk chemistry\u2014because it\u2019s all about that in these kinds of movies, right? Palmer and Walker totally sell it. From their flirty, awkward moments to those deep, emotional scenes, you can feel the sparks flying. It\u2019s that kind of romance that has you saying, \u201cOkay, I see you, Nicholas Sparks, I see what you\u2019re doing here.\u201d\n\nAnd just when you think it\u2019s all smooth sailing, bam! The emotional rollercoaster kicks in, because of course, it\u2019s a Sparks movie\u2014there has to be a tear-jerking twist. Without giving too much away, Travis finds himself facing some pretty gut-wrenching decisions, and that\u2019s where the film really hits its stride. You know the drama\u2019s coming, but man, does it hit you hard when it does. You\u2019ll be glued to your seat, tissues in hand, bracing yourself for the inevitable.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Tom Welling\u2014who\u2019s looking way more Superman than Clark Kent these days\u2014and Tom Wilkinson, who plays Travis\u2019 dad with the kind of gravitas only Wilkinson can deliver. And hey, South Carolina has never looked more gorgeous! The cinematography captures those sweeping landscapes so beautifully, it almost feels like a character in itself.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Choice knows exactly what it\u2019s aiming for\u2014and it nails it. It\u2019s not out to reinvent the wheel, but it doesn\u2019t have to. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet, heartfelt romance with just enough drama to keep things interesting, this movie\u2019s got you covered. It\u2019s charming, it\u2019s emotional, and it\u2019s everything you want from a Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Go into it with your heart wide open, and you\u2019ll walk away with all the feels.",

    "text": "Out of the Nicholas Sparks films I have sat through so far, \"The Choice\" is easily the worst. Outside of just following a formula with forced sad events happening, the movie is also pretty boring. And even though it is boring, it is also a problem because the bedrock of the film's core romance is a result of cheating and dishonesty which makes it hard to root for the main couple. I will say I think the movie has some gorgeous scenic shots because of its setting but it was a chore to get through. I don't even think the movie is all that romantic and think genre fans deserve better. Overall, I think it's good February is over because after this movie I think I need a break from the Sparks cinematic universe.",

This is what makes this movie good. A simple story. Beautiful talented actors. Easy dialogues. The proposal scene is epic. The last 15 minutes always put me into a coma. It's like there is a new story. And it's at odds with the light comedy genre. Hence a star off.",
