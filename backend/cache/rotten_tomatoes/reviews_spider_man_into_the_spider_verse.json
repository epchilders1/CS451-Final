    "text": "Art. \n\nIn this age of endless animated movie releases from the multi-million dollar big studio production to the straight to streaming budget slop I can see why so many people think of cartoons as simply a child's medium.\n\nBut animation when done right is Art. Art that can invoke emotion and leave you breathless. Though this movie needs to be a comic book origin movie the WAY they decide to approach it when it would have been SO MUCH EASIER to make it \"just a cartoon\" shows care, skill, and yes, artistry. \n\nThis movie had scenes that I would put on my wall, a story of growing into your destiny, of fathers and sons, all rolled up together with fun fight scenes and jokes and just plain fun.\n\nThis is my favorite Spider-Man movie. Even including the live action work that has come before and since this movie captures the essence of Spider-Man. There's so much more to say about it so just watch it for yourself.",

I had no idea that these stupid Spiderman Fanfiction-like characters that look like something I\u2019d draw for a project in elementary school would make me cry my eyes out. I have absolutely no critiques for this movie because it was absolutely perfect. Fun for kids, fun for teens, fun for adults, fun for seniors. Fun for everyone.",
