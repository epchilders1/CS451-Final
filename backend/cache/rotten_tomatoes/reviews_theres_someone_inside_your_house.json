    "text": "SPOILER WARNING: Definitely would not recommend this watch, I read the book before watching the movie and (the book) was absolutely amazing but the movie lacked in pretty much every aspect. There was poor acting, poorly written murders, also didn\u2019t try to match any of the characters to the descriptions written in the book (I know this is not always easy but it\u2019s like the only character they tried to match with the book was Makani). Also they added the part where Ollie did a background check making him seem like a bad guy when she revealed this later on in the book.",

    "text": "\"There's Someone Inside Your House\" is Netflix's venture into the slasher genre, and while it's easy to compare it to its more innovative predecessors, it carves its own path without relying on nostalgia.\n\nWhat I appreciated about this film is its commitment to doing things on its own terms. It doesn't try to be a parody or a throwback; instead, it stands on its own. The story is straightforward slasher fare\u2014teens getting picked off one by one\u2014but it has a charm that's hard to ignore, even if it feels like it's just rehashing familiar territory.\n\nThe film has its entertaining moments, though it doesn't entirely deliver on the scares or the drama. It's like a slightly stale cookie\u2014it might not be perfect, but it still satisfies a craving. The body count is lower than expected, and the tension doesn't always hit the mark, but it manages to keep things interesting enough.\n\nOne of the movie's strengths is its blend of style and substance. The kills are inventive, and there's enough suspense to keep you guessing until the end. However, it does struggle with character development and sometimes feels like it's ticking off boxes rather than creating a compelling narrative.\n\nUltimately, \"There's Someone Inside Your House\" is a decent addition to the slasher canon. It might not redefine the genre, but it provides enough thrills to make it worth a watch for fans. It's not the scariest or most original, but it has a certain appeal that makes it enjoyable.",

    "text": "This is a slightly above average film. It's like a cross between Saw (2004) and Scream (1996) but made in 2021. The characters and story aren't as memorable as Scream and the violence isn't as intense as Saw. The murderer wasn\u2019t who I thought it would be, which was good. The reasoning didn't really make sense. There are some really great sequences like driving into the fire and the phone torches at the party but there's also too much filler and it can be pretty slow moving at times. The concept can't fill the runtime. I did enjoy the slashing violence and gore. Worth watching if you can't think of anything else to watch.",
