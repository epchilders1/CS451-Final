But then, I look through Netflix and that seems to be almost everything coming out these days.  Action, post apocalypse, dystopian, blah, blah, blah. This one is slightly better in that the protagonist isn\u2019t immune to it, but I wish they\u2019d make more movies without all the blood and gore and with some intellect.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Gerard Butler repite en lo que mejor sabe hacer: un thriller de acci\u00f3n donde la l\u00f3gica pasa a un segundo plano. El piloto no pretende ser realista ni falta que le hace. Tiene escenas imposibles y situaciones que rozan lo absurdo, pero cumple con lo esencial: mantenerte atento durante casi dos horas con un ritmo \u00e1gil y varias secuencias potentes.\n\nEl verdadero punto fuerte est\u00e1 en Butler, que vuelve a demostrar por qu\u00e9 sigue funcionando como h\u00e9roe de acci\u00f3n a la vieja usanza. Junto a \u00e9l, Mike Colter aporta la solidez necesaria para que el d\u00fao mantenga el inter\u00e9s incluso cuando el guion se apoya en clich\u00e9s ya conocidos. La qu\u00edmica entre ambos logra elevar un material que, en otras manos, podr\u00eda haberse sentido mucho m\u00e1s plano.\n\nLa direcci\u00f3n de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet apuesta por una acci\u00f3n trepidante y clara, sin adornos innecesarios. Aunque algunas situaciones se resuelven de forma demasiado f\u00e1cil, el pulso narrativo es firme y consigue que el espectador no pierda nunca la atenci\u00f3n. Por momentos recuerda a aquellas pel\u00edculas de videoclub de los ochenta, donde lo importante era el espect\u00e1culo y no la credibilidad.\n\nAqu\u00ed no hay que buscar giros profundos ni grandes innovaciones. El piloto es cine de \"fast food\": r\u00e1pido, contundente y f\u00e1cil de olvidar, pero eficaz en lo que propone. Explosiones, peleas y suspense, con espacio de sobra para disfrutar sin complicaciones.\n\nEn definitiva, puede que no deje huella ni cambie la percepci\u00f3n del g\u00e9nero, pero consigue lo que se propone: ofrecer evasi\u00f3n y acci\u00f3n al estilo Butler. Y, en ese sentido, cumple con creces.\n\n(ENGLISH) Gerard Butler returns to what he does best: an action thriller where logic takes a back seat. The Pilot doesn\u2019t aim for realism, nor does it need to. It\u2019s full of impossible scenes and over-the-top moments, but it delivers on its promise: keeping you engaged for nearly two hours with a brisk pace and plenty of intense sequences.\n\nThe real strength lies in Butler, once again proving why he still works so well as an old-school action hero. Alongside him, Mike Colter brings the solidity needed to keep things interesting, even when the script leans on clich\u00e9s we\u2019ve seen countless times. Their chemistry elevates material that, in other hands, might have felt much flatter.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet directs with fast, straightforward action and no unnecessary frills. Some situations may resolve a bit too easily, but the narrative pulse is strong enough to never lose the viewer. At times, it recalls those 1980s video-club action flicks, where spectacle mattered more than credibility.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about deep twists or innovation. The Pilot is \"fast food\" cinema: quick, straightforward, easy to forget, but effective at what it offers. Explosions, fights, and suspense, with plenty of room for uncomplicated fun.\n\nUltimately, it may not leave a lasting mark or change perceptions of the genre, but it delivers what it sets out to: escapism and action, Butler-style. And in that sense, it works perfectly.",

The officer died mysteriously and the prisoner is chillen. The pilot didn't care much, like \"hey man lets get this action movie rolling\". Come on into the woods with me and ill walk ahead of ya completely trusting. lol I had a hard time with this one, its been 15 years but i doubt an IRL pilot isn't suspicious about the cop being dead. Gerard Butler is a picture perfect pilot is about the top of the 2 stars. Well he did have a firearm, i guess i can see the situational perspective besides for Gerard being known as a badazz.",

Aviation law requires pilots to be in control of the aircraft during such conditions. \nThe film fails to capture the insurance and legal implications of such actions and instead takes a turn for a sub-par action plot.
