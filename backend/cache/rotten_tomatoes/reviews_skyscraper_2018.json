The problem is that the movie is just kind of boring and I never really got into the characters and felt invested. I think Dwayne Johnson is fine in the lead role and he fits in well for a wacky action movie like this. I think if the movie was trimmed down to maybe about 80 minutes and more focused on the action and mayhem, there is something more entertaining possible here. Overall, as it stands, it is just a forgettable action movie that doesn't really justify itself when you could just rewatch \"Die Hard\" instead.",
