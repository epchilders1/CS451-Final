ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY between ANY OF THE ACTORS. Vaughn is the only one who pulls it off, and just barely. Conclusion, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS DIRECTOR SUCKS.",

They don't make them like these anymore. This is astonishing slow-burning craftmanship at all levels, especially director and writer CRAIG ZAHLER. What a film !! !! !!",

Due to its slow build up, I was primed for something awesome to bring it all home. That never occurred but they did include some over the top gratuitous gore so if that's your thing maybe you'll enjoy. Too bad too, mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn could've been a great duo",

This one took it's time but in a way that made it enjoyable, Almost like it would be in real life= real time. Dialogue was good. Vaughn is awesome, so was mel. Story was pretty cool. \nA keeper and worth your time.",

    "text": "A story which can be fully described within 1hr but \"dragged us across the concrete\" for 2.5hrs. Sometimes, slow storytelling is good. But in this case, I just cannot understand why I'm staring at the actors sitting in a car for almost 10 minutes and basically have done nothing. I don't know where the antagonists came from, what's their name and how did they managed to pull off their goals. This movie literally taught me that if you see the same \"hightlight\" clip on YouTube or TikTok again and again, then it might be a terrible movie or TV show. Also the movie showed us how a bank employee didn't want to go to work and begging her husband for opening the door, only for touching her child once more before she leaves. This clip wasted 3 more minutes and for what? Letting us know her husband have made a bad decision? Or just how important this person is? I couldn't see any of that. Maybe the director wanted to make this movie looks lika a real-life tempo. But movie is movie, I didn't came to the theater to watch somebody's vlog footages.",
