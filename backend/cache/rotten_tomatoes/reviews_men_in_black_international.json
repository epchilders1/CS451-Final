It\u2019s hard to place why I didn\u2019t like it more as it had excellent production quality and on paper much more potential than the direct sequels to the original. Sadly I found it very forgettable and pretty much the same level of enjoyment and engagement as the previous sequels but it should be better. I liked the casting but the only character I liked was Molly. The villains were cool. I don\u2019t know, it just didn\u2019t come together somehow.",

    "text": "While superficially similar to MiB 1-3, in fact it's lightyears away from them.\nIt's simply missing almost everything that made those ones vastly enjoyable: the creative firework, the tons of jokes that go beyond the usual, the believable humanity of its lead characters, the ability to constantly surprise the viewer; and, perhaps most of all, the deep irony that hangs above the whole thing and makes the viewers smile half of the movie time. \nInstead, this is a lazy movie that opts to fall back to cardboard leads and well known, worn-out Hollywood cliches. It tells a story the audience has seen a hundred times already, ending up as predictable and, despite the action, somewhat boring even. Ultimately this is a movie that displays Hollywood\u2019s stringent technical professionalism in many ways, only it lacks the inspiration to give it an actual soul.",

Smith turned it down, especially now that he's proved himself to be so incredibly unlikeable. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel that connects both the USA and London branches in some way. But I'd imagine we're more likely to see a reboot.",

There is no story arch for the lead character Tessa Thompson who plays agent M is one of the least likeable and believable characters in any film , she for no reason and with no training knows everything and can beat and outsmart agents who presumably have work for MIB for years .
