Great acting and I wish I had what it takes to be a NYAD but uplifting as it is we can't all achieve her greatness. Grab all the motivation you can from this and live another day",

    "text": "Nyad is a beautifully told adventure drama about  courage, achievement, aging, and friendship. The stars, Annette Benning and Jodie Foster, both give awards-worthy performances as Diana Nyad and her coach, respectively. Netflix is great at finding classic dramas with a modern twist and this true story of a World Record achievement really works. \u201cEveryone should feel like the star of their own life,\u201d says Diana Nyad, whose goal of swimming from Cuba to Florida was an \u201cimpossible\u201d dream that she turned into reality. If you want to take a moment to feel inspired, then see this film!",

Mas o \u00fanico desafio que n\u00e3o conseguiu foi nadar de Cuba a Florida. S\u00e3o 160 Km em mar aberto, mas isso depois de 30 anos. Ele tenta quando esta 61, 62, 63 e quando estava com 64 anos consegue, quando todos n\u00e3o acreditava mais nela, e por causa das adversidades e da idade. Mas a sua determina\u00e7\u00e3o e concluir esta miss\u00e3o, proposito de vida fez ela vencer, o mar, \u00e1guas marinhas, sol, tempestade os amigos, a t\u00e9cnica, e a si pr\u00f3pria. \nRoteiro e enredo de perseveran\u00e7a. Lembrando que temos Jodie Foster e Annette Bening.\nVale apena assistir? sim\nNota: 6",

    "text": "Nyad avoids (most of) the typical clich\u00e9s that accompany athlete biopics. At two hours and a singular minute, it is well-paced and, as someone who knew nothing about Diana Nyad\u2019s (Annette Bening) story, provided a plot with scintillations and concerns \u2014 if she couldn\u2019t do it at 30, how would she do it in her 60s? Annette Bening plays the protagonist as someone monomaniacally driven and pretty shitty to those around her, even if she couldn\u2019t accomplish the feat without their assistance. If swimming in shark and box jellyfish-infested waters from Havana to Key West isn\u2019t enough, Nyad recounts sexual abuse she endured as a teen when a jellyfish smashes her in the face. Unfortunately, the film suffers from this common trope wherein the remarkable, death-defying stunt isn\u2019t enough and we must include adolescent trauma. Her story is uplifting, even if the authorities at be have questioned the legitimacy of her accomplishments. Jodie Foster, as her long-time friend and coach, and Bening have the chemistry you\u2019d expect from that sort of lengthy, even beleaguered, relationship. While I don\u2019t think it will win anything at the Oscars, its nominations (Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress) got me to watch and review it and I can definitely recommend Nyad for not diverting from the core of what an athlete biopic should be.",

Quiz\u00e1s el ritmo es un poco lento al inicio pero es necesario para ir asentando la historia y la forma en la que la misma Nyad estaba llevando su vida, tambi\u00e9n fue interesante como fueron mostrando el abuso de su ni\u00f1ez con breves im\u00e1genes y relatos que no romp\u00edan con el ritmo de la historia.",

I'm a sports fan, but somehow the story didn't really grab my interest/emotions.\n\nGiven the portrayal of Ms. Nyad as somewhat psychologically \"absorbed\", it is a bit surprising that the movie brings forward her claims against former coach (& long deceased) Jack Nelson. In a quick search I did not find any support for the movie's representation that multiple former swimmers had made claims against Nelson. I do not mean to proclaim Nelson's innocence or say that that Ms. Nyad's allegation is untrue.",
