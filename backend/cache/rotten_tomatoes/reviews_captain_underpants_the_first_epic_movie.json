I also especially like how this movie takes a kind of stale plot and makes something great out of it, especially considering the source material is about a naked middle aged man defeating potty humor named villains. Well done DreamWorks \ud83d\udc4f",

It\u2019s one of those movies that make you want to stay in your seat all the way through. \n\nIn conclusion the Captain Underpants movie is a child friendly movie that fun to watch no matter your age.",
