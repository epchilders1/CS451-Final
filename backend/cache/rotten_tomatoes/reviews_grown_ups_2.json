But, there are a lot of likable and comedic actors here. They're all having fun on screen together so it can be a good time. The movie is telling so many jokes that there are inevitably a few that land. It's pretty dumb, but isn't that kind of the whole point?",

From the bus driver and the fake toilet in Kmart (\u201cGet out of me!\u201d) to the rock quarry jump where Kevin James lands on David Spade (\u201cI was inside you\u201d), it\u2019s just wall-to-wall ridiculousness. It\u2019s the kind of movie you watch with friends when you want to laugh at dumb jokes, awkward moments, and people doing stuff you\u2019d never get away with in real life. I love all Adam sandler movies, I could watch it a hundred times and still crack up every single time.",

The jokes are really plank with the college and parents jokes is just terrible and the movie comedy has nothing to offer unless you just like the characters like the first movie has a great cast but other then that is just doesn\u2019t offer anything. 2/10 some jokes would give a chuckle but nothing else",
