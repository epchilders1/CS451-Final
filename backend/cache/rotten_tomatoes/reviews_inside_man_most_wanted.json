    "text": "Inside Man is one of my favorite Spike Lee films, it had a standout performance by Denzel Washington, a cast that included Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, William Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor who were all very good, great directing, great writing, great screenplay, great cinematography, and one hell of a great musical score, if you want to make a great bank heist movie, get Spike Lee to direct it for you, i\u2019m just going to pretend that Inside Man doesn\u2019t exist, terrible directing, terrible acting, terrible screenplay, actor AML Ameen seemed  to be channeling Will Smith trying to do a Denzel Washington imitation, it just didn\u2019t work, Ameen seems like a good actor, but not in this movie, I soldiered through this movie, trying to find something to like about it but honestly, I couldn\u2019t find a thing",

    "text": "I watched only 10 minutes before switching it off. I expected an A-level film but quickly realized this was more of a B-movie at best. From the start, the acting and directing were poor.\n\nThe plot involves armed robbers taking over a bank, but the lead female gunman looked completely unconvincing\u2014dragging her weapon like a paperweight and delivering a weakly executed Eastern European accent. It was hard to take the threat seriously.\n\nThe opening scene with Remy Darbonne, a police negotiator, was equally unconvincing. He\u2019s trying to de-escalate a hostage situation in a hospital where a man, frustrated by steep medical bills, holds a nurse at knifepoint. Oddly, the director places another nurse hiding behind a medical box across the room\u2014as if she were also in imminent danger. But the attacker only has a knife and is far away. That detail felt forced and unnecessary.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get past the poor execution and quickly lost interest.",

And, please, where did they get Roxanne McKee from? What a horrible actress! \nWhat a regrettable experience.",

No intrigue like the original.  Cast is mediocre, some ok performances from Aml Amen and Rhea Seehorn. But it\u2019s a pale shadow of the movie from 2006. That cast and crew from Spike Lee\u2019s 2006 production: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and the rest of the cast was really good. I\u2019d recommend you check that one out and skip this poor sequel.",
