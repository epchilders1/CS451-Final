The acting writing and directing our all equally abominable.\n\nNot sure if the actors in this movie ever considered taking acting lessons, but they are sorely needed across the board. The writing is horrendous and the directing is pedantic. Don\u2019t waste your time on this movie. There\u2019s plenty of other things on Netflix to watch.\n\nI am absolutely flummoxed as to how this movie ever made it to the Netflix platform.",

The bad acting, the horrible decision making of the lead (girl, if you follow someone into the middle of nowhere and park in the yard by their house behind a tree, in reality they\u2019re gonna see you), and the ridiculous overacting of the kids- it\u2019s just bad. Save yourself some time, and don\u2019t watch.",

I downloaded it for a plane ride, meaning I didn't have alternatives, but I honestly wish I could surgically remove it from my brain. Horrible writing, acting, plot, characters, cinematography, etc. I can't think of a single strength. It was just wretched in every imaginable way. \n\nWhoever is responsible for this atrocity should be banned from the film industry for life. Save yourselves and watch LITERALLY ANYTHING else.",

This film managed to infuriate me with its relentless overuse of fade-to-black transitions, which felt less like artistic choices and more like editing malpractice. And then there was that scene: the one where the camera crew is clearly visible. Seriously? How does an entire production team miss something so glaring? It\u2019s 2024\u2014we should be well past this level of amateurism. The only thing taken in plain sight was two hours of my life\u2026 and not even Liam Neeson showed up to save them. 1/10",

The story line made no sense and there was no emotion behind any of the characters. Spoiler: the mom finds the kid. When they\u2019re reunited, they hug for maybe 10 seconds. The kid was missing for 6 months. If I don\u2019t see my dog for a day, I give him a longer hug once we\u2019re together again. I can\u2019t say enough bad things about this movie. I think I\u2019ll never stop thinking about how terrible it was. Suddenly, I want to become an actor because I know I could do so much better. -948284736448/10. Don\u2019t watch.",
