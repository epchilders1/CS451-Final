    "text": "Mean Girls is a movie that conveys a message and prompts reflection on female rivalry. \nIt tells the story of a girl who lived in Africa and was homeschooled, then moved to Canada and started attending a school with a very strong social hierarchy. The leader? Regina George, who has her trio and is very conceited. The main character, played by Lindsay Lohan, becomes obsessed with popularity. The film features various back-and-forth conflicts that culminate in the two fighting and being looked down upon by their classmates.\nMean Girls is a classic of American cinema, and although it is very entertaining and maximalist, it says a lot about how our society works",

    "text": "Quite a funny film with a lot of really good passing comedic moments that might not always be intrinsic to the plot but enhance the viewing experience a great deal. Unfortunately, it can't resist the easy way out, i.e. the resolution of the conflicts between the characters is rather lacking in its brevity and simplicity, thus letting down the rest of the movie. But other than that, it's an enjoyable, vivacious and consistent depiction of character dynamics, and its confidence is captivating.",

    "text": "I've been on a bit of a romcom streak lately. As I've watched them, I've noticed that there are some teen romcoms that are quotable (\"She's the Man\"), some that are classics (\"Clueless\") and some that have a ridiculous premise that kind of works (\"She's All That\"). In each of these cases, there are pieces of greatness but all of them are lacking in one area: a strong screenplay. Tina Fey's script for \"Mean Girls\" is one of the best comedy scripts that I've ever read and it has an instantly recognizable tone from the first scene.\n\nThis movie delivers on many different levels, from the iconic characters to the witty cutaways. With a strong premise at the forefront and great performances all around, I honestly believe that \"Mean Girls\" is the best teen romcom of the last 30 years and one of the best of all time.\n\nBest Character: Regina George\nBest Quote: \"She doesn't even go here!\" - Damian\nBest Scene: The Trust Falls",
