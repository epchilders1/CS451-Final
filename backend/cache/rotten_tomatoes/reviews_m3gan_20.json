    "text": "It reminds me of Alien/Aliens or the Invisible Man Series where it changes genres after starting in Horror. So that's not an inherently bad thing and shows the creative direction you can take something. I'm all for that...this though does too much of it. I will say the cinematography isn't bad here and is an improvement over the first. The lighting, neo neon backgrounds, and more creative settings in general make it far more memorable. The action scenes are ridiculously over the top and none of it is partiucarly memorable. But it does pop more than the first. The editing is half decent and everything else is alright. This is a straight action Sci-Fi movie with almost no horror in it at all. The problem here though is this is way too overstuffed/bloated. It tries fitting in an arc for M3GAN, the returning characters, and a save the world secret agent, spy thriller, 007, Sci-Fi action movie plot filled with so many twists and turns and over the top moments that it's ridiculous. You can't even keep track honestly the more it goes what is happening and who double crosses who or what AI is doing what and who is working for who. You legit need to draw a flow chart. It's the biggest strike of the film honestly. Than the returning characters are just as one note as the frist and the dialouge is filled with too much plot expose that tries explaining this ridiuclous story. Half the lines I swear are explaining stuff rather than focusing on personal growth. Which DOES happen here but it's weighed down by the ridicoulous plot, a bloated script, plot expose, and too much over the top moments and some lingering acting problems from the first. It has lots of commentary on AI in general but it feels like it gets completely lost. Skip this. It's not really terrible at all and the action makes it never boring but it's hard to follow and doesn't ahve really any of the things that made the first work better.",

It's a fun movie, and has a few solid messages to it. It's not a horror movie, and some people will be upset about that, but if you go into it to just watch a movie instead of watching for the first M3gan, you'll have a good time.",

    "text": "I have no problems with the genre shift. It worked for Alien and The Terminator. Hell, it's not like the actionised sequel trope stopped some films from making money and sometimes it\u2019s nice for a sequel to do something different rather than just turn M3GAN into Robo-Chucky. I do think the first film was better and the actual action is fairly standard and something that the director could improve on in a later film but I still think 2.0 was entertaining. It does have some good, if unsubtle, things to say about technology, the story does feel like a natural continuation of the first film, the titular character's actions aren't swept under the rug like some other IPs do when their villains pull a Heel-Face Turn and she does go through some good development. It even has a few funny moments, if not to the same satirical levels as its predecessor. I think Jason Blum was being a bit too harsh when it came to discussing this film bombing. M3GAN 2.0 might be a bit overlong and needed some refining, pacing-wise, but I still had fun with \"Terminator 2 for girls\", and I don't mean that disparagingly.",

    "text": "M3GAN 2.0 (2025)\nDeserved a Better Screenplay\n(12,047\u2013 08 Nov 2025 \u2013 by Claudio Carvalho)\nSomewhere between Iran and Turkey, the powerful robot AMELIA (Ivanna Sakhno), who was built based on M3GAN technology, invades an enemy hideout to rescue a scientist. Agent Sattler (Timm Sharp), who works with technology, shows her performance in real time in the Pentagon. Out of the blue, instead of saving the scientist, AMELIA executes him and Sattler realizes that he does not control her. Meanwhile, Gemma (Allison Williams) runs a small company of technology with her partners Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez) and Tess (Jen Van Epps) and is promoting an AI Regulation with the cybersecurity expert Christian (Aristotle Athari) after writing a book. She still lives with her fourteen-year-old niece Cady (Violet McGraw), who is a nerd that studies computer science. When Sattler and his agents break into her house expecting to know whether Gemma is involved in AMELIA\u2019s project, M3GAN (Amie Donald) shows up to her since she made a back up in Gemma\u2019s smart home. She offers help to stop AMELIA, provided Gamma gives her a physical body. Gemma lures her and builds a harmless Teletubby Robot body, and they team up to stop AMELIA. But it is not an easy task since AMELIA is more powerful than ever.\n\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d (2025) is a sequel that deserved a better screenplay, since the plot is messy and most of the characters are obnoxious or stupid. The action and the CGI are excellent, but most of the jokes are not funny. The story is confusing, and the twists do not work well. It is a pity, since it could have been a great sequel. My vote is eight.\nTitle (Brazil): \u201cM3gan 2.0\u201d\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",
