I enjoy the humor and mystery with only slight elements of darkness and violence that are integral to the plot. Overall though this is a very entertaining movie.",

It's pretty opposite in tone and style to Glass Onion, so if that's your favorite one, you might not prefer this one, but I like how each movie has a different vibe. Great reveals, nice acting! I hope to see more movies in this franchise!",

The attempts at humor fell flat and I never really felt connected to any of the characters. This film could have and should have been shaved down to 90 minutes instead of almost 2 and a half hours.",

This movie differed from the first two movies as it focused more on the two main characters as opposed to the cast as a whole. I thought it had a nice mix of humor, suspense, and had the \"Whodunnit\" factor.",

    "text": "To clarify: I am not religious, but was raised Catholic and know cursory things about the priesthood. There are charming moments in this movie. Some good performances. But the script is so bad, guys. How did this guy even become a priest? Literally: killing someone is automatic nonstarter to becoming ordained \u2014 an actual rule. And he\u2019s like this naive Everyman, but there is no way on Earth this guy would be a priest in NY. It is wildly difficult, time-consuming, so much eduction and discernment required. It was a plot device that didn\u2019t stand up to the slightest scrutiny. There are so, so many holes in this story besides. I found myself rolling my eyes on several occasions, and I LOVED the first two movies. So many loose threads that they didn\u2019t bother addressing even with the silly-long runtime. You have to suspend so much disbelief to just enjoy the movie, which is a big turnoff for me. I\u2019ll overlook a lot for a good movie. But the foundations here are way too thin and shaky for the convoluted mess they tried to build atop.",

Stronger in its setting and themes this time around. Craig and O'Connor have an incredible chemistry together. The majority of the side characters are fairly weak and the wrap up isn't fully satisfying. As long as Johnson and Craig are willing this series can never end.",
