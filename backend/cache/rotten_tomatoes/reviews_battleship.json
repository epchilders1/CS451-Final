Don't worry, the plot holes provide ample ventilation to prevent being asphyxiated by the the Three Stooges silliness.\n   Your eyes will get a workout...might even cause dizziness from rolling them for 2 hours. \n   You really have to \"be in a mood\" to finish this one. Good luck!",

Once we get into the crux of the fighting it all goes horribly downhill. By the close you\u2019re just desperate for it to all end. The ending is woeful too. It really is a bad film with some surprising cast members having cameos.",

Yes, the plot is quite two dimensional, but the point of it is to enjoy the amazing special effects and action - with a tiny homage to the original boardgame in the bouy scene! Besides, it does a wonderful job incorporating real veterans into the story and cast, showing that when it matters most they are always willing and ready to serve.",
