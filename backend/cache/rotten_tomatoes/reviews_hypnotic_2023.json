    "text": "Matrix Vibes Minus the Magic, But Bloody Entertaining All the Same:\n\n\nBlimey, Hypnotic had me proper gripped from the off, like a dodgy pint that sneaks up on you - echoing the mind-melting chases of The Matrix but without that Wachowski wizardry to truly elevate it.\n\nBen Affleck's grizzled copper is a right tormented soul, and Alice Braga brings a spark of saucy intrigue that keeps the pulse racing. Robert Rodriguez zips through this 93-minute lark at breakneck speed, no faffing about with drags, just snappy twists that had me second-guessing every shadow.\n\nIt's engaging as you like, a solid 7/10 for sheer escapism, though something's missing - that elusive spark to turn good into great - and the predictability nips at its heels despite the curveballs. Can't fathom the dismal ratings; perhaps the critics were hypnotised into gloom?\n\nFor a rainy eve's popcorn fodder, it's a cheeky winner that left me chuffed. Fancy a reality tweak? Dive in, lads.",

I will happily watch a lot of B movie sci-fi but this one was just a little too meh. It was fine but I won't rewatch it.",

Completamente diferente a todo lo que se puede haber contado antes y a la vez familiar en algunas formas. Hynotic nos cuenta una historia que parece inveros\u00edmil que resulte al principio pero lo hace y lo logra con un buen ritmo, giros inesperados en los lugares precisos, excelentes actuaciones, gran direcci\u00f3n, efectos visuales en la dosis justa y un poco de coraz\u00f3n. Destinada a ser un cl\u00e1sico de culto desde su concepci\u00f3n, habr\u00e1 gente que la ame y que la desprecie pero esta claro que desapercibido no pasa para nadie que la vea.",
