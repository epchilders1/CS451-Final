Mason Gooding is not a good villain he just looks like a kid model who was thrown into a role that he doesn't believe in. Dylan Sprouse is like a young Paul Walker, but he's got no charisma. This should have been a Tubi or Freevee movie.",

I feel there better choices could have been better for the rogue captain. The one positive from this movie is that Dylan Sprouse deserves a lot of credit as well as future rolls within the action movie genre.",

    "text": "***Misunderstood Villain, Misjudged Film***\n\n(Potential spoilers \u2013 character detail discussed, not plot twists)\n\nMost of the criticism I\u2019m seeing around Aftermath focuses on the villain being \u201coveracted,\u201d but I genuinely think people are missing the deeper character construction. This isn\u2019t a sleek, calculated action villain\u2014it\u2019s a man who is dying, traumatised, and mentally unraveling. That\u2019s intentional.\n\nThe antagonist openly says he has a golf-ball-sized brain tumour and is on anticancer medication\u2014known to affect cognition, mood, and behaviour. He\u2019s not chaotic for shock value; he\u2019s terminal, heavily medicated, and dealing with long-term trauma. His emotional outbursts and erratic behaviour reflect that. It\u2019s not bad acting\u2014it\u2019s one of the most grounded portrayals of a man with nothing left to lose that I\u2019ve seen in recent action thrillers.\n\nMany viewers seem to expect a \u201cMarvel-style\u201d villain\u2014cool, composed, and quippy. That\u2019s not who this character is. He\u2019s dangerous because he\u2019s unpredictable, emotionally raw, and mentally unstable. That\u2019s what makes him compelling\u2014and terrifying.\n\nDylan Sprouse delivers a solid performance as the lead, and while the plot has a few clunky moments, the film holds real tension and an emotional throughline that sets it apart. If you actually engage with the character motivations, Aftermath becomes a lot more meaningful than most reviews suggest.",

    "text": "Aftermath (2024)\nGood Action Movie, but with Awful Storyline, Screenplay, Dialogs and Villain\n(11,780 \u2013 22 Jun 2025 \u2013 by Claudio Carvalho)\nIn Boston, the former Army Ranger Eric Matthews Daniels (Dylan Sprouse) is giving driving lesson to his sixteen-year-old Madeline \u201cMaddie\u201d Daniels (Megan Stott) in his truck. While crossing the Tobin Memorial Bridge, the police is transporting the prisoner Samantha \u201cDoc\u201d Brown in an armored truck to testify against her former Retcon Squad for killing several civilians in Afghanistan. Out of the blue, a group of terrorists led by Jimmy 'Romeo' Roken (Mason Gooding), blow up the bridge in two halves. The he uses the hostages to force the government to release the \"Shattered Dove initiative\", where the squad was authorized to kill civilians in certain circumstances and release the Retcon soldiers. But Eric, who suffers from PTSD, wants to save Maddie from the terrorists, begins a resistance on the bridge killing terrorists. When Doc flees from the armored truck, they team up to save the hostages.\n\u201cAftermath\u201d (2024) is a good action movie directed by Patrick Lussier. However, the awful storyline, screenplay and dialogs by Nathan Graham Davis and the villain Jimmy 'Romeo' Roken destroy the movie. Mason Gooding has one of the worst performances ever seen. The rest of the cast is very reasonable, the special effects are good, but the senseless situation associated with the performance of Mason Gooding makes the film almost unbearable. My vote is five.\nTitle (Brazil): \u201cRef\u00e9ns na Ponte\u201d (\u201chostages on the Bridge\u201d)\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",

There are a few good moments, but mainly it's all too predictable. The main good scene is the final rescue idea! One can while away those 90 minutes if one has nothing else to do. 4/10 points.",

The plot had the makings of being a really good action movie but we were left not \u201cfeeling it\u201d. Honestly I think Sprouse did well his script could\u2019ve been better in spots but overall he made the movie not a complete flop. I\u2019m kind of thinking the main villain his acting felt too forced and the script didn\u2019t do him any justice.",

Any of these experiences will be infinitely more pleasurable than watching this total failure of a movie. Those who have commented that the script must have been written by an 8-year old just deeply insulted 8-year olds all over the world. Startlingly bad writing, direction and acting. The special effects were the most competently done aspect of this flick, and even they were cheesy. Did I mention that sitting on a railroad spike would be more fun\u2026",
