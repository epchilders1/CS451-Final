    "text": "A truly dreadful film and I can\u2019t help feeling Ridley Scott was having a trip when he wrote it. Where Gladiator was terrifically scripted with an excellent cast, well filmed and with one of the best music scores I can imagine, GladiatorII is the opposite in every way. The storyline struggles to hold itself and the casting is actually funny in its lunacy. Nothing rings true: in particular Washington is awful and the casting of Matt Lucas is just bizarre. Some scenes are just nuts - sharks in a flooded Colosseum??? A massive miss. I have just watched it in full having given up after 30 minutes last time but still nothing works. A total flop. Don\u2019t waste your time!",

Similar characters, similar storyline, similar lines. The acting isn't great, and my main issue is the characters are so 2 dimensional, it's hard to care about any of them.",

    "text": "Denzel Washington is an all time great, but he works best in modern gangster style roles like Training Day, Equalizer, or Man on Fire. Dropping him into Gladiator 2 just did not work. His style, presence, and delivery all feel too modern for the Roman world, and instead of blending in he becomes a distraction.\n\nThe film tries to present a gritty, authentic Roman environment, and then in every scene he feels completely disconnected from the world around him. It breaks the immersion and makes the story feel less believable. It is not about his acting ability at all. It is the casting choice. He simply does not match the tone, culture, or atmosphere of the setting, and the contrast is obvious every time he appears.",

Feel like they could have made a awesome Gil, specially because of the actors they had.",

The writers missed capturing the essence of what made the first film interesting - historical drama based in history. \n\nPaul Mescal is good, but never mustered the same presence as Russell Crowe, and the Denzel character seemed hollow and never developed due to the screen time dedicated to the fatuous duo dunce Emperors. \n\nI absolutely recommend a watch, if only to pay homage to the first landmark film, and the fantastic VFX rendered by the crews in this one.",
