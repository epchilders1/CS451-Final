    "text": "This film should have been titled \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Boring \u201c\nAn endless parade of heavily made up mature women displaying bizarre fashions with handsome men surprisingly interested in them, it reminds me of the love comics that my mother read in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s.\nThe script is trite and banal and the screenplay doesn\u2019t fulfill the plot.\nHowever, menopausal women with neutered husbands will probably find it lovely.",

While this latest film in the series does not really offer anything new, it still makes for a worthwhile pass time thanks to some of its colourful characters and interesting filming locations.",

    "text": "I watched this movie with anticipation, expecting a compelling narrative. Regrettably, it lacked clear direction, leaving me unimpressed. Despite a talented cast \u2013 boasting impressive past performances \u2013 the film failed to deliver.\n\nThe actors showcased their expertise, but their collective effort couldn't overcome the story's shortcomings. A meandering plot and lack of focus squandered the movie's potential.\n\nWith a tighter script and clearer vision, this film could have excelled. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it. As it stands, it's a missed opportunity.",
