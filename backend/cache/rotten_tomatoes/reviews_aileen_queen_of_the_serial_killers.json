She called herself a serial killer\u2013I don't think she quite is, she didn't torture or sexually humiliate her victims. I wish she had not had such a rough life, and instead had done something positive for society. That was not her lot, though.",

That one friend Dawn mentioned briefly a bad childhood but no real details, just vague. They didn't talk about how she got into prostitution. They didn't talk about the killings themselves. They didn't really show anything at all.",

    "text": "Spellbinding to watch someone so personable yet damaged and capable of these murders. I can see why total strangers were drawn to her. Bizarre the lady who said God wanted her to become her mother. She was so friendly and lively - great actor because it was easy to believe she wouldn't commit these murders. Is this how a psychopath comes across I wondered. The implications was her mental health meant she murdered because she had been raped and hurt by men. This may our may not be true.  The movie was well done but I would have liked to hear more about the victims. They were murdered so it felt like their lives could have been respected a bit more.  The only real part that did that was when Aileen apologised to their families.",

    "text": "Aileen: Queen of the Serial Killers is a documentary series that attempts to explore the life and crimes of Aileen Wuornos, positioning her as one of the most notorious female killers in history. While her actions were undeniably horrific and tragic, the series seems to overstate her notoriety compared to figures like Ted Bundy, which can come across as sensationalized rather than informative.\n\nThe documentary does highlight the gravity of her crimes and the impact on her victims, but the overall presentation feels awkward and flat. It struggles to engage the viewer meaningfully, lacking the depth and nuance necessary for a subject of such complexity. The narrative sometimes feels forced, and the pacing makes it difficult to fully absorb the story or form a coherent understanding of her life and motivations.\n\nOne notable issue is that the series blurs sensationalism with fact, leaving the viewer questioning the credibility of certain elements. It doesn\u2019t always feel grounded, which can diminish the seriousness of the subject matter. The interviews and reenactments, while intended to add perspective, often feel disjointed or awkwardly staged.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, there is value in documenting her crimes to ensure that the victims\u2019 stories are acknowledged and remembered. However, the execution of this series doesn\u2019t fully respect the gravity of the real-life events, and the overemphasis on Wuornos as a \"queen of killers\" undermines the impact of the material.\n\nIn the end, while the documentary sheds some light on her life and crimes, it\u2019s ultimately a poorly constructed and uneven series. Those seeking a compelling, well-crafted true crime exploration may find themselves disappointed, as it fails to deliver a fully credible or engaging narrative.",

    "text": "This is an excellent documentary about Aileen.  At the very beginning of the show some man was commenting how disgusting that she was and how any man could be attracted to her. A lot of men who frequent prostitutes are far more disgusting than any prostitute! And also she is a lot better looking than many prostitutes that I have known, and no I am not one of those ever, but they have regulars that like them and will do things that others will not or they do get attached to them. I think it is also ridiculous how fast they executed her compared to male serial killers, even those who asked for the death penalty like she did. Discrimination? I think so.   I'm watching the Netflix documentary and now I find out that one of the men that she killed had a history of violence against women and they had a lot more to say about him, but of course she is a woman, so she deserves less mercy.\ud83e\udd2c. I'm so glad that those people adopted her as her daughter and that she accepted Christ as her Lord and savior!! \ud83d\ude4f",

Not enough was said about the victims or how they were murdered, and the narrative leans in Aileens favour from the get go. This documentary wants you to feel sorry for Aileen.",

One woman adopts her, another is star struck, and all marvel how she has found God. Was the Producers intention to make us admire her? Didn't work. She is a manipulative cold hearted monster. What's next? A heartfelt portrayal of Gacy?",

    "text": "There was a lot of fantastic footage in this documentary, but I think it did some damage by not having a more nuanced approach and clearer point of view. At best it revealed how the system that prosecuted her was just after a conviction, not justice and added to the abuse she experienced in her live. BUT she did do these crimes and would've ended up in prison either way. And overall it was just muddled.\n\nThis would have been much better as a 3 or 4 part limited series, one focusing on her childhood and background, which here they just skimmed over after the promise of a deep dive. And the effects of abuse. Another focusing on the crimes and the victims, which was also skimmed over. Another on how her background might have contributed to her mental health issues and how it influenced her crimes and how they think the girlfriend influenced her, implied in the show but not addressed. Then one focusing on the judicial process she went through - and what it should have been, what evidence they had, how they found her. And talk about what the outcome could've looked like if it was prosecuted more ethically.",

    "text": "Clearly the documentary creator wants the viewer to sympathize with Wuornos or at least recognize some underlying issues like sexual abuse in the background and work of many sex workers, and the criminal justice system's biases against them, or just bias in favor of convictions over the full truth (not investigating the violent background of the first victim Richard Mallory was clearly negligent). But, there was plenty of time to cover the points hammered on repetitively and also look a bit more into what really happened in the killings after the first one or two. It seems extremely unlikely all were killed while attacking Wuornos, and Wuornos admits in the documentary she just 'wasted' one of them for telling her, she claims, he was a drug dealer. Other sources say Wuornos went back on those 'final truth' statements again later on, but this documentary doesn't even tell what Wuornos said at all about the 4th-6th cases, plus no consideration whether there might have been others. It's as if doesn't matter what the truth of the killings was, only the bad hand Ailleen Wuornos was dealt in life.",

Aileen Wuornos murdered seven men, yet the film skims over six of them with zero detail\u2014one brief trial anecdote, that\u2019s it. Instead, we get a pity parade: abusive childhood, \u201cshe was actually sweet,\u201d blah blah. She killed seven people. A full quarter of the runtime is the director gazing into the void, chain-smoking, and monologuing about her own feelings. Exploitative, shallow, and insultingly soft on a serial killer.",

But trying to get some understanding of her actions by interviewing her old friend and Aileen herself, did not really give me any more understanding into why she became a serial killer.  Aileen herself said she had a good decent upbringing with her grandparents, so why does she choose to hit the road with little education at 15?  She had a job as a waitress earlier where people can make a living, but she chose hitchhiking prostitution as her career and it messed her up good",
