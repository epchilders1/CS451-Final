    "text": "I read this book when I was in grade 7 and I LOVED it. When I heard they were making a movie, I was beyond excited and I couldn\u2019t wait. I thought it was taking forever to release because they were making sure it was an appealing and accurate movie compared to the book. Absolutely not. I was extremely disappointed. I waited 4 years for this and I walked away wishing they either left Uglies as a book or actually took the time to at least have decent CGI.",

    "text": "Uglies \u00e8 un film che mi ha sorpreso in positivo per atmosfera, effetti visivi e per la tematica centrale, semplice ma allo stesso tempo molto importante. Il messaggio di fondo funziona, e durante tutto il film ero davvero coinvolto.\nPurtroppo per\u00f2 il finale rovina completamente l\u2019esperienza: \u00e8 tronco, incompleto e lascia tutto in sospeso senza una vera conclusione.\nNonostante gli elementi positivi, non posso consigliarlo perch\u00e9 d\u00e0 la sensazione di essere solo \u2018met\u00e0 film\u2019. Il finale \u00e8 talmente deludente che compromette tutto il resto.",

I personally think they did well in the adaptation, which is no small feat. It's a spectacular movie. Nothing about Joey King us ugly though. \n\nI've watched the movie multiple times now. I hope we get a movie based of Pretties.",

    "text": "Whilst I can only award this 1 and 1/2 stars for the shallow (no irony intended) storyline, slightly strange concepts and lack of an engaging story lines or characterisation, I can't claim to have completely not-enjoyed this film and I would watch a second if there was one to be released. So, if you find yourself needing what I categorise as an 'evening filler', this wouldn't be the more terrible choice you would be making... as long as you understand that it's just that, a good movie to fill a lazy Sunday evening with and could be followed along with whilst also completing the laundry, or cooking etc.",

    "text": "Really bad movie.  Obviously made for middle schoolers.  Seemed very low budget.  The script was so infantile. We couldn't through 20 minutes, before we decided to fast forward to see how it ended.  Also the attempt at positive messages was ridiculous, especially since the \"Lady\" who was supposed to be the face of \"beauty\" was a man dressed like a lady!  Those scenes were especially unwatchable.  Do not waste your time.",

This movie is not just a bad investment of your time, but bad in general. The special effects will be the only things to keep your eyes from falling asleep, not because they are good, because they are too overly flashy... risk of seisure, not for the faint of heart. The plot is so foreseeable, the comunication between the characters is so weak it seemed for me that not only it is a teen movie, but it is made by a teen.",

The pacing is something I want to get at most I get it\u2019s a short runtime but Joey King\u2019s character literally killed Keith Power\u2019s character\u2019s parents and then he\u2019s just supposed to forgive her and still trust her enough to try the \u201cantidote\u201d on her in the supposed sequel that I hope never comes out.",

And lowkey tally and shay together as welll, but have to admit, trope seems very similar to hunger games within the love triangle that\u2019s sort of going on but I do really want David and tally to meet again. Really really want a second movie OMGGG",
