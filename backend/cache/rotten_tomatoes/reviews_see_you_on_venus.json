The events seemed to come out of no where and then be resolved within a minute. I wish there was more story development and showing of emotions rather than trying to cram a lot into a few minutes.",

To appreciate it, you need to put yourself in the role of a young girl who has lived her life not knowing her mom and going from foster home to foster home. I don\u2019t want to give you the details of the movie, but it will make you feel good",

If you seek action films or steamy sex this file is not the choice. See You on Venus is more like curling up with a satisfying if not exactly memorable book. No regrets investing the time to watch.",

    "text": "Such a touching story, profound and full of important messages. It leaves you with many questions about the way we live our lifes and what's the meaning of being here. It's visible to me that  its writer is someone with a sensitivity and talent that has yet to be discovered and honored in cinema. Since her novel in which this film is inspired is working so well and has a depth and dimension I rarely find in others... I'm really looking forward to seeing her next works. I enjoyed watching See you on Venus and loved the charisma and tenderness Virginia Gardner brings to her character, cause is close to M\u00eda from the book. Thanks for creating such a lovely story.",

    "text": "This is a movie with a deep message that I also enjoyed after reading the original novel written by Victoria Vinuesa. I loved to watch how the characters open up about their true worries in a different, loving and totally truthful way that I have never seem till now in a movie. Some of my beliefs, regarding life after death and how much loved we truly are, completely changed. Mia is a character that helped me to question myself, as after seeing her deep love for humanity and her true worries about our indifferent behaviour, I couldn't resist to question myself in that way too. With no doubt I recommend watching the film and also reading the book.",

    "text": "I read the book last summer and I'm still moved by the depths of the message, the preciously detailed story, bursting with pure, luminous love and with a great sense of humor too. Victoria Vinuesa is a 10/10 writer! Hope to see more of her work on the screen really soon. An unmissable voice with personality, a profound knowledge, and the talent to make you immerse in the story, to make you laugh and cry, to make you feel alive and to make you realize that someone beautiful out there is listening, that you are not alone: and it feels absolutely peaceful and lovely. It'd been years since I last read a book in 3 days. Although the production didn't seem to totally capture the deepness of the script/novel, I totally recommend watching this film, cause, truly, I believe Vinuesa's voice is an outstanding voice.",
