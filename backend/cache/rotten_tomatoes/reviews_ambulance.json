While it delivers action and strong performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Eiza Gonzalez, the whole thing seems to play like a trailer.  Ambulance would have benefited from a more measured pace and should have slowed down a little at times in order to develop the characters.",

    "text": "Michael Bay\u2019s Ambulance is one of those action thrillers that grabs you from the opening moments and refuses to let go, delivering a relentless two-hour ride driven by chaos, desperation, and tightly wound character dynamics. What makes the film immediately stand out is the surprising emotional current running beneath the explosions and Bay-isms. Instead of relying solely on spectacle, the story uses tension, anxiety, and human stakes to elevate what could have been a standard heist-gone-wrong narrative. The film wastes no time setting its frantic pace, and the intensity practically becomes a character of its own.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is the standout force, turning in one of his most energetic and unhinged performances in years. He grounds his character in charisma, unpredictability, and a sense of manic urgency that pushes the film forward. Opposite him, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II delivers a more restrained and heartfelt performance, creating a dynamic that feels both volatile and deeply personal. Their chemistry is exactly what the movie needs: a push-and-pull relationship that never stops shifting, keeping the audience unsure who to trust or root for at any given moment.\n\nThe direction is undeniably Bay\u2014fast cuts, sweeping drone shots, loud sound design\u2014but in Ambulance, those stylistic choices work better than they have in years. Bay uses the confined space of the ambulance to build claustrophobia while balancing it with massive city-wide chase sequences that turn Los Angeles into a kinetic playground. There\u2019s a rhythm to the chaos, and even when the visuals become overwhelming, they maintain a clear purpose: heightening the desperation of the characters who are spiraling further out of control.\n\nThe screenplay, however, occasionally struggles to keep up with the film\u2019s energy. There are moments where the dialogue stumbles or the pacing becomes uneven, and certain plot points feel more convoluted than necessary. But even when the narrative wavers, it recovers quickly thanks to the film\u2019s sheer commitment to momentum. The twists and turns don\u2019t always land cleanly, yet they consistently keep the audience guessing about who\u2019s making which decision and how the situation could possibly escalate further.\n\nWhat ultimately makes Ambulance work is how fully it embraces its own intensity. The film is unapologetically loud, chaotic, and sometimes messy, but it never pretends to be anything else. The heart of the story\u2014loyalty, desperation, and moral conflict\u2014remains strong enough to give the action weight. Whether the characters are arguing, panicking, or fighting for survival, the film always pulls viewers directly into their uncertainty and adrenaline.\n\nAs wild as it is, Ambulance succeeds at being a thrilling, surprisingly engaging action film with big performances, sharp direction, and a sense of urgency that rarely lets up. It may have its flaws, and at times the story bounces so quickly that it borders on disorienting, but the overall experience is undeniably entertaining. For viewers craving a high-energy, tension-soaked ride with standout acting and bold stylistic choices, this is absolutely a film worth watching.",
