My music taste is the turbo soundrack. I have lost count of how many times i have watched this movie but since ive watched it everyday 5 times since it came out is suspect in somewhere in the bilions, yes i did the math. My life has gone more than up since i watched this movie, quite frankly my life STARTED when i watched this for the first time. Everytime i see a snail in real life i scream WOW THAT SNAIL IS FAST and begin crying all over the place because it reminds me of the thing that makes me truly happy... Turbo 2013",

    "text": "This seems to be the best animated movie about racing.\n\nThe concept is very distinctive: a snail (snails tend to be slow) who wants/dreams to be the fastest racer yet. And he left, dodging what was going to hold him back & catches attention with bigger friends who truly believe in him.\n\nI was very keen on the casting: Ryan Reynolds portraying Theo/Turbo (who is often portraying the outspoken protagonist who is easy at making you laugh (i.e: Deadpool)). And Guy Gagm\u00e9 was like no other animated role that Bill Hader has ever had.\n\nAnd another meaning is that \"you should not always meet your heroes in person\" when Theo/Turbo was inspired by Guy Gagm\u00e9 who said \"No dream is too big, no dreamer is too small\". Then, Guy Gagm\u00e9 turns be the narcissistic antagonist who never thought about others being successful & win all the time - he turned out not believe in the snail.\n\nThis is truly better than Pixar's Cars or Disney's Wreck-it-Ralph. DreamWorks is the best.",
