Although predictable, the tone was creepy  and dramatic enough to keep you on edge.  It\u2019s worth your time",

It just got so slow near the middle when he\u2019d already committed all the murders, you think \u201cwell, I guess now we are getting close to the end of the film. Not much else they can do right?\u201d WRONG! 50 minutes left. This would have been a great tv movie with an hour twenty runtime. 3/5 stars.",

    "text": "\u201cYou think you know somebody\u201d, a deceived line that became a basic foundation for plotting suspenseful thrillers \u2013 to a particular heightened extent \u2013 whereas the protagonist must grapple acquainted senses towards another\u2019s swift malevolence. Alfred Hitchcock certainly characterized around that very saying while occasionally placing a macguffin that traces connective malicious intents to the now-weary protagonist who must tread carefully, and survive, in preventing the spree from going further. With that in mind, filmmakers seem to have acknowledged the formulaic effect with enough grounded realism to immerse and captivate viewers into the structural dimension akin to how it would occur situationally. There was that kind of potential over the factual coverage for \u201cThe Good Nurse\u201d, but it seems instead your ordinary showcase that excels rather than thinking inspired creativity.\n\nWhat truly intrigues how much the narrative is lesser known despite the subtle notoriety undermining the medical industry to go into contractual silence just to protect their trustworthy integrity. The film acts as a crime thriller in a differential environment you wouldn\u2019t expect to occur then built as a platform to scathingly remember the circumstances that question ethics (amid sporadic criticism towards the very industry), and the surrounding artistic license jointly aims to assist in forming a grasp of the leaning themes. As indicated, this film is based on a true story about a nurse named Charles Cullen, thoughtful and empathetic approachably upfront but questionable when suspicions arise in the events of many patients\u2019 mysteriously sudden deaths when put under his care (the paperwork afterwords were filled cautiously and unethically by his supervisors to avoid scandal). The method he\u2019d used was injecting another dangerous chemical into the IV bags, prepped to replace the emptied usage for the patient\u2019s continuous treatment, whether or not initially prognosed to make it through. He\u2019s been doing that for 16 years across multiple hospitals he kept moving to, before eventually fired over trivial reasons, but the actual push is rightful suspicions the heads couldn\u2019t handle anymore. His later confession\u2019s snide remark states that they never stopped him. He\u2019s currently serving 18 life sentences, from confirming many identified deaths, per cleared memory, amounted at double-digit that could go high as 400 patients he\u2019d killed under the radar.\n\nCullen\u2019s serial killer spree was driven by his own mental instability, no matter how basically experienced and knowledgably educated he is in the field that maintained his employment from one hospital to another. Those who haven\u2019t seen the headlines, probably due to buried history but not forgotten to prevent from ever repeating, are nonetheless lured to this true crime story promisingly thrilling, till Cullen\u2019s complexity evokes one\u2019s own glancing at the facts regarding his life story to decrypt his psychoanalysis. (Although, much of this might\u2019ve gotten covered in the complemented documentary \u201cCapturing the Killer Nurse\u201d). Who finally saw through him was Amy Loughren, a single mother and compassionate nurse who struggled the demanding night shift in the ICU trying to build up her eligibility for health insurance to cover her life-threatening heart disease, which she kept disclosed from her peers. When Charles entered the picture, not only did he lighten her load but the two developed a strong friendship as she trusts him with her condition in secret whilst becoming her life\u2019s main support. But once the mysterious deaths set off an investigation that points out Charles as the main suspect, Amy at first readily defended his innocence till a shocking find forced her to risk her life and her children\u2019s safety to uncover the truth in two-folded secret.\n\nStraight-forward in factual deliverance that manage to thrill at a minimum under impeccable dramatization to slightly be taken as character study if not equipped with background information that insisted imperative depth. Between expectations and how it turned out, the proper form director Tobias Lindholm should\u2019ve taken when helming the story to visual life is actually considering Hitchcock\u2019s approach that could replicate the weighing atmosphere to suspense over studious caution. Perhaps just obtaining background information midway through duration must\u2019ve damped the given structural narrative, but anyone already aware of the story would observe against speculation and/or memory akin to being informatively equipped either way that opened up what could suggestively make it all the more authentic. Lindholm arguably did just that but to lesser convincing with zero shock value when leaning towards the obvious. Are we seeking to see how the story unfolds or to find any sort of thrills justified? This could also suggest how factually-based coverages with lingering sensations become noteworthy adaptations to be approached differently than coasting on existing facts related to being spoiled. Besides, Lindholm actually did replicate another renowned endeavor in his 2015\u2019s \u201cA War\u201d after Stanley Kramer\u2019s \u201cPath to Glory\u201d. Score composed by Biosphere and Jody Lee Lips\u2019 observative cinematography backs up the chills when decently built by Krysty Wilson-Carins\u2019 somewhat subpar screenplay.\n\nEddie Redmayne\u2019s ever remarkable talent in embodying ranges of heavy desires with eccentric calmness as his charm did the most diving in embracing his troubled character with stunning ascendence. And Jessica Chastain has a credible stature to match Amy\u2019s humane compassion and conflict so perfectly that it puts us in a vulnerable grip. The agreeably well-matched pair outstandingly leads the film\u2019s uncertain flow of events, alongside Nnamdi Asomugha\u2019s provocation in challenging the (medical) industry\u2019s problematic ethics which further show how nuanced the reactivities are as they lend their own criticism. Those affected hospitals will forever be haunted by how they should\u2019ve handled then actually addressed those concerns rather than worrying about their credibility due to a potentially unfathomable scandal that already made newly arrived patients uneased, especially unable to know what\u2019s next when departing those beds either physically or spiritually. \u201cThe Good Nurse\u201d excelled as a typical showcase with slightly chilling buildup whilst resurfacing a story to generally spread awareness to sharpen many appliable focuses, despite not also envisioning a more effective approach to mirror those flattened shocks.

    "text": "Chastain and Redmayne are very good in this and they carry the film. The real villain of the piece, though, is not Redmayne but the medical \"system\", which allows all the evil to carry on by just moving it along and making it someone else's problem. Alongside this, Chastain's character can't pay for (and so cannot have) her own life saving surgery. \nReflect on the fact that this is a true story. If there was ever an argument for the NHS, this is it.",

    "text": "\"The Good Nurse\" is a film portraying the life of real life serial killer Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), who is one of the most prolific serial killers of all time. Suspected of killing up to 400 patients during his sixteen years of practice, nurse Cullen is a quiet, awkward nurse who arrives at the hospital ward of fellow nurse Amy (Jessica Chastain). At first he is incredibly helpful to her and her kids, but after a suspicious death of a patient, local law enforcement becomes involved. With their hands bound by red tape and litigious hospital administrators, two intrepid major crimes detectives (Nnamdi Asomugha & Noah Emmerich) dig for the truth. It is only with the help of nurse Amy that they finally uncover the truth, not only of nurse Cullen's horrific crimes, but of the series of hospitals that negligently suppressed their suspicions and quietly released him, allowing him to continue his spree for years.\n\nOverall, those who are familiar with the case ahead of seeing this movie will be entertained, as it adds some emotional backdrop to the tapestry of events that take place within this film. If you are unfamiliar with the backstory it may have less of an effect, but is still worth watching due to the superb acting and cinematography, although the dialogue is a bit stilted at times. I rate this movie 3.5 stars and would definitely recommend this film, however there is no need to rush this to the top of the list. Still, it is definitely worth a watch.",
