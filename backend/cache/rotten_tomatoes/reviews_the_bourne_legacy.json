Didn\u2019t miss Matt Damon one bit and that\u2019s a tall order for sure. Fight sequences were of perfection and quite believable. Was so impressed with this movie and don\u2019t understand why it got such low ratings.. should be in the 80s though I\u2019d give it in the 90s or higher. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Jeremy is actually a more \"believable\" agent than Matt who does an excellent job himself. The usually \"Bourne movies\" high speed chase is thrilling. I would enjoy seeing another movie from this pair of actors. Don't believe the haters and give this movie a chance with an open mind and just know going in that Jeremy is not trying to play Matt's role but is creating a new character.",

    "text": "5 years after the closure of the original trilogy, from Hollywood \u201cHeavens\u201d, Tony Gilroy, the screenwriter working on the franchise, newbie career as Director, comes The Bourne Legacy, solidifying the trend of bad naming of movie sequences. In 2025, and the knowledge that this film grossed abover estimated budget, we can say The Bourne Legacy was successful; but does it stand the test of time?\nIn this film, we only get Matt Damon through flashback scenes from the previous films, instead, lead actor Jeremy Renner plays Aaron Cross (foreshadow much?), an operative deemed dismissible after the events of The Bourne Ultimatum triggers a reaction chain that puts all Black Ops in dismay. \nThe plot is alright, but nothing new from the other entries in the franchise. I guess Legacy works more as a generic conspiracy movie, you could take out Jason Bourne out of the way and it still would have had the same plot points, for the most part.\nAnother detractor is that the chemistry from characters Aaron Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing just doesn\u2019t work. The story tries to use a lot of backstory romance to justify their subplot, but it flops. In the end, their story just feels forced, the unnatural woman in distrass falls in love by their sort-of captor. Weak.\nOverall, Legacy leaves actual bad history for the franchise, one that could just have been dismissed altogether. Without a strong premise other than just a character we don\u2019t care much trying to stay alive, The Bourne Legacy might work as a no-brainer Sunday movie, but fails as a driver for the franchise.",

Jeremy Renner does a fine job assuming the lead, and Rachel Weisz delivers a very believable performance. The idea that the spies in this film are physically and mentally enhanced through medical prowess adds an interesting and new element to the spy subgenre.",

    "text": "The Bourne Legacy is a surprisingly excellent and thoroughly entertaining film. Watching it now, more than a decade after its release, I was genuinely impressed\u2014especially given the unfairly harsh reviews it received at the time. The plot is solid, skillfully expanding the Bourne universe even without Matt Damon (which, honestly, works just fine). Jeremy Renner brings a compelling mix of strength, resourcefulness and grit to his character, while Rachel Weisz shines as a feminine yet smart and capable woman who rises to the challenge in her own way. The pacing is tight, the action well-executed\u2014I seriously loved this movie.",
