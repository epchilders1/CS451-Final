    "text": "The film is bad in every possible way. EVERY! They took a global bestseller and ruined it completely\u2014why? The many screenwriters are incompetent. The many producers even more so. And the only explanation for why the actors agreed to be in such a terrible script is money. Embarrassing. I can only warn you not to watch this poorly acted, poorly directed, and poorly produced film. (sooo many producers, unreal) Swiss cheese has fewer plot holes, and paint drying on the wall is more exciting to watch.",

    "text": "Filme: Postais Mortiferos\t\tAssistido: 19-8-24\nElenco: @jeffreydeanmorgan @famkefatale @cushjumbohere \nModelo: #policial #suspense\nDura\u00e7\u00e3o: 1h 44m\tAno: 2020\nMinha opini\u00e3o: Um filme policial com um serial Killer como em colecionador de Ossos, Seven, Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o,..... Neste filme temos Jacob (Jeffrey Dean) e Valerie (Famke Janssen) s\u00e3o um casal, quando a policia na Fran\u00e7a encotra sua filha morta com seu marido. E Jacob que \u00e9 detetive nos EUA, viajar para reconhecer o corpo. Neste drama, suspense. Ap\u00f3s reconhecer e perceber que a policia n\u00e3o tem nada e que n\u00e3o far\u00e3o mais nada ele come\u00e7a a investigar por si pr\u00f3prio. E para isso ele vai seguindo pistas eque o leva a outro pa\u00eds. At\u00e9 descobrir que na verdade existem outros casais que tamb\u00e9m foram mortos e que a forma como os cad\u00e1veres s\u00e3o postos, elas representam uma obra este estilo lembra o filme Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o que tamb\u00e9m recriava obras, porem de forma de arte ou Seven que era dos Sete Pecados Capitais. Lembrando que o casal foi abordado por um outro casal, onde fazem amizade. E o filme vai fazendo um paralelo com oque ocorreu com o casal jovem e o presente onde Jacob procura o assassino. At\u00e9 que o serial envia postais e que na verdade a cada assassinato parte dos corpos s\u00e3o usados e membros sendo colocado na cenado crime de forma aleat\u00f3ria a cada novo assassinato. At\u00e9 que Jacob descobre e consegue descobrir que na verdade o casal que imaginavam eram na verdade irm\u00e3os e que seu pai esta na pris\u00e3o. E que ele oprimia seus filhos com est\u00f3rias e levando a conhecer tudo sobre arte. E essa press\u00e3o causa neles dist\u00farbios que os transformam nesses assassinos e sem medo de morrer. At\u00e9 que se descobre tudo e que s\u00e3o rsponsaveis. Agora Jacob tem que salvar mais um casal da morte. E o casal pego. Assim Jacob consegue se vingar. Um filme que n\u00e3o deu a mesma liga que os outros aqui comentado. Um filme mediano, que n\u00e3o trouxe a mesma imers\u00e3o.\nRoteiro e enredo mediano. \nVale apena assistir? Se n\u00e3o tiver outra op\u00e7\u00e3o.\nNota: 5",

    "text": "I wish I had THAT two hours back......\nThe twist comes in the middle, when you discover that who you thought would be the \"KILLEES\" are actually the KILLERS.\n\nI'd normally be concerned that that's too big of a spoiler--but in the case of this boring thing that put me to sleep, I'll let it stand.\n\nIt devolves and turns into a one-dimension melodrama--and a fairly dull one, at that, once the mystery is removed.\n\nBesides, I just can't forgive Nagen for murdering Glenn. He'll always have some real retribution coming, in my book.",

    "text": "Incredibly frustrating mystery that only gets solved by convenient clues out of nowhere.\n\nDirector Danis Tanovi\u0107\u2019s crime mystery thriller The Postcard Killings (2020) is so stupid. It seems normal, but writers Liz Marklund and James Patterson just have random side characters talk to the detective with crucial information right at the end, so that he can figure out that the two killers are using pseudonyms. It even goes so far as to almost make a case for why incest should be normalized as a legitimate type of love. That is the villains\u2019 perspectives, so take that with a grain of salt, but The Postcard Killings is incredibly dumb.\n\nPatterson always leans into formulaic murder mystery fare, but this one gets increasingly ridiculous and nonsensical, that it ruins all the suspense from the first two thirds of the movie. It skips around too much and I could hardly follow what was happening or who anyone was talking about with the scattershot editing. The Postcard Killings is a textbook example of how not to do storytelling because it will confuse the audience.\n\nAmerican actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan is trying hard to be seriously invested and concerned as Jacob Kanon. Morgan is a great actor and has his compelling emotional moments here and adds some gravitas. However, he cannot entirely save a dull movie. He does nothing other than talk to a few investigators around Europe. Morgan must have gotten an easy vacation and paycheck for this because he\u2019s given surprisingly little to do to solve this case. Dutch actress Famke Janssen is unrecognizable as Valerie Kanon and randomly solves the murderers\u2019 backstories just on the side out of nowhere.\n\nBritish actress Cush Jumbo, yes that is her name, is so boring as journalist Dessie Lombard. She adds almost nothing here. German actor Joachim Kr\u00f3l is interesting and engaging opposite Morgan as German Inspector Klaus Bublitz. English actor Steven Mackintosh is equally engaging as English Inspector Rupert Pearce until he mostly disappears. English actress Naomi Battrick seems charming, then just does a Mia Goth impression as Sylvia Randolph to be more strange. Irish actor Ruairi O'Connor is pretty passive and forgettable as Mac Randolph. American actor Denis O'Hare is very creepy and irritable as Simon Haysmith.\n\nSwedish actress Eva R\u00f6se is gorgeous as the strict Swedish police Detective Agneta Hoglund. I loved her here like Morgan, but she hardly helps the investigation. Dutch actor Dylan Devonald Smith does what he can to appear creepy as the odd traveler man Pieter, who meets the main couple alongside Dutch actress Sallie Harmsen as Nienke.\n\nEditor Sean Barton cuts all over the place between countries, time, and people, so I was thoroughly confused when and where we were watching. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino shoots The Postcard Killings like an NCIS episode. Rocky Evans\u2019 lighting is standard with a bit of moody lighting and shadows here and there, but not enough for a dark crime mystery story like this one. Composer Simon Lacey\u2019s music is not eerie, nor exciting enough for this narrative. Nigel Egerton\u2019s costumes are very chic and modern at least.\n\nOverall, The Postcard Killings is not worth your time, not even as a fan of the cast or James Patterson\u2019s writing.",

Since a great deal of the action was in foreign countries I was initially afraid that much of the dialog would be interpreted, which can be distracting, but it was minimal and didn't detract from my attention.
