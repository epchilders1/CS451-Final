I know we used it to test how brave other kids were, as there were horrible stories of people seeing her face and getting scratched in the bathrooms. \nI really enjoyed this telling of the story as it was terrifying and had scary jump moments to it. \nGreat cast, great facial expressions they were able to carry throughout the film",

First time watching it, and honestly, it\u2019s not as terrible as the internet makes it out to be\u2014though it\u2019s definitely not good either. Linda Cardellini is hands-down the best thing here (she always elevates weak material), but the movie leans way too hard on cheap jump scares instead of actual tension. The plot is paper-thin, and the dialogue ranges from clunky to cringe-worthy. Still, it\u2019s oddly watchable in a \u201cdon\u2019t take it too seriously\u201d way. Overhated? Yep. Worth rewatching?

    "text": "The Curse of La Llorona isn\u2019t an outright disaster, but it definitely feels like the weakest link in the Conjuring universe. While the legend of La Llorona has plenty of chilling potential, the film leans so heavily on predictable jump scares that they stop being scary and start feeling like a cheap shortcut to tension. The atmosphere, set pieces, and characters never quite live up to the quality bar set by the other Conjuring films, leaving the whole thing feeling more like a rushed spinoff. There are a few genuinely eerie moments and strong performances sprinkled in, but they\u2019re buried under a barrage of loud sound cues and obvious setups.",

    "text": "The Curse of La Llorona (2019) \u2014 Let\u2019s not sugarcoat it: this isn\u2019t a great movie. But at the same time, it\u2019s not the absolute train wreck some people make it out to be. The biggest problem lies in the writing\u2014the script is scattered, uneven, and never fully leans into the folklore it\u2019s pulling from. The pacing feels a little off, like the movie doesn\u2019t quite know when to build tension and when to let it breathe. And yet, despite all of that, I still found myself watching it straight through without checking out completely. It\u2019s watchable, just not remarkable.\n\nThe real saving grace is the look and feel of the film. From a purely technical standpoint, The Curse of La Llorona actually delivers some impressive visuals. The cinematography is polished, atmospheric, and loaded with gloomy tones that fit the story\u2019s haunting roots. The direction leans into traditional jump scares, but the way those scares are framed is at least competent\u2014never groundbreaking, but cleanly executed in a way that makes you stick with it.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Linda Cardellini, who is without a doubt the film\u2019s anchor. She\u2019s an actress who consistently brings warmth and sincerity to her roles, and here, she gives a performance that\u2019s far better than the material she\u2019s working with. Without her, this film would have fallen apart completely. Cardellini grounds the story in a way that gives the audience something\u2014and someone\u2014to latch onto emotionally, even when the script itself doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing.\n\nThe problem is that the scares and the mythology never truly click together. La Llorona, as a figure in folklore, is genuinely terrifying and has the potential to carry a horror franchise. But the execution here is too paint-by-numbers, with the story moving from one predictable scare setup to the next without layering in enough depth. It never builds that overwhelming sense of dread that great horror thrives on. Instead, it feels like the film is just checking off boxes: creepy ghost in the shadows, sudden loud noise, another predictable haunting moment.\n\nSo where does that leave this movie? Somewhere right on the border. It\u2019s not \u201crotten\u201d in my book, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d rush to recommend either. It\u2019s a middle-of-the-road horror entry\u2014watchable for the visuals, serviceable for the scares, but forgettable overall. If you go in with low expectations, you might have a decent time, but if you\u2019re looking for something that lingers in your head long after the credits roll, this won\u2019t be it.\n\nThat said, I do think La Llorona as a character has potential if handled correctly. The legend is rich with horror possibilities, and with the right script and a director willing to take more risks, there\u2019s absolutely a foundation here for a terrifying sequel. Unfortunately, The Curse of La Llorona plays it too safe, and the result is a film that never rises above mediocrity.",

    "text": "More of a Whimper Than a Wail: A Soulless Take on a Terrifying Legend\nAs a Mexican-American, I grew up with the chilling tale of La Llorona\u2014the \"Wailing Woman\" whose mournful cries signal doom. The legend is a cornerstone of our folklore, rich with tragedy, maternal grief, and pure, primal terror. I went into The Curse of La Llorona with incredibly high hopes, eager to see this iconic specter given the terrifying big-screen treatment she deserves. What I got instead was a profoundly unimpressive and deeply disappointing film that felt more like a cheap parody than a genuine horror movie.\nThe most glaring issue is the plot, which is so formulaic and thin it\u2019s insulting. The film discards the deep psychological horror of the legend in favor of a paint-by-numbers haunting story. It follows a predictable sequence of jump scares that are loud but never frightening, and telegraphed so far in advance they lose all impact. There is no suspense, no building dread\u2014just a series of contrived set pieces that feel disconnected and emotionally hollow. The narrative could have been about any generic ghost, and swapping in La Llorona felt like a cynical marketing ploy rather than a story told with purpose.\nThe execution is further cheapened by sub-standard acting and a baffling lack of cultural authenticity. The performances are largely flat, with characters making nonsensical decisions that serve only to move them from one scare to the next. Even more jarring were the painfully fake Spanish accents, which were so distracting they completely shattered any hope of immersion. For anyone familiar with the culture, these elements don't just feel lazy; they feel disrespectful. It\u2019s a Hollywood caricature of a culture, rather than an honest engagement with it.\nUltimately, The Curse of La Llorona is a colossal missed opportunity. It takes a powerful, culturally significant ghost story and strips it of all its soul, nuance, and genuine terror. Instead of exploring the themes of loss, guilt, and feminine rage inherent in the legend, the film delivers a shallow, forgettable entry in the horror genre. This isn't the story of La Llorona I grew up fearing; this is a hollow echo, unworthy of the legend's name.",
