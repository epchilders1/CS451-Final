    "text": "I am a big fan of improv humor, when done correctly it can be some of the funniest reactions, because it is coming across 100% genuine. The guys from \"Whose Line is it Anyway?\" are the gold standard of improv comedy. Comedy is always a very subjective thing, and improv comedy is very hit or miss, but when it hits, it is hilarious. This movie had me howling in laughter several times throughout the film.\n\nThe actors in \"Whose Line\" are definitely more talented in improv, but the actors in Murderville's inability to do improv is part of the charm. There is an actor playing a dead body, and he can not keep a straight face while playing dead.\n\nAlong with being funny, the show is also a solid mystery. The audience gets all the necessary clues to solve the mystery in the show.\n\nI had a ton of fun with this movie, and if you are a fan of mysteries, comedies, Christmas and of course improv, I highly recommend this movie. Santa may have been killed, but I still had a very merry Christmas.",

    "text": "The premise and structure of \"Murderville\" may not be for everyone, but, if you're on board, \"Who Killed Santa?\" is particularly delightful.  Making the show \"smaller,\" with all of the action taking place essentially in one locale, helps focus the show, and the undeniable rapport between Arnett and Bateman is absolutely fantastic.  Maya Rudolph is also a lot of fun, as are a couple of other surprises that I won't spoil here.",
