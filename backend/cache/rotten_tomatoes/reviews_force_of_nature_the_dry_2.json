It is so bad that I actually feel sorry for Eric Bana.  I'm a huge loser who's accomplished nothing in life, yet I still feel bad for the guy.",

The way the Director, Bob Connelly, made the bush the main character is astonishing.\n\nA gripping story, kept me upto midnight, even though I have a bad cold. Visually compelling. \n\nDeborah-Lee Furness and Richard Roxborough are world class. Eric Bana holds up his end well. \n\nBe silly to miss it. Come on down, Dry3!",

Eric Bana and Anna Tove did the best they could considering the poor direction and script of this underwhelming movie.",

    "text": "Eric Bana torna nei panni del detective Falk in un'indagine che, esattamente come nel primo film, sfrutta molto bene le location, che diventano essenziali e centrali nello sviluppo di tutta la trama.\nLa sceneggiatura riesce abilmente a mantenere dubbio il finale e a nascondere i colpevoli sfruttando l'ampia gamma di personaggi per rendere il tutto pi\u00f9 imprevedibile e meno noioso.\nPurtroppo alcuni personaggi risultano un po' forzati nel dimostrare le loro (poche) caratteristiche finendo per essere poco spontanei e creando qualche crepa nei dialoghi.\nEric Bana invece continua sulla falsa riga del primo capitolo con un personaggio integerrimo e serio, senza grandi scatti emotivi che lo rendono molto interessante e perfino leggermente misterioso.\nPurtroppo il finale sulla cascata \u00e8 totalmente sbagliato, sia per credibilit\u00e0 della sceneggiatura che per la finta location trovata.\nComunque un giallo thriller ben costruito.",

While the actors did a great job, I guess I didn't really care for the characters or mystery?  The first film explored trauma, buried secrets, and the prisons we build for ourselves.

However, the storyline is just about some kind of desperate housewives arguing for stupid minor things that shouldn't have happened when a group entered life threatening situation. If the plot was more about deep secret in a slow burn pace, it would have brough the whole story to next level.",

Fantastically well rounded characters, it was so good.  The storyline was okay, hundreds not but the touch too long one on one conversations, at a goes some setting up the sun texts  it even the actual plot, but  the photography great, the sound effects/lighting really well done. Furness so tidy in her actions, subtle nuances that I really liked (except for the \u2018are we, Alice?\u2019 bit which you will understand once you\u2019ve been introduced beforehand to the Alice stuff/situation, Roxburgh and Bana just s good. The Aussie casualness of these characters was so enjoyable. Well done.",

The \u2018twists\u2019 and reveals came as no surprise because as I was watching it I thought there was no way they could twist this and make it interesting... and I was right.  The main chracter's involvement felt watered down and far less central to the plot than the predecessor, and the duality of the story did not mesh together as well as it did in the first film.  I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it all fits in to The Dry extended universe.",

An unfortunate mishap within a grand scheme that brings famous detective Falk into this Australian wilderness much damper than the previous instalment. Totally different circumstances but the conclusion is satisfactory could have been even better. Rich visuals of the greenery at last connects to Falks final statement of how nature reclaims no matter what we occupies our lives with all affairs are benath it. Great sound effects. Excellent performances by the cast. And this is another great instalment for Aaron Falk's adventures.",
