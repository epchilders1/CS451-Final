    "text": "These sex reversal films , just do not work . Atleast Mel Gibson , actually seemed like a man that most men could actually relate to in the film . In this film I really can't see many women relating to taraji's version of a woman . It more just loud brash rubbish. Cringing not funny . 1 thing men don't want is to watch this pile of rubbish.\nIt falls flat right from the beginning, and is torture every minute. I don't understand why these films are made. Next will be conana the barbarianess . It pathetic",

Efenist driven remakes fail to resonate, its the journey not just the win that makes a character great,",

No clever humour, banter and felt even offensive because the movie makers thought that we, the public are so stupid or simpleminded. I didn't finish it.",

There are lots of black actresses who are beautiful, but their beauty seems very white-adjacent with petite bodies and sharp features and straight hair.   The movie is a romcom, so not terribly deep, but I enjoyed it and recommend it for some light viewing.",
