    "text": "Review: The Secret Life of Pets (2016)\nReleased by Illumination Entertainment (not DreamWorks), The Secret Life of Pets is a charming animated feature that explores what our pets might be doing when we\u2019re not around. The story follows Max, a pampered house dog, and Duke, a scrappy stray who ends up at Max\u2019s home. After an unexpected turn of events, the two find themselves forced to work together\u2014despite their initial dislike for one another.\n\nThe film\u2019s concept is both clever and family-friendly, offering plenty of humor and heart. The animation is vibrant and well-executed, and the cityscapes are especially detailed and lively. The director kept the pacing tight and the story accessible for audiences of all ages.\n\nWhile some of the voice casting choices didn\u2019t entirely work for me\u2014certain voices felt mismatched with their characters\u2014I still found the film enjoyable overall. It\u2019s lighthearted, fun, and sets itself up nicely for future installments.\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets may not reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a delightful experience with just enough originality to stand out. A cute film worth watching, especially for families and animal lovers.",
