It's awful by The Emoji Movie standards. Who invented this movie. One of my least favourite movies. Don't watch this movie at all.",

    "text": "1 star is being too generous\nas a fan of the games I dint even knew what i was watching.\nfirst of the movie Doesn\u2019t adapt one single game. Instead, it takes set pieces (like the cargo plane scene from Uncharted 3) and treasure themes (pirate gold from Uncharted 4), then stitches them into a new \u201cfirst adventure\u201d story, and they add drama to make the movie interested like the Crush Nathan have for Chloe, and the way that Sam died not respecting the source material. The game is full of puzzles and mysteries and shooting, after all its not Nate that's after this treasure, but the movie doesn't even respect that. the personalities also have changed from the characters with made me love the series in the first place",

This is an entertaining movie to watch but it's full of writing flaws, a lot of lazy writing, the main characters always find a way out, the story is not very solid. It gets very expectable and boring at times. I wouldn't rewatch it",

The CGI is good, the acting is good, it\u2019s just that it is so incredibly boring and hard to follow. I tried to watch it multiple different times and it was so boring it\u2019s like my brain forgot it every time. It\u2019s honestly that bad. Sorry was really hoping it would be good:(",
