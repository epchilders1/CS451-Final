It was so fun at first, until they made this woman think and do nothing but want sex. This was clearly written by a man. There were some really fun moments and ideas that were all ruined by her obnoxious, overacted, over-the-top bedroom antics.",

Silly at times and not really clean writing, but watchable. If you have a strange sense of humor, this will fit the bill. Enjoyed it in a type of uneasy way?, perhaps ...",

It was so funny that I found myself laughing out loud at some scenes. Toni Collette did a great job together with Monica Bellucci. I never imagined that I would have so much fun watching a comedy mafia flick. If you are up to date with you mafia movies, then this is a must watch for you.",

The plot and the dialogues were so funny, Toni Colette\u2019s performance was amazing, she\u2019s effortlessly funny and her humor was on point.  The movie is reminiscent of the old Stephan Chow comedies.",

The scenery and sets made me want to look around the room or the scene more than watch the actors - one ultra-violent scene was so out-of-place over-the-top gory that it seemed completely out of synch with the otherwise light \u201ccomedy\u201d of errors\u2026 it wasn\u2019t funny enough to be a comedy, the acting wasn\u2019t good enough to make it a good mafia movie - notably bad in almost every way.

Yes, it was ridiculous but Toni Colette and the actors held it down and we stayed till the end. If you're in need of comedic fun and don't mind an outlandish plot, watch it. I recommend it.",
