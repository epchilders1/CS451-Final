Hats off to Sydney and Glen for carrying this movie effortlessly.\n\nThroughout the whole movie, I just kept thinking, \u201cplease just get together already!\u201d\n\nOverall, a heartfelt and fun movie that makes me want to find my person \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd7a",

While the film is predictable and clunky, the charm of its leads makes for a fun and watchable romp.\n\n\nAnyone but You is a fun and enjoyable romantic comedy that succeeds despite its weak script, thanks to the charisma of its leads. It's a solid watch for fans of old-school romantic escapism.",
