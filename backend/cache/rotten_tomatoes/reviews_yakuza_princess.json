You could edit 20 minutes without losing much or, better still, do something interesting. It seemed like there were too many writers pulling in different directions. Okay though.",

It Dive bombed so much at the end, it felt like they ran out of budget, would've been a stronger Film if it was a Short vs a Feature.",

    "text": "Minha opini\u00e3o: Por ser um filme creio meio brasileiro irei dar um a mais. Por passar no #bairrodaliberdade um dos meus prefiridos aqui em S\u00e3o Paulo. \u00c9 claro que deram um tapa na cara e modificaram o bairro, mostrando ser um bairro bohemio e cheio de mafiosos. A atriz Masumi, nunca havia a visto antes, creio ter feito uma interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o mediana, mas nas lutas ela mandou bem, tanto com a katana (espada). O ator Jonathan tamb\u00e9m fez um papel legal, mostrou mais express\u00e3o e sua maquiagem muito bem feita. O ator japon\u00eas Ihara deve gostar do Brasil, pois j\u00e1 havia feito outro filme aqui no Brasil \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Sujo\" que fala do conflito entre os pr\u00f3prios imigrantes japoneses aqui no Brasil que tiveram conflito com at\u00e9 mortes. Fato real daqueles que acreditavam que o Jap\u00e3o ganhou a guerra e daqueles que acreditavam no oposto (recomendo assistirem). Eu creio a melhor interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o entre os atores no filme. As sequencias de lutas no bra\u00e7o e na espada, me surpreenderam por ser um filme feito aqui no Brasil (parab\u00e9ns). O filme conta sobre uma guerra de cl\u00e3s da #yakuza no Jap\u00e3o. Onde uma fac\u00e7\u00e3o mata outra e nisso sobrevive apenas a fiha pequena em que o \"av\u00f4\" a leva para o Brasil. At\u00e9 que descobrem a exist\u00eancia dela a yakuza vem para elimina-la. E onde aparece o anjo da guarda Ihara e Jonathan com perda de memoria tamb\u00e9m a ajuda. E assim e a est\u00f3ria.\nRoteiro: O roteiro \u00e9 bom. Mas deixa a desejar partes da fala e cortes dos locais. Um filme tamb\u00e9m que passa a maior parte na noite, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 bem escuro.\nVale apena assistir? Sim, vale para prestigiar um filme que mandou bem. N\u00e3o \u00e9 aquelas coisas, mas vale assistir.\nNota: 7",

    "text": "Could've so easily been great had any one of the five writers actually created a screenplay that wasn't so choppy, derivative, incoherent, convoluted and riddled with plot and technical issues.\n\nIn the 111 min runtime, there was too much walking and talking with hardly any depth to the story or its characters. It had too much filler and very little substance. Many scenes were too long and/or unnecessary. Was this even edited? The scene transitions were horrible. And all that nonsense mystery didn't help the story either.\n\nWhat this film did have going for it, was decent cinematography, well choreographed fight scenes with awesome gore effects, and excellent performances. Considering this was MASUMI's first full length feature film - as a lead, with only three prior small T. V. roles, she nailed it, wow! I can't wait to see her in more action films, she's a natural. The location and production sets were on point, and the score was fitting and not overbearing as it usually is in many B films.\n\nHad this film been cut down to about 90 mins, with better editing and scene transitions, and more character development instead of all the filler, I may have given it an 8 or 9, but as is, it's only a generous 6/10 from me.",

Some sections use subtitles, but the movie was fun. The pacing may be slower than the typical Hollywood blockbuster, but it kept building all the way to the finale. A little bit gory, but to be expected based on the source material. Would actually like to see if again.",
