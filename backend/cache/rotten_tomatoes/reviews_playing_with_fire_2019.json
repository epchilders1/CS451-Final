    "text": "It does not want to take itself seriously.\n\nFrom the start, they make me seem to make me OK with the scene about a forest fire. I would also be attracted to it for John Leguizamo (Rodrigo) who is always being upbeat in comedy movies (no wonder Sid is my favourite character in Ice Age).\n\nThere are a few goofs in it.\n\nThe main focus is when they have to look after 3 siblings: Bryan, Will & Zoey. I do not believe that Brianna Hildebrand was a great actress in this but at least, being the oldest, is a role model knowing to look after younger siblings without any irritation on her.\n\nJohn Cena is Jake Carson, who seems to be sane & strict (similar to Ken from \"Bee Movie\") but he is funny & is told to have heart in it.\n\nOften, children in movies can be my favourite characters of the movie (the funniest ones) similar to Harry from \"Freaky Friday\". The best funniest part was when Will accidentally used paint thinner to clean the 4\u00d74, spills & causes a bubbly flood.\n\nThe other best moments were when they Brynn & Jake spoke about what happened to their parents \ud83e\udea6\ud83e\udea6. Obviously, they need emotional moments.\n\nAnother thing, anyone can be a Brony. They watched MLP, even Will & the firefighters were about it (especially Rodrigo). The firefighters/smokejumpers getting involved over MLP was adorable & funny (especially on Zoey's birthday) & about Axe & Pinky Pie.\n\nBut the scene between the birthday & the official ending was unnecessary.\n\nDo you think I am going to watch it again, like CWACOM 2?",

    "text": "Playing With Fire - 5/10. Saw this a long while back and I\u2019m surprised I never logged it in. Playing With Fire is John Cena\u2019s attempt at foraying into the family friendly film genre. All the big hulking action stars have done their part in trying to broaden their respective audiences with this type of career move. And though I would say out of all of them Schwarzenegger was the most successful, Cena\u2019s attempt in terms of acting is good, but the overall film is subpar. Playing With Fire feels like a tv movie of sorts, and it plays to a Disney channel level goofiness. Not saying that goofy is bad or not something you should attempt to do in comedy, but here, it just feels a little too childish. There\u2019s some hilarity that ensues with the situation, but overall, its a wacky tale that is designed for fans of Cena and for people that just want a non consequential film to watch!",

John Cena was super funny in this film, the rest of the cast was also laugh-on-the-floor funny! Keegan Michael Key and John Leguizamo never got old! The only thing I disliked was the poop jokes.",
