Being a Snitch would bring a lot more problems for your family then was depicted in this movie. I understand it was based on true events but, maybe they should read the paper and find out what happens to you and yours if you double cross the Juarez cartel. It's Hollywood I get it but for once I'd like them to show a little more realism and, a little less \"Hollywood\". Dwayne Johnson should stick to action movies I just couldn't buy him being a subdued father.",

I liked the movie enough to have watched it several times over the years...can't believe it's 9 years old at this point. Watched it today, and then bought the soundtrack.",

    "text": "Snitch is a fairly basic film about a father who will do anything to help his son. The idea of it is ridiculous at times, particularly in the way the District Attorney agrees to work with him. However, he formulates a plan to deal with the problem that is understandable, and creates a dramatic series of events in the climax. Dwayne Johnson instantly makes for a likeable protagonist, but this film doesn\u2019t capitalize on all his charisma. He isn\u2019t having fun at any point in this film, and that is not a great idea when you have a guy like The Rock starring in your movie. The other issue with the film is that people are meant to be a threat to Johnson, but he is such an intimidating presence that it\u2019s hard to see others as a danger. Susan Sarandon is perfect as the no-nonsense lawyer who is looking out for only herself and her job. I don\u2019t really get the Jon Bernthal thing, though, he\u2019s simply not all that engaging to me as an actor. I think at the core of Snitch there is a decent story, but it\u2019s not all that original or interesting. I was into the plot enough to watch through to the end and see how it would resolve, but it\u2019s nothing I need to watch again.",
