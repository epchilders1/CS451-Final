    "text": "Finally watching Leave the World Behind, and I\u2019m disappointed in myself for taking this long.\n\nSam Esmail (Mr. Robot, Leave the World Behind) is one of the very few film directors I\u2019d call a philosopher-auteur. The ideas he posits are not mere political commentary, extrapolated in some rote, overused, and mundane fashion, nor are they elaborate existential musings drawn from experience alone. Instead, his work is philosophically rigorous, seeking to unravel and locate the underpinnings of selfhood, the boundaries of the real, and the epistemological. Much like traditional philosophy, Esmail doesn\u2019t necessarily claim to have the answers; he is seeking truth through his work.\n\nThat said, as a movie, the film has some minor issues that undercuts its total potential.",

There were lots of moments that felt like you're watching a horror when it was a specific melody that was building something that must've end on the shocking plot twist but instead it was like \"Oh... and kinda nothing happens... But okay. The movie is not bad at all. I really enjoyed the acting. I would actually recommend to watch it. So instead of rewatching the millionth time \"Titanic\" you can dive into this. Because one thing that they have in common - is the length. I don't regret watching it. It's one of those movies that's really good to watch in the movie theater tho. The end gagged me.",

Blue/orange colour way, the lighting, long continuous shots, the tilted camera angles, ohhhhh I just can\u2019t get enough of it. You can tell every shot was considered. This movie just fills my soul with glee.",

Instead\u2026 it tucked me in like a grandma with chamomile tea.\n\nThis movie is such a complete waste of time that my brain literally said, \u201cNope,\u201d and powered itself off. I fell asleep mid-apocalypse. How do you mess that up? The world is ending and I\u2019m over here drooling on the pillow.\n\nIt keeps teasing big answers and big shocks, but then it\u2019s just\u2026 characters arguing about phone chargers and deer staring into the camera like they forgot their lines. Nothing pays off. Nothing gets explained. You keep waiting for the \u201cAha!\u201d moment \u2014 but the only thing that arrives is REM sleep.\n\nThe cast is amazing \u2014 Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, Mahershala Ali \u2014 all doing their best to act dramatic while absolutely nothing happens around them. It\u2019s like watching top-tier actors stuck in a loading screen.\n\nThat\u2019s why I officially rename it:\n\n\u201cLeave the World Behind: The Lullaby Edition.\u201d\nGuaranteed to cure insomnia better than melatonin.\n\nMovies are supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat, not knock you out colder than airplane mode.

Strong acting (Ali is a phenomenon but the entire case is very, very good), amazing camera work, expert pacing.\nSkillful play with viewers expectations and hideously tying several ways to create tension in a row.\nI do deduct half a star from an otherwise 5-star movie because the ending is too abrupt and leaves a lot of things unexplained.\nYes I know the movie's point is not the things that cause the collapse but how people react to it.\nBut I do want the story to make sense on the direct level (sorry).",

It seems that there was no set direction that the producers wanted to take it, so they threw everything they thought of into it at once. The ending was the worst and left so many open ended questions.",

Realistic arc of affluent characters from entitlement to humility as control over their individual circumstances slowly dissipates. There is no bow at the end of this one, folks, loose ends abound.

    "text": "Would love to give a good review. The ending of a movie is the most important part. Leaving the viewer on a cliffhanger just to \"open discussion\" is a terrible way to go about things with no plan to release a sequel. As a whole it's a okay movie. It leaves you asking questions, but questions you never get the answer to, in my opinion is an incomplete movie. 140 minutes of filler episodes from your favorite show is what it felt like. Guessing is one thing, but never receiving an answer just makes you feel like you wasted your time. Would love to see a sequel, but without one, I could never recommend this movie.",

There are a few scenes throughout the movie where you'd think this movie is about to go somewhere and it never does.   The positive takes is the acting is decent and the cinematography is good.   The tense music throughout the movie almost always leads to no where.  There's only questions throughout the entire movie and not in a thought provoking way.   I was desperately waiting for this movie to end.   I thought at this point any ending could help this movie until i saw the ending.   Quite possibly the worst ending in a movie, all time.   DO NOT WASTE 2 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES, This movie was garbage.",

Too many people expect a plot to be spoon-fed to them and every answer given, instead of using their critical thinking skills to connect the dots. It was wonderfully acted. The plot was suspenseful and interesting, and the ending was perfectly fine. I totally understand where they wanted you to go in terms of thinking for yourself. If you have half a brain, you could put two and two together and figure out what was gonna happen after the screen went black, you didn\u2019t need to see it.",
