    "text": "Trying to get past the first 5 minutes of this movie is a real chore for at least a couple of reasons. For starters, if you're on a motorized vehicle, like a motorcycle, a snowmobile, scooter, you crash and your helmet comes off, you'll most likely sustain a head injury. A properly secured helmet shouldn't come off... and if it does, so should your head. Second, even a half-a-moron is aware that you never remove an object with which you have been impaled for fear that one may bleed out. For the sake of realism, I'd have done just that and rolled the credits. This is just bad writing. 2 stars for the on-screen presence of Jean Reno.",

So, I started watching it, not only because of Jean Reno, but, because in the titles they are thanking Ukrainian film board, Ukrainian smth else, so I was thinking it will be related to Ukraine in some way.\nWhen I saw the mountains, I told myself \"Well, Carpatians\". Not, they told it's Washington state.\nThe guy (Reno) has in his house UKRAINIAN wool cover, and UKRAINIAN rug.Why ? It stays a mistery, hero of Reno is not Ukrainian. Nor he tries to seem a Ukrainian. Nothing in the movie is related to Ukraine in any sense.\nThe story is waste of time, I agree with others.\nI put 1 star and half for beautiful views only.",

After that, for one second it got very exciting, obviously it was the stepfather who wanted the girl dead, and the old friend of the girl was sent to \"end the job\".\nAfter that, nothing made sense. It became one of the worst movies I have seen.",

Ham acting, shoddy storyline, eclectic and inconsistent accents with no relevance or explanation, zero character development, and bizarrely suicidal approaches to assassination attempts. Jean Reno was the only saving grace - and that's perhaps because he'll always be the Professional.",

It\u2019s kind of like wine snobbery and it\u2019s ultimately not particularly valuable to the general public. \nThis is not a great movie but if you like a little action/drama and winterscapes, it\u2019s pretty legitimately entertaining. Remote location, captive, survival and the characters are believable and appealing. If you think too much, you won\u2019t find anything entertaining. I explore many different types of wine and I watch many different types of movies, I think this one\u2019s worth a visit.",

    "text": "It's not as bad as the ratings say.  I enjoyed watching it.  Story was OK, acting was good.  Problems were that it seemed to have run out of budget and the film ended prematurely.  It leaves a portion of the story hanging that was set up for another act, but the film just ended.  It was a French-Ukraine film, and it was kind of odd with all the actors speaking English, trying to sound American (set in Washington state but think it was filmed in Ukraine?) but most supporting actors had a slight strange accent.  The plot involving the main character ended in a way that didn't make sense to the character.  So some writing and an abrupt premature ending... otherwise I enjoyed it.",

Zero investment created, dialogue worse than a robocall might offer, and a general hollowness suggesting the worst of made for tv. Jean Reno, you have the cash!

The story is more jumbled than I'd like, but I enjoyed it. Anytime I can watch Jean Reno on screen I feel like it's a gift. He's just head and shoulders above most actors.  Sarah Lind does a good job as well.",
