    "text": "We decided to watch A Tourist\u2019s Guide to Love because Rachael Leigh Cook is in it. It was nice to see her again. This is a pretty standard romantic comedy, but it is also a video brochure for Vietnam tourism. The country the story is set in plays almost as big of a part as any of the cast. It does seem like a beautiful place. Even though there are some elements of the plot that don\u2019t make sense, some of the cast are better at acting than others, and it is easy to predict what is going to happen next, I still enjoyed watching A Tourist\u2019s Guide to Love (and not just because of Rachael Leigh Cook).",

The movie fails to have any redeeming quality.  Lack of chemistry between every single actor.  The writing is PAINFUL.  It's just another really dumb, canned \"romance\" movie where a jilted white woman goes overseas to learn fortune cookie wisdom from a local hunk and be submissively led along into 'finding herself.' Borderline racist.  Skip this tripe.",

The performances were believable, and the characters were likable, but the awkward dramatic pacing made it painful to watch.  The movie eventually found itself, but sadly, it just took too long.  I would have liked to see more emotional intensity at more critical points.",

Enjoy the beautiful cinematography and follow along with the lead character, even if the love story isn't quite rounded out.
