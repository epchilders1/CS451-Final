The actual footage of stand up parts confirms she's stupid and I can't believe she'd actually admit to this being based on anywhere like real events. Peasant woman's/man's Amy Schumer and that's being nice.",

This also did a good job at showing that the guy doesn\u2019t have to be traditionally abusive or mean to be a bad guy, nice guys who lie or do anything mundane are also bad. This also presented why women should be aware of guys with low esteem. LADIES WATCH THIS!!!",

Whatever this was trying to be, it turned out to be a really annoying bicker fest with an ending thats begging for a lawsuit. Not very well written, acted, or pretty much anything. Do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes of Seinfeld instead.",

    "text": "Good on Paper clearly depicts what being the victim of a master manipulator is like. What being in a false relationship is like. Lead actress Lisa Schlesinger knows all about it since the story is her own. I value this movie. It is a big lesson in protecting yourself from false people. A lesson in listening to that small voice warning you that things are getting weird. It supports trusting family and friends when they have hesitations about your significant other. \n\nWe have a tendency to look for the best in those we love. That's okay, except when a duplicitous person gets past our defenses and we are being manipulated into believing it is true love.\n\nYou don't want to be so critical that you miss out on a potentially good mate, but there are terrible people out there who come disguised as \"too good to be true\". That is what her best friends kept trying to tell her. He is too good to be true. \n\nThe acting by Lisa Schlesinger is great, and Ryan Hanson as boyfriend Dennis Kelly is also brilliant. He is so good at showing exactly what these awful people are like.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the overall framing of the story - the standup interjecting throughout the film. I also found Iliza to be quite likeable in this as the lead. A relatable character that connects to the audience. \nIn my opinion, the film lacked in its ability to tell a story in any real depth. The romantic development was weird\u2026 there was zero chemistry between them and then we're suddenly meant to believe they're in love. I was also confused by how deeply he was villainised in the film. It felt like a very one sided story being told, and it was lacking nuance. Even if the storyteller hates him, I believe there needs to be some room for the audience to decide how they feel for themselves. \nOverall, it wasn't a bad film but it just wasn't great.",
