Each of the actors in this film were excellent. This film moved me to tears, although there were many scenes that made me smile. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and I highly recommend it.",

I was rooting for Rob every step of the way. If you know the title of the book this film is based off of you know what happens. I did find it to drag on a bit and would have been a better, more clear, concise film if 20 minutes or so of time was cut. Overall a good watch.",

Blatant violation of speedy trial...?  And how would someone on jail not have access to medication and needed his son to pay for medication?  Ridiculous plot awful dramatization far from a true story",

    "text": "\"Rob Peace,\" a film that premiered in 2024, was one I regrettably missed in theaters, but I was able to catch it on Netflix. The movie features the talented Mary J. Blige in a key role.\n\nFrom the moment I started watching, I was captivated by the story. It revolves around a father who stands trial for murder, while his exceptionally bright son seeks a way to secure his father's freedom as he navigates college life. However, the father\u2019s frustration grows, as he yearns for release sooner than his son's efforts can deliver.\n\nThe narrative centers on the young man, named Rob\u2014short for Robert\u2014who faces significant challenges as he strives to earn his degree. Along the way, he discovers a knack for chemistry, which leads him into some difficult situations.\n\nIn general, the film was an engaging experience. However, it felt overly lengthy; there were about 20 to 25 minutes that I found myself skipping, as they contained excessive dialogue that didn\u2019t contribute meaningfully to the plot or character development. It felt like filler that unnecessarily extended the film\u2019s runtime.\n\nThe film\u2019s conclusion is quite emotional and difficult to watch. While I had anticipated Mary J. Blige to play a more substantial role, she delivered her performance well, showcasing her talents as both an actress and a singer.\n\nNow, regarding the lead actor, I found his character to be well-crafted, but his portrayal leaned too heavily into a stereotype. While I don't mean to sound harsh, he came across as overly tough or \"thuggish,\" which detracted from the character\u2019s genuine struggles. I believe he could have better represented someone emerging from a challenging background trying to improve his life, rather than fitting into a gangster archetype. This casting choice made it harder to connect emotionally with the character's journey, as it overshadowed the depth of his struggles throughout the film.",

For every achievement, there was always something pulling him two steps back. Yet, in the process and unfortunate passing he left behind a legacy\u2014perhaps unintended and not the one he truly wanted, but remarkable nonetheless.\n\nThis is the beauty of storytelling and theater. Forget the critics\u2014I think this was absolutely worth watching.",
