The story of the movie was dramatic, inspirational, and romantic. It's about finding what inspires you to do something great and finding true love as well. If you're a Netflix member, you should watch this movie. It's a great movie for couples.",

    "text": "I like both these actors quite a bit. Freddie Prinz did an admirable job, but Aimee Garcia was all wrong for this role. Even the idea behind the movie wasn't awful - aging rock star trying to stay on top. But Aimee is (and I am really sorry to say this) not a leading actress. She is a great sidekick, but everything fell flat in the movie and unfortunately, it was due to her.",

It was so lighthearted, I kept smiling and laughing :) I can't say I felt the same way about Freddie Prinze Jr., I was wondering about his casting way too many times during the film, randomly and spontaneously, the chemistry didn't quite work for me, I'm sorry. I thought the music was so lovely.",
