This movie was so bad that if it put off an odor you wouldn't want to step in it. I was hoping for another movie to add to my yearly Christmas watch list, but what I got was a big disappointment.",

    "text": "Why in the world would you make a Christmas movie where it depicts Santa Claus grabbing a cat by its tail and hurling it like he\u2019s competing for a spot on an Olympic track and field team? Having witnessed such a despicably heinous act in real life, I\u2019m mortified that it even made it into any movie, let alone a Christmas movie. The fact that good Ol\u2019 St. Nick, the bringer of Christmas joy for so many young children, is the one doing the deed makes me nauseous. As a Christmas baby (as in Dec 25th), I\u2019m disgusted at the idea that Santa would do anything so evil, let alone with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye.",

    "text": "I truly loved the original, full of wonder and awe. That means sequel was sure to dazzle me too, right? Sigh. Actually, this movie was quite a let down. While there were moments, especially in the second half of the movie, that recaptured the magic of the original, a majority of the film felt tonally different. Once again, this is a case where the writers took away the wrong messages from the first movie and focused on all the wrong aspects.\n\nSo, what did I like about the movie? We'll, for starters, once again Kurt Russell did an amazing job as Santa Claus. In fact, he's easily my favorite part of the movie. You can tell he relishes in the role too having a good sense of what makes THIS encarnation of the character tick. Also, I enjoyed diving deeper into the lore and backstory, exploring the different cultural mythos of the character.\n\nSo what didn't I like. Tyrese. His performance screamed, \"I need a paycheck.\" I know he wasn't given much to do, but it didn't seem like he even wanted to be there. Also I wasn't a fan of the actor who portrayed the main antagonist. This is partly due to how they wrote the character but I think the creators should've/could've gone a different route. Lastly, the first movie was a fun experience for the whole family whereas this movie felt specifically geared towards kids. What resulted is dialogue that felt unnatural and humor that leaned more towards the goofy instead of the whimsical.",

Also did I meson the horrible charecters, the elves are scary to young viewers and the kids won't even know what's going on. The first one is good but the second is just horrible.the only reason one will watch this is because of how curious one might be on how bad this movie is. There are so many better Christmas films to watch with the family. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!!",

    "text": "\"Christmas Chronicles 2\" loses its holiday charm by misfiring on various fronts. The CGI-rendered elves resemble bizarre, furry creatures, while Belsnickel's miscasting as a brooding teen mars the character's potential. Surprisingly, Tyrese Gibson's appearance offers a glimmer of positivity amidst the chaos.\n\nHowever, the once-lovable characters, especially the girl turned bossy, and the absence of the brother and being replaced by a kid that can't act, result in an uneven narrative. Acting quality dips, accompanied by lackluster effects and disappointing CGI, despite director Chris Columbus's involvement. Kurt Russell continues to shine as Santa, but the movie struggles to recapture the magic.\n\nWhile the casting of Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus brings some joy, \"Christmas Chronicles 2\" falls short of expectations. The storyline lacks engagement, juggling an erratic pace and an unnecessary time travel subplot, leading to an overall sense of dullness and cringe. Sadly, this sequel disappoints more than anticipated, failing to deliver the holiday cheer of its predecessor.",
