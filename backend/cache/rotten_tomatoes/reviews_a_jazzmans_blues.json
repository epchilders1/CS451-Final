    "text": "**SPOILERS AHEAD** \n\nLike most of TP's most recent movies, the acting saves it. Everything else is a let down. The movie is 2 hours long and yet it feels like rarely anything is properly developed. Bayou and Lil Ann's romance happens so fast (which idk if that was done in the 40s) and the letters, while endearing sometimes, took away from the journey as a watcher cause I wanted to just watch the relationship progress and deepen on my own without Bayou's narration of it spelling it all out for us. \n\nThe ending was disappointing. You mean to tell me Leanna didn't tell her own son about her father for all of these years? and he just..goes to sit down on his porch after? Why is Hattie Mae the one giving him the letters? It feels like a cheap surprise ending. I feel like this movie would've been much better as a fight for justice with a love story strewn in. \n\nI will give TP his credit: he does dramatic scenes very well because Bayou's death is haunting.",

I would have to say this has transcended Tyler Perry movies for me. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat, I sank into my seat totally overcome by raw emotion leading me to write this review my first ever movie review.",

Good story, good acting and I always love a film set in the deep south.  One thing I didn't like was when Miss Leann came back somehow only a few years later there were people who did not recognize her as the same girl, Bucket, they knew before??",

    "text": "Music for a start! Great music..but would expect a period film to also adhere to something thats in keeping to the timeline. \nOpening first 6 mins, it's 1926 , sugar shack barn playing jazz from the 50's\nSo music out of sync. Script totally predicable. Nice photography and locations.\nBut ultimately a poor film",

There is lots more to this movie. The acting is wonderful. The movie left me knowing how horrible race relations were and still are evil. And that we should all at least try to get along. Love is much better than hate. I highly suggest this movie for people old enough to understand. I would rate it (R) for violence, nudity and language. It's not for children.",
