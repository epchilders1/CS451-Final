The things that happen are just so confusing and unpredictable. Sometimes unpredictable can be a good thing but not for this film. It\u2019s so unpredictable that everything that happens in this movie just makes me go \u201cWhat the hell is even happening??\u201d. And the worst part, this movie tries to play it off as a good thing like oh having the movie make no sense is a good thing and makes it more interesting like no this is just bad writing. Could of been good but the execution is just bad.",

This whole thing just feels like the Walmart version of inside out and fails to be this movie in every possible way with illumination style of animation. Don\u2019t watch this movie!

O problema que da metade do filme para o final, o filme fica confuso, com v\u00e1rias cenas estranhas, acontecimentos inesperados e um grande caos. O filme se perde numa maluquice, e o final \u00e9 muito mal explicado e sem gra\u00e7a. Pra que dar um salto gigantesco no tempo? Explicaram quase nada e ainda tem um monte de acontecimento sem explica\u00e7\u00e3o! O filme \u00e9 bom, mas acaba sendo estragado, e os outros personagens? Foram descartados.",
