    "text": "Monster Hunter was released in theatres in 2020 and stars Milla Jovovich as the protagonist in another of her husband's, Paul WS Anderson, movies. Anderson is of course known for his terrible Resident Evil films and most recently for In The Lost Lands. Anderson uses a bunch of different tropes for this movie grabbing scenes from Predator, Alien, The Mist, The Dark Tower series, Lord of the Rings, and more. Jovovich plays a female US Ranger Captain in charge of a UN team searching for a lost patrol; yes that's the plot. During the search they are transported to another universe by a magic storm where monsters reign and she has to fight her way to a portal. Nobody in the film knows how to handle a firearm unfortunately so everyone except Jovovich is killed immediately but there's a hunter with a cool bow shooting monsters so we're good. Honestly, I like the CGI locations, some of the monsters looked good, but the plot was horrific (sailing ships on sand lol), and the acting was largely embarrassing. But, this was so bad I actually enjoyed some of it so if you like campy sci-fi action movies this may be for you.",

    "text": "The film starts out fine. The visuals are great and the humor keep me engaged. The characters and setting are well established and I was with the Rangers as all hell broke loose around them.\n\nOnce the Ranger and the Hunter met the film lost me,. The extra long unnecessary fights between the characters made no sense to me. Didn't they just see the giant monsters outside?? Is there not a literal threat just outside the window that take priority to just survive? \n\nI thought we'd get some kind of more established plan to take down some big ass monsters. This part was half-baked and came of as rushed. We get ginat battle after giant battle that ultimately would have been more fun tot play than watch. The final act of the film barely qualified as a movie, more like a sequence of events, a few cut-scenes shown in a row. The narrative payoff is very low, and the visuals get repetitive. The film is begging for a sequel that will never come, hopefully... Which is a shame given the the first act was fun.",

I didn't expect the body count to be so high for a movie based off a video game but did it delivered some fight scenes! I can only hope they produce a sequel!",

Usually these movies can be more fun than mindless but they tried to fit 3 different plot lines in one movie and told completely separate.   Not consistency.  No rhythm.",

I hope they make another one and people give it another shot because it was a really good movie to watch. It was pretty high the last scene was awesome and the CGI was very good. Also the actors were great and the acting was well done.",

    "text": "A military unit crosses dimensions and encounters a bunch of large bugs.  Hilarity ensues.\n\nIt's a good thing I've never played the Monster Hunter video games.  As I understand, it's set in a world where PCs get assignments and go out to kill monsters.  This film isn't that.  Instead of being a film that builds a world, we instead get some Americans going blind into a situation in which they are woefully under prepared.   It takes over an hour to get past the first conflict and once we get to learn about residents of this world the film is over.  And we don't get to learn much about the setting anyway.   I had no idea Javovich, who plays the lead, was Anderson's wife.  Virtually every film he's done since meeting her features her.  She's an okay actress but I think he should quit indulging her.\n\nThe action scenes are decent and I did love the dragon-kin toward the end of the film.\n\nIf you do view it, there is a mid-credit scene.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Ten\u00eda claro que no iba a ver una obra maestra, pero no esperaba algo tan desastroso. Monster Hunter falla en pr\u00e1cticamente todo. Siendo fan del videojuego, lo m\u00ednimo que uno desea es un gui\u00f1o bien hecho o una atm\u00f3sfera parecida. Pues ni eso. La pel\u00edcula es ruido, explosiones, monstruos que apenas transmiten nada y personajes que dan igual. Ni siquiera Milla Jovovich consigue levantar esto, y eso que siempre le tengo cari\u00f1o por su entrega f\u00edsica en este tipo de cintas.\n\nEl guion es una colecci\u00f3n de escenas que no conectan, con una narrativa que parece escrita en una servilleta. La direcci\u00f3n de Paul W.S. Anderson apuesta por la acci\u00f3n sin pausa, pero sin ritmo, sin alma, sin emoci\u00f3n. Hay alguna criatura visualmente interesante, vale, pero el conjunto es tan aburrido que cuesta mantener el inter\u00e9s m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del primer acto.\n\nMe cuesta entender c\u00f3mo se puede desaprovechar tanto material. Y no es una cuesti\u00f3n de presupuesto ni de actores, es que no hay una sola idea buena detr\u00e1s. Es como si todo se construyera con prisas y sin pasi\u00f3n. Una pel\u00edcula que parece hecha para cumplir con una cuota, no para divertir ni para homenajear nada.\n\nLe pongo un 3/10 porque, a pesar de todo, Anderson ha sabido hacer cosas mejores y alguna que otra escena est\u00e1 bien filmada. Pero es un desastre de los que cansan. De esos que ni con palomitas se salvan.\n\n(ENGLISH) I knew I wasn't about to watch a masterpiece, but I didn\u2019t expect something this disastrous. Monster Hunter fails on almost every level. As a fan of the video game, the least you want is a well-done nod or an atmosphere that feels familiar. But no. The film is just noise, explosions, monsters that barely convey anything, and characters you don\u2019t care about. Not even Milla Jovovich can save this, and I usually have a soft spot for her physical commitment in this kind of film.\n\nThe script is a collection of scenes that don\u2019t connect, with a storyline that feels like it was scribbled on a napkin. Paul W.S. Anderson\u2019s direction goes all in on non-stop action\u2014but without rhythm, without soul, without emotion. Some of the creatures look interesting, sure, but the whole thing is so boring that it\u2019s hard to stay engaged beyond the first act.\n\nI struggle to understand how so much material can be so poorly used. And it\u2019s not a matter of budget or actors\u2014it\u2019s just that there\u2019s not a single good idea behind it. It all feels rushed and lifeless. A film made to meet a quota, not to entertain or pay tribute to anything.\n\nI give it a 3/10 because, in spite of everything, Anderson has done better in the past and a couple of scenes are decently shot. But this is a tiring mess. The kind that not even popcorn can save.",

With zero context of why they are here. lol might as well be a commercial for the female actor trying to be the next GI Jane. Just nonstop screaming and grunting. Im amazed at how poor the chemistry is. It was trying to be a starship troopers movie. But that actually was notable with a well built story line.",
