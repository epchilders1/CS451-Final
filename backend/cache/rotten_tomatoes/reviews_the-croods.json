The characters are unique and lovable, and I liked how the story shows the importance of family, change, and working together.

    "text": "The Croods are, to put them in one word...crude.\n\"They're practically animals\", as Guy puts it, and I think he's truthfully right about the titular family and the film itself. It is a crude film. A lot of physical crudeness, such as shaking people to make fire (which doesn't work well) add to the idea of this film being, well...crude.\nBut anyways, this film was pretty good. We have some good music by Silvestri, even if it's mostly copying the song 'Shine your way' in the end credits; some beautiful animation that is sometimes hyper-realistic (or almost); a pretty good plot; and of course the characters themselves, the Croods.\nThunk is possibly the funniest of the cast, though Belt follows close behind. Eep is the rudest, especially to her father, until her personality changes and she sort of shows her respect for him by the end. Guy is...well...Guy, and Sandy is savage. Gran is the stereotypical Gran minus the part where she tries eating people, Ugga the somewhat frustrated mother, and Grug the overprotective father. So, we have quite a clash of personalities here.\nPerhaps, besides the stars scene, my favorite part is the ending, where Grug finally gets his idea, and flies to tomorrow. If you don't know what 'flying to tomorrow' means, then go watch the film. I recommend it, even if it's not perfect.\n\n\"Dun dun dun\u2026\"",
