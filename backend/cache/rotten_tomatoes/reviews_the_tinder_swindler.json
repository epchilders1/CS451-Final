    "text": "This documentary is as dumb as these victims.\nIt's more like a reality drama show than a true-crime documentary.\nSpending too much time to describe how these girls love the prince they believed.\n\nLeave more questions than more answers.\nIs the bodyguard involved part of the fraud?\nHow about the ex-wife with a child?\nAnd how about all these drivers, security teams, and models?\nWhy has Tinder Swinder himself been charged yet?\nIt seems like journalists and other victims already have a lot of chances to approach him. Why the police did not take action? Is it because the police think it is not a\u00a0serious\u00a0case?\nAre the police still trying to find him guilty?\nIs the news about LLD Diamonds just a coincidence, which also makes lies about his danger more convincible?\nWhat's the motive of Simon Leveiv?\n\nHow\u00a0the fk\u00a0these girls not realize it was a scam? Too many red flags.\nThe skill of Anna in Inventing Anna is much better than Simon Leviev's. There are a lot of similarities.\u00a0However, while Anna can convince even the bank,\u00a0the trick Simon Leviev uses\u00a0is an everyday romance scam.\u00a0It is obviously a romance scam. Sending money to a person you don't know is\u00a0definitely\u00a0a nono.",

Not to praise him -- I am so much disgusted with him. But after all of what his done, and how this show has been released, he is still a free man and the victims are still paying off the money he had spent. It is a fucked up reality that even a lot of people (on his Instagram) are praising him and even on his side. He is even verified on Instagram? Wtf. people are crazy. This show needs some attention to let people, especially women be aware of guys like him.",

    "text": "I am not a consumer of documentaries, but this story managed to catch me. It is really entertaining and interesting. The way in which the multiple countries where the scenes were recreated and the victims recounting the situations that they had to go through is told. The criticism of society where it is really sad that instead of blaming the person who cheats, the victims are blamed; We are all human and we can be naive and even more so when love enters the equation. My feeling is that it is a public denunciation by making this story more famous and making it known throughout the world and raising awareness among the users of these apps.",

    "text": "Kinda of a long and tedious production. Newb writer and director Felicity Morris did a decent job with this docufilm, but it certainly needed better editing and to have at least 20 mins chopped out, because the 114 min runtime felt really dragged out, and the slow pacing and many dragged out scenes didn't help. The story itself was remarkable, but after seeing Rogue Agent, I can't wait for Netflix to make a movie about this story.",

    "text": "90%. 5/16/22. The order in which they tell the story really makes it with you seeing a romantic relationship develop, a friendship develop, when he starts frauding them, the first woman taking it to the journalists and then them finding the other girl. The other girl trying to help the journalists locate the guy but get caught taking pictures of him. Then that girl is freaking out afterwards not knowing what he's capable of but then dropping him off. Then they post the story and the gf of 14 months sees it. Then we see all the overlapping times with these girls and she swindles him back with his clothes which is awesome. Then he becomes homeless and they catch him. Just a fascinating story overall. The guy is clearly really smart and good at deceiving people. Would definitely rewatch this.",
