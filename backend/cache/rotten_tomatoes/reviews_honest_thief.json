It is a bit hard to believe that a serial bank robber could be anything but a sociopath (which makes unlikely any relationship between him and the girl}, but nevertheless, because Neeson is the actor the movie is very watchable..  any Neeson film is watchable.",

    "text": "Under-rated. There are any number of familiar plot points, but overall, the story feels somewhat fresh. \n\nDirection is good, disciplined. Camera angles/placement make for smooth cuts and action sequences. Not choppy at all, as so many action films tent to get. And nobody is gooing beyond the believable. The actors are staying within themselves, so to speak, as they should. This is an experienced cast that knows when to push an envelope and when not to. Of course, Neeson sets the standard here, and the Universe is set. \n\nThe movie rolled out logically, felt  the way you'd imagine a real life case of corruption would go down, the kind we read about in the papers from time to time. There was some dialogue I would have liked to see re-written; some of the lines were too common. We've heard them before, so find another way to say the same thing, but differently.\n\nPeople have commented on the pace positively. Didn't feel false, and the pedestrian sequences were nicely filled with information and relationship. \n\nI think this film is good entertainment.  Some of these HIGH energy films are exhausting, and I don't always want that. Just a good story, characters I like, competent story-telling by writer and director and actors. This film has all of that. Quite likable movie.",

    "text": "\"Honest Thief\" features Liam Neeson in a role that feels familiar, typical of his filmography, yet this installment offers a slightly different perspective. It allows viewers to see him in a new light, showcasing his talent in a character that still aligns with his usual action-hero persona.\n\nNeeson is undeniably a fantastic actor, and while many of his films share similar themes and plots, they remain entertaining enough to watch. They're not necessarily ones you'd revisit frequently, and they certainly don\u2019t reach the heights of \"Taken,\" but they maintain a level of enjoyment.\n\nThis particular film is decent enough for a one-time viewing, though I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to highly recommend it. It\u2019s the kind of movie you might watch to pass the time rather than savor. The performances from both Neeson and the lead actress are commendable, but the overall story feels somewhat lackluster. At its core, it\u2019s a classic cop narrative with the typical good guy versus bad guy dynamic.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Si ves el nombre de Liam Neeson en el cartel, ya sabes bastante bien lo que te vas a encontrar. Un ladr\u00f3n honesto no enga\u00f1a a nadie: es una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n modesta, con su buena raci\u00f3n de persecuciones, tiros y un protagonista atormentado que, en el fondo, solo quiere hacer lo correcto.\n\nLa historia arranca con una idea que podr\u00eda haber dado m\u00e1s de s\u00ed: un ladr\u00f3n legendario que decide entregarse para limpiar su nombre. Suena bien, pero enseguida la cosa se desinfla en una trama que no arriesga nada y que se mueve entre t\u00f3picos como quien sigue una receta demasiado vista. Todo resulta demasiado sencillo, demasiado c\u00f3modo, como si no quisieran complicarse m\u00e1s de la cuenta.\n\nEso s\u00ed, Neeson sigue teniendo ese carisma que consigue sostener pel\u00edculas que, de otra manera, se caer\u00edan a pedazos. \u00c9l hace su trabajo, aunque da la sensaci\u00f3n de que podr\u00eda interpretarlo dormido a estas alturas. El resto del reparto cumple sin destacar y la direcci\u00f3n de Mark Williams es correcta, pero poco m\u00e1s.\n\nNo es un desastre, se puede ver sin sufrir, pero tampoco deja huella. Una de esas pelis que, si pillas empezada en la tele un domingo por la tarde, igual te quedas a verla... o igual te echas una siesta.\n\n(ENGLISH) If you see Liam Neeson\u2019s name on a poster, you already know exactly what you\u2019re getting into. Honest Thief doesn\u2019t try to fool anyone: it\u2019s a modest action film, packed with car chases, shootouts, and a tormented main character who, deep down, just wants to do the right thing.\n\nThe story starts with a premise that could have gone further: a legendary thief deciding to turn himself in to clear his name. It sounds promising, but it quickly deflates into a plot that doesn\u2019t take any risks and moves through clich\u00e9s like someone following an old recipe. Everything feels too easy, too safe, as if they didn\u2019t want to make any effort to surprise us.\n\nThat said, Neeson still has enough charisma to carry movies that would otherwise fall apart. He does his job well, even though it feels like he could probably play this role in his sleep by now. The rest of the cast is fine without standing out, and Mark Williams\u2019 direction is competent but nothing special.\n\nIt\u2019s not a disaster\u2014you can watch it without suffering\u2014but it\u2019s not memorable either. One of those films you might catch halfway through on a lazy Sunday afternoon... or maybe you\u2019ll just fall asleep instead.",

    "text": "A Solid Heist with a Touch of Heart (Spoiler-Free)\n\nHonest Thief offers a refreshing twist on the classic heist film. Liam Neeson sheds his usual action hero persona to play a reformed thief with a conscience, and the film explores themes of redemption and second chances. Here's what this flick steals your attention for:\n\u2022\tUnique Premise: The idea of a \"good\" thief trying to go straight adds a layer of intrigue and makes you root for the protagonist.\n\u2022\tNeeson's Subtlety: Liam Neeson delivers a nuanced performance, showcasing a vulnerability not often seen in his action roles.\n\u2022\tA Touch of Romance: The unlikely romance between Neeson's character and a quirky art dealer adds a surprising charm to the film.\n\u2022\tAction with Consequence: The fight scenes, while well-done, have weight to them, highlighting the toll violence takes.\nHowever, Honest Thief doesn't quite crack the vault on a perfect score:\n\u2022\tSomewhat Predictable: The plot unfolds in a fairly linear fashion, with few surprises for seasoned film viewers.\n\u2022\tLimited Character Depth: While Neeson shines, some of the supporting characters feel underdeveloped.\n\u2022\tUneven Pacing: The film drags a bit in the middle section, before picking up the pace again for the climax.\nHonest Thief is a decent heist film with a surprisingly heartwarming core. Liam Neeson brings his star power to the role, and the film offers a unique twist on the genre. While it might not be a mind-blowing cinematic experience, it's an enjoyable watch for a relaxed evening. Earning a 3.5 out of 5 stars, Honest Thief is a solid choice for those looking for an entertaining action film with a touch of heart.\nWorth the time investment!!!\n\n-\tMatthew",
