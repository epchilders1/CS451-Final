Im not a filmmaker but noticed that there were lots of scenes that didn't seem to have cuts (like Birdman).  And it made you feel like you were right there with the characters as things unfolded. Specifically the farm scene... Omg!",

    "text": "Having just watched DUNKIRK, this is a better War film\n\nAfter watching Dunkirk about a month ago, after reading \"The Great War and Modern Memory\", I must say this far succeeds Dunkirk as far as realistic portrayals of the actual daily life of World War I. Yes, it was daily life for hundreds of thousands of British and French people fighting the authoritarian German government. Like today's America, the country of Germany was swayed and rocked by authoritarian rulers. This movie hit home as scary, for these reasons. Trench warfare; going from trench to trench, is a big part of this one-shot film that was directed with skill by Sam Mendes of American Beauty. The problem with the one-shot is that it minimizes the struggles that were seemingly endless, rather than capsulated. Where the film said that the characters traveled 11 miles, it looked more like a mile and half in real life (as a trained cross-country runner, I'm very good with distances). The surrealness of the film weighed it down. However, the realistic aspect did actually outweigh it. The fact that generals for Britain often exaggerated their battalions'' abilities and sent them to die was exonerated by the fact that in this movie, the general undermines the colonels. However, like in real life, the colonels would often say to themselves \"We're losing a battle, and should retreat\". This movie was moving and brilliant. Like great epics of the past, it focuses on singular moments that inspire awe from the audience. So, while Dunkirk's high flying aviation battles are a must-see, I highly recommend 1917 as the superior film.",
