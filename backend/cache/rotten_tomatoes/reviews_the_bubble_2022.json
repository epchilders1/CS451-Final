It came out mid Covid era, and offered a bit of escapism, with some laughs sprinkled throughout. Also the score must receive a mention, Michael Andrews really brought it home, along with a Kim Wilde song, giving you a  sort of \"Breakfast Club\" feeling. Fun 6/10",

The fact that the actual world was terrified of everyone dying... and that Hollywood would make it a top priority to get Cliff Beasts 6 out for distribution",

Just skip this one,  it's not worth it.",
