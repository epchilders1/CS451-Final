Though the film doesn't tell the full story, it's an impressive, educational, and entertaining dramatization.",

I was excited to watch this movie, but it didn't quite line up with my expectations. I thought all of the acting was really well done, but some of the production I thought kind of missed the mark. I found that the soundtrack often came in at times and overpowered some of the acting that was going on in the scenes. That made me lower my review a bit for this film. I'm glad that I watched it, but it probably won't be one that I will rewatch to be honest.",

    "text": "A very entertaining and fascinating biopic about the very recent bizarrely cathartic class warfare between Reddit and Hedge Funds over the fate of GameStop through a clever series of clever financial tactics using Wall Street\u2019s underhanded stock market tricks against them. The cast is excellent and share solid chemistry and witty banter. It\u2019s surprisingly investing despite all of the cringey at-the-time trendy Reddit/TikTok slang/memes of the time thanks to its emotional core of the story that treats all of these characters as real people with real personal struggles that lie behind the surface that keeps them motivated to support this GameStop revolution in the first place. It\u2019s certainly not going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I personally had a great time watching this and would definitely recommend it.",
