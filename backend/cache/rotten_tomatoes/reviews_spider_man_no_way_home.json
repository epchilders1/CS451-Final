    "text": "This is the only MCU Spider-Man rerelease I wanted to watch in the theatres, and I knew it wouldn't be as good as watching it the first day. I knew a lot of it didn't really make much sense, but the plot really doesn't make any sense at all during the first half. The MIT stuff, the way the law gets involved, was all really stupid, but the core plot of how the redemption of those people is his responsibility is beyond ridiculous. \n\nBut everything around the plot that gives the momentum still works bloody well. The humour did work for me more than I thought it would this time. I still love all the cameos. I also feel like Willem Dafoe was even better here than in the original Spider-Man. But Andrew Garfield is my favourite part of this movie. I wish he had actually got a chance to conclude his movies. I really liked how they decided to end it, too, even though a lot of it still doesn't make any sense. \n\nAmong the rereleases, this felt like the one with the least image quality, even though this was the only one that had an IMAX rerelease. Even the actual vfx quality felt poor. I noted it especially about Doc Ock, because Spider-Man 2 was great to watch on the big screen, and this just didn't have that detail in it. It just seems like, due to bad CGI, they had to kind of make everything look a little less clear.\n\nOverall, this had a lot of problems, but the second half of the movie worked really well and made it feel more like the earlier superhero films which I enjoyed a lot.",

    "text": "Watched Spider-Man : No Way Home during its re-release in Mumbai theatres for just \u20b9105. Unlike the earlier Spider-Man portrayals that carried a sense of maturity, this film is clearly designed with teenagers in mind.  \n\nIf the story had followed Doctor Strange\u2019s wisdom, the film could have ended in an hour. However, Peter Parker\u2019s immaturity, indecisiveness, and lack of experience stretch the narrative into a 2.5-hour journey. This highlights that the new Spider-Man is still learning, far less seasoned than his predecessors.  \n\nIt is only through personal loss especially the death of his mother figure that he gains exposure to the harsh realities of life and begins to grow. This emotional turning point pushes him forward, shaping his path as a hero.  \n\nOverall, I would give this film a 3-star rating.",

The ending thought was definitely something unexpected for me, I did not see it coming on how they end it AT ALL!! Such an emotional rollercoaster, but an amazing one. \nNothing more to say other than this movie is perfect.",

The movie mixes humor, drama, and big epic moment it\u2019s a very fun movie who bring the others spider man from others movies  and this make the movie epic and nostalgic in the same time.",

This movie also had good plot and lore then just all the characters.",

    "text": "Critics Consensus:\nEmotional, exhilarating, and unapologetically nostalgic, Spider-Man: No Way Home delivers a thrilling celebration of the web-slinger\u2019s cinematic legacy. While its plot occasionally strains under the weight of multiverse chaos, the film\u2019s heart, humor, and sense of wonder more than make up for it.\n\nTom Holland gives his most mature and emotionally charged performance yet, grounding the spectacle in genuine feeling. The return of familiar faces\u2014from past Spider-Man eras\u2014feels both crowd-pleasing and surprisingly heartfelt, weaving together nearly two decades of storytelling with reverence and care. Director Jon Watts balances bombastic action and intimate character moments, crafting a finale that feels epic yet deeply personal.\n\nWhile not flawless or subtle, No Way Home captures the pure joy of being a Spider-Man fan. It\u2019s a blockbuster fueled by emotion, redemption, and legacy\u2014one that reminds us why the friendly neighborhood hero continues to matter.",

That freakin brought my 5-6 year old life back to life, but anyways I saw this in the theaters and it was INSANE!!! Everyone was throwing popcorn and candy infact a popcorn hit my eye and now I have a scar across my eye, but anyways I give this a full without a doubt 5!!!!!!",

    "text": "I very much enjoyed \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home.\u201d It was an action-packed, beautifully written masterpiece. The sheer emotion Tom Holland delivered through every line sent actual shock waves through my body. Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also gave an AMAZING performance as Ned and MJ respectively. The ending was the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever watched in my life, hands down. I was sobbing on the ground once I finished the movie because of the raw emotion I felt. I also loved seeing Andrew and Tobey side-by-side with Tom on the big screen, and the best part of it was it wasn\u2019t just a cameo or fan service, they were genuinely important supporting characters that contributed to the plot line. This movie wasn\u2019t a traditional feel-good Superhero movie, but it was different and more importantly so SO emotional, and that\u2019s what made it so good.",
