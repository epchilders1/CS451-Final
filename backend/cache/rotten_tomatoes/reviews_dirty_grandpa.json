Zac Efron was pretty decent too, I think most if not all the jokes landed for me. This movie is a good time and that\u2019s all it needed to be. You\u2019re not getting the next \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d out of this. It\u2019s exactly what the title implies and it does it well. 4/5 stars.",

Well, he\u2019s not the stellar performer he was in, say, The Intern \u2014 but he\u2019s entertaining as entertaining can be, from beginning to end. As are all the other main characters, in fact. Except for the implausible + soppy bit at the end, 4 or 5 stars any day. Plenty of fun for the entire family! [Just kidding \u2014 this movie is a serious R!]",

    "text": "I watched this on DVD recently.  I have very mixed feelings about this movie, and especially the way it ends.  I thought it started quite well, building on the solid foundation if reviving a relationship between an elderly widower (Dick) and his grandson (Jason) who had drifted apart during their lives.  It makes sense that Dick wants to make the most of the life he has left, and the contrast between him and Jason is fun to watch at first.  The problem for me was that Dick becomes quite obsessed about making love to the much younger college girl they meet, which takes over the rest of the story.  I expected Dick to find a deeper meaning to his life via his time spent with Jason, but he doesn't.  I found the ending very strange and rather uncomfortable to watch.  If the movie was designed to challenge age stereotypes it succeeds, but in a way that I found unpleasant and disagreeable.  I don't recommend this movie because it made me feel uncomfortable and dirty.",
