I loved it, but contradictorily, some parts confused me. For example, when there's the deal with the guy with the wig, and we only find out halfway through the movie. I loved it.",

The story is deep and emotional, love the medieval vibe in it. Though the alternate reality thing is not that great, because Fiona's growth in 4 is just completely erased after Shrek gets back. Those characters we were with the whole film are just... gone. Overall, it's fine.",

    "text": "The fourth installment in the Shrek franchise, Shrek Forever After, takes the series in a different direction \u2014 and while it\u2019s not a bad film, it definitely doesn\u2019t reach the same heights as the first three.\n\nOne of the biggest positives is consistency: the original cast stuck around not only through the main films but also through the shorts and side projects, keeping the voices and personalities we\u2019ve grown to love intact. That loyalty to continuity is something DreamWorks deserves credit for, because it keeps the world of Shrek cohesive and familiar.\n\nStory-wise, however, this one leans heavily into the alternate-universe concept. The focus on Shrek\u2019s midlife crisis and his longing for freedom from the responsibilities of fatherhood sends a strange message at times, almost suggesting that parenthood is a burden rather than a joy. I understand what they were going for \u2014 starting with Shrek\u2019s personal growth, then Fiona, then marriage and pregnancy, and now children \u2014 but instead of centering the story on the kids as you might expect, the children are sidelined.\n\nRumpelstiltskin serves as the villain, and while he\u2019s serviceable, he doesn\u2019t hit nearly as hard as Lord Farquaad, Prince Charming, or the Fairy Godmother. He\u2019s mischievous and manipulative, but he lacks that truly menacing quality that made the earlier villains iconic.\n\nThe real problem is that this film strips away too much of Shrek\u2019s lovable grumpiness and instead paints him as bitter, resentful, and outright hateful for a good portion of the runtime. That shift makes it harder to root for him or even enjoy his journey. It feels less like a fairy-tale parody with heart and more like a midlife crisis comedy wrapped in fantasy packaging.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s still worth a watch, especially if you\u2019ve followed the franchise this far. It keeps the storyline complete, and there are moments of humor, heart, and cleverness sprinkled throughout. But compared to the first three, it feels like the magic got bogged down in the swamp.\n\nWould I rewatch it? Probably, but not nearly as often as the others. It\u2019s more of a \u201ccompletionist\u201d entry \u2014 good enough to see where the story goes, but not essential in the way the earlier films are.",

    "text": "It's better than 3 but such a downgrade still from the first two. It's not bad overall. Animation wise it's the best looking out of the four for sure. It starts out really fast and setting everything up and is defintely the best part. Than once the new reality happens it just slowly gets bogged down. First off it keeps throwing nostaglia at you with locations, characters, and scenes from the first mostly that just make you wish you were watching the first. Second the whole plot in the middle with Fionna as a rebel leader against Rumpelstiltskin is just...kind of bizarre. It feels almost like a post apocalyptic world than anything Shrek related. And finally it pretty much follows the exact same beats you think it's going too. Rumpelstiltskin starts out a cool villian but the more it goes the more over the top, annyoing, and cliche he becomes it feels like. Just another 007 villian he becomes. Than it has everyone pretty much just following the smae arcs they did in the first save for Shrek. And it all just feels like a combinaton of muddled, beats we've already hit, things that are out of place, and nothing that special. It makes perfect sense though. The humor is a bit flat but not terrible at the same time. Overall, it's a better note to end things on. If your a hardcore fan of any voice actors in this or the franchise give this a watch especially if you sat through 3.. But most woud be best served staying with the first two classics.",
