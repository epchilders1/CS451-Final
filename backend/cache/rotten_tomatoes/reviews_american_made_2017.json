I enjoyed both the Top Gun films however, this was more entertaining because it\u2019s based on a true story from the Cold War. To add on from my perspective, it doesn\u2019t always take crazy stunts to make a better movie. If that\u2019s all I want, I\u2019ll just pop in the movie \u201cJackass\u201d lol.",
