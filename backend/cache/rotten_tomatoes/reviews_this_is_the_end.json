    "text": "I\u2019m sure Seth and his mates had fun making this but it\u2019s a bit self indulgent. All the in jokes and laughing at yourself, if overdone just comes across as conceited. It\u2019s almost ironic but that\u2019s how it comes across. The general plot, which is weak gets lost amongst the overplayed self deprecation. Kinda just boring and not particularly funny in the end. The Emma Watson scene made me laugh though. Watched on Amazon Prime.",

It's absolutely unrivalled and matchless in its stupidity and its blatant, literally \"in your face\" raunchy toilet humor. It is so lowbrow, mindless and stupid that every single minute of this movie hurts watching if you have more than a single working brain cell. The only half comprehensible positive aspect is that you can see how much fun some of the actors had creating this piece of junk. \n\nCall it art if you like. I call it a total waste of time and resources.",

Either way, this is still really fun\u2014a whole lot of fun from start to finish. The casting is insanely good. I absolutely love Danny McBride, and that end sequence still, to this day, the best. Definitely recommended!",

    "text": "THIS IS THE END has some great self-deprecating celebrity gags early on\u2014most of which you'll see in the trailer\u2014which makes for an engaging opening. Things then swiftly devolve into a frat house at the end of time, with dudes yelling insult jokes at one another. The commitment to the bit (that this the actual apocalypse) elevates the effort, but it really feels like the actors may be having way more fun than the viewers. It's probably comedy gold for young men of a certain age, but not otherwise.",

It seems like these fellas really enjoyed making this film and were able to have creative control. Special effects were awesome. \nThere's a great message for us all in the end scenes. Thanks for the laughs! Needed it.",
