If you add to that, a storyline that gets increasingly less believable as the film progresses, you end up with the good ole \"what could have been\" but wasn't.",

    "text": "Early on in the movie, our careless protagonist gets himself and his girlfriend in a car accident, in a totally preventable tragedy. Then the movie devolves further into a series of endless nonsensical events. Fast-forward and there were a couple of plot twists in the last 30 minutes, but they all fell flat because it was already too late to save this poorly written and scripted movie. It's a messy plot and storyline that is full of holes. It just doesn't make sense or add up. There are too many unbelievable and ridiculous coincidences and events throughout the movie, especially towards the end. They are almost laughable. In the last 20 minutes, our protagonist turns into some type of superhuman vigilante. Then suddenly and abruptly you have a lousy ending. Oh, and John David Washington is a terrible actor.",

    "text": "The protagonist couple in \"Beckett\" (John David Washington as the title character and Alicia Vikander as April) are so nauseatingly cute in the first 10 minutes of this film, I nearly stopped watching. Their conversations were so full of silly double entendres, under-the-table knee bumps, and sly grins, I kept thinking: Are people really this annoying when they're in love? In a cafe scene, Beckett looks into April's's eyes and says, \"I'm having a love attack.\" Excuse me while I vomit.\n\nThankfully, something horrible happens before the introductory scenes can drag on any longer. Driving at night on a narrow mountain road after a day of sightseeing in Greece, Beckett and April plunge down an embankment, rolling the car and crashing into an abandoned house. Beckett survives; April does not.\n\nBeckett tells the cops that he thinks he saw a woman and a red haired boy in the house. Big mistake. He saw something he shouldn't have seen, and political intrigue ensues. It turns out that the boy he saw is the kidnapped nephew of a major political figure in Greece, and the corrupt cops are in on it. Beckett must be killed, since he is a witness. Returning to the scene of the accident, Beckett is shot at by a woman who is accompanied by one of the cops who interviewed him. He spends the rest of the movie running from bad guys and trying not to get killed. It's the stereotypical \"wrong man\" scenario. \n\n\"Beckett\" is beautifully filmed, with glorious shots of the rocky Greek countryside. The interior and city scenes are impressive, too, with vivid colors and lighting. Cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom makes it look like a Hitchcock movie, and that's not a bad thing. \n\nWashington, who was so strong in \"BlacKk Klansmen,\" tries hard here, and he's pretty convincing. Of course, he has to mysteriously develop kick-ass physical abilities, ala Liam Neeson, as he flees from his enemies, but that's to be expected in a chase film. After all, could Cary Grant really climb Mount Rushmore? Of course. Otherwise, there would be no movie. Still, considering the beating that Beckett takes\u2013shot, stabbed, his arm broken, and surviving two car wrecks\u2013the implausibility factor is pretty high.\n\nVarious Greek locals, who unanimously seem to distrust cops, help Beckett as he tries to reach  the U.S. Embassy in Athens. They're all interesting, colorful people, and they add a lot to the story. \n\nI've made a couple of Hitchcock references (there's even a scene on a train), and his influence is evident here. Once we get into the action, not a scene is wasted, and the suspense is palpable.\n\nNo, \"Beckett\" is not at the level of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" or \"North by Northwest,\" but it holds its own as a chase movie. The biggest problem is that the complex political aspect of the plot is not clearly delineated. I got lost trying to figure it out. \n\nNot that it matters. What holds your attention is watching a good guy having the worst day of his life and surviving it.",

The plot was extremely predictable and implausible, the characters were generic idiots, the dialogue was ludicrously fake at times, and the action was silly throughout. Then the pacing was dragged out, the acting was very mediocre, the cinematography and visual effects were average at best, and the soundtrack was forgettable. However, the costumes, makeup, sets, and props were fine, and there was some good variation due to the travelling.",
