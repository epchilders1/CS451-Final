    "text": "A atriz principal tem potencial se estudar mais. Al\u00e9m de ser muito bonita. Fora isso, o roteiro tem um conceito interessante mas com uma profundidade de um pires. Os personagens rasos e burros fazem querer que morram logo. Primeiro temos um pouco de publicidade da praia local, depois clich\u00eas do homem mal e muitos clich\u00eas sobre como tudo \u00e9 feito porcamente. Pulando muitas partes temos um momento que o homem mal pensa que a mocinha quase morta quer transar com ele ?! Melhor parte? O trabalho da guarda costeira. Ah temos tamb\u00e9m uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o bem especial de 2 cenas do pai se importando, rsrs",

I will say that they teased some scenes out a little bit too long, and I'm not crazy about all the body shots that the camera person was doing over the main character who supposed to be a teenager, but the movie was interesting enough to hold my interest for most of it. Kind of a different concept.",

Enough and there is tension and too much you start to say enough. (Aka the beacon in the water scene or the shooting the spear gun). I liked all the actors and quite a handsome villain.  You almost felt sexual tension at the same time you felt horror.  Well done.",

Even worse ending. \n\nOddly enough the story would have been a great concept (similar to Traffik with Paula Patton) but it's like the writers did everything in their power to NOT flesh out this story. \n\nIt was definitely a waste of time lol.

This entire movie can be summed up as 100% just showing one character\u2019s body from different angles. That\u2019s it.\n\nThe plot? I get it\u2026 I think. But does the plot even realize it\u2019s supposed to be a plot? I\u2019m 44 minutes in, yet it feels like I\u2019ve been watching this for hours. I\u2019m genuinely confused about what\u2019s happening.\n\n0/10. Would not recommend. Good night.",

    "text": "SPOILER:\n\nWhere do I start, great concept. AWFUL execution! The tan guy\u2019s lines and acting was awful and corny, the main characters best friend was in agonizing pain in one scene then squirming around painlessly the next. \n\nTowards the end it only got worse, the girl was stabbed with a quarter of a pocket knife and it leaves her immobile? Then from the second deck of the boat, throwing a square plastic device onto a wet plastic boat edge, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY it sticks to the edge of the boat from that trajectory, I don\u2019t even think if you dropped it from 3ft straight down it was stuck to the edge like it did. \n\nFinally, with the girls stab wound, bleeding stopped itself, she\u2019s checked for a pulse, she has one, checked again less than 10sec later, it\u2019s still there. Then suddenly with no blood loss she loses her pulse when she\u2019s gets in the helicopter? \n\nI\u2019m all for some unrealism in movies but this movie was a hard watch and left me cringing with the how poorly is was made, unfortunate, I think it had really good potential.",
