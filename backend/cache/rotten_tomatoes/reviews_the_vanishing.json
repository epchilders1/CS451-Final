You need to see everything that is being said. \n\nDo not read any reviews about this film, before watching it. I cannot stress this enough. \n\nThe film is quite short, and I would recommend you watch it in one sitting. Don\u2019t have anything you need to do after the film. You will need time to process it. \n\nThis film tackles a familiar subject in unique ways. \n\nHappy viewing. \ud83d\ude0e",

    "text": "The best approach is blindness, only know that it\u2019s a psychological thriller that irrationally dissects a maddening reason. But if you\u2019re one of those when the film entered your radar by reading about is twist, then [separate] expectations would criticize the structural buildup to not take a more horrific turn to a similar circumstance. Though the film lost itself in age, it remains effectively haunting with a fine screenplay well executed with a level mind. (B)",

    "text": "Often referred to as one of the scariest films of all time, The Vanishing isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a conventional scary film. Its not even really a horror, more of a psychological thriller about a man who\u2019s wife has gone missing, and all the trauma and heartbreak that entails. It\u2019s interesting in the perspective we see the case through, because unlike typical kidnapping stories where we spend the majority of time with either the victim or their loved ones, here we get a lot of time with the kidnapper himself. This has the effect of humanising him and, in a freaky way, getting us to see the events from his viewpoint. He\u2019s not some snarly madman who constantly taunts the kidnappee, he\u2019s a fairly ordinary family man who\u2019s determined to commit a despicable act simply to prove something to himself. People have heaped praise on the ending, and while I certainly wasn\u2019t left chilled to my bones by it, the lack of closure and finality, as well as how our protagonist got himself into that situation in the first pace, is what really sets it apart. Much like Funny Games, the director of this film took it upon himself to direct an American live action remake. I haven\u2019t seen it yet so I cant pass judgement, but I\u2019ll be very surprised if it managed to capture the same subtle terror and dread of its European predecessor.",

    "text": "Watched this movie because it's often brought up by directors and writers in the horror genre as one of their faves. Definitely well-made. Intense. Thoughtful. I've continued to think about it (which I think can be a mark of a good movie). The ending is abrupt, and I was surprised (because people don't usually take this route when ending a story of this nature), but it was very interesting. It's one of those movies that made me put myself in the place of various characters and consider what I would do in the same situation. I've also pondered the character motivations and the significance of those and how it applies to real life (evil exists: how do my own motivations, traits, defects play a role in resisting or connecting to evil?).",
