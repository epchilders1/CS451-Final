    "text": "\"Boss Baby: Christmas Bonus\" jingles into the holiday cheer with a mix of festive fun and occasional misfires. Surprisingly better than anticipated, this seasonal special sparkles with witty humor and a cleverly written storyline. The voice acting shines, even without Alec Baldwin's Boss Baby at the helm. The animation sleigh-rides between decent and delightful, though the pacing feels as wobbly as a new elf on ice skates.\n\nTurning Santa into a former Boss Baby is a stroke of genius, but the over-reliance on repetitive bodily function jokes; the fart and poop variety might make you wish for a fresher gag stocking. The notion of baby elves is adorable, yet the charm can't entirely mask the unevenness of the narrative.\n\nIn essence, \"Boss Baby: Christmas Bonus\" delivers a good dose of holiday cheer and clever twists but might leave you torn between giggles and groans. It's a merry mix that might resonate differently with each viewer, making it a gift wrapped in mixed feelings.",
