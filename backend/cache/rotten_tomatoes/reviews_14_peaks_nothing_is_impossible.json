    "text": "In April of 2019, Nirmal Purja embarked on Project Possible, a seemingly impossible attempt to climb the world's fourteen highest peaks, all greater than 8,000 meters, over the span of several months.  14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible is a story of the importance of family, of pride in your nation, of unflinching devotion to a dream, and the ability to overcome impossible odds.  While there may be some faults with the documentary (the animated sequences feel unnecessary and some of the background details may be excessive), it is an inspirational film featuring absolutely stunning scenery and an immensely likeable protagonist who spreads positive vibes to all of those he comes into contact with, including the audience of the documentary.",

In this case, showcasing long overdue respect, recognition, and gratitude toward the Nepalese climbing culture. Nims and his team above all just seem like good people. Good people, accomplishing the near impossible while holding the view of benefitting others. Highly recommend!",

It was rightly mentioned that you usually hear an explorer guided by a 'Sherpa', never the name of the Sherpa. Also great to finally see Nepalese achievements getting some limelight in Western media.",

I can assure you it is better than 90% of what Hollywood puts out these days.",

The real-life footage of the vistas captured during the expeditions is stunning. It is motivating to watch an individual's willpower, spirit, and determination, how he and his team make the impossible possible.\n\nLoved the way they celebrate the inspiring community of the Sherpa's, the best kind of nationalism which should be shown on screen. This documentary deserves more renown.",
