We see many returning characters from the second film and are also introduced to new characters, like Peter Maxwell, who is oh so charming. The film has quite a bit of tension and a sexual undertone, which suits the film well and you can't help but get quite giddy ;)\n\nThe film is a good conclusion to The Princess Switch series and you won't regret watching it!",

    "text": "I still feel like adding a third was distracting from the original storyline. And still believe that Lady Margaret and Kevin have no chemistry, but they have somehow progress further than the other duo. Stacy De Novo and Prince Edward in my opinion have better chemistry and the reason I fell in love with the first. But they seem stuck, they are in the same place as they were in the first movie. We have to believe that Edward is still prince and not king and that the pair have no plans to start a family. It just seems that the last two movies of focused on Lady Margaret and Kevin relationship with the addition of Fiona.",

Fiona is the best of the 3 lookalikes because she is purposely unrealistic and her character is exaggerated to the max; which makes her a good main character as it is hard to believe what the writers wan't you to believe about the perfection of the other two.",

I wasn't even sure I wanted to watch this third one because I didn't really love the Fiona character in the second one. But I finally figured I'd see it, just so I could say I watched all three. And I've gotta say, I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed this third one. More than I expected to. It wasn't like the other two--this one is more of a heist movie, and I love heist movies, so that could be why I vibed with it. It was funny and I ended up liking Fiona quite a lot by the end. She turned out to be a far more interesting character than Stacy and Margaret.",

The message in this movie is about forgiveness, love, understanding, and patience which reflects the true meaning of Christmas. Vanessa Hudgens is a great actress.

    "text": "Meeh... That's the best way to sum this movie up. It's perfect for the type of situation I was in when I watched it. Before going to sleep, didn't feel like browsing so when it popped up in recommendations I hit play.\nThe storyline is ok I guess, but there are too many exag\u00e9rations on the main character.. All those \"perfect sexy thief\" moves she performs during the heist feel way too exagerated, cheap. She didn't make me believe it. \nPlus it doesn't match the rest of the character. You can't show a cardashian type of girl all through the  series and then make me believe that when she puts a black suit she transforms into a ninja. \nI didn't like the fact that when it \"snowed\" there was actually no snow on people's clothes... And in this movie the husbands actually have no real part... They are just there, hanging around, approving or disapproving from time to time. But anyway, it's not running for the Oscar  sooo I'll just stop here with the criticism.. It's a nice movie all in all but nothing wow.",
