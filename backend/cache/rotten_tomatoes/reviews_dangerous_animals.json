I think some of these injurys would put you in a lot more pain in which is not acting very well. Overall I think the ending could of been better and less predictable.",

The bloody yacht does not shake or move in any of scenes whilst in waters, it is very steady like it\u2019s on ground resting isn\u2019t it? \nThere is no wind in most of the scenes in the ocean\u2026. The entire movie does not show a life boat tied to this yacht but when the villain wants to catch the girl back from the island he suddenly gets a life boat with a speed motor fitted in it already\ud83d\ude02!\nThe girl cannot hold her breath whilst getting choked for 10 seconds but when she\u2019s underwater watching that shark come close to her, she can hold her breath for soo long changing into a mermaid huh? How did she even see the shark inside the water soo clearly in the dark? \nAnd that one scene, just one scene where they needed to put some money with the cgi, shark biting off the villain, the CGI is worst than a cartoon man! \nWith all due respect, whoever has made this movie, please go shove it up ur mom\u2019s azz! \nLogic comes from ur brains or from ur diks? \nBaaaastards! \nU better make some logical movies otherwise I wish u all the bad luck!",

Loved the final girl - she was a badass and didn't feel like a mary sue at all. \n\nI've watched it twice since buying it and regret not seeing it in the theatre!",

    "text": "Dangerous Animals (2025)\nExcellent Horror Thriller\n(12,036 \u2013 03 Nov 2025 \u2013 by Claudio Carvalho)\nIn Australia, the tourists Greg (Liam Greinke) and Heather (Ella Newton) seek out Captain Bruce Tucker (Jai Courtney), who owns a shark cage diving company. They sail with him, see the sharks and out of the blue, Tucker kills Greg and kidnaps Heather. Meanwhile, the surfer Zephyr (Hassie Harrison) meets Moses Markley (Josh Heuston), who asks her to give a jump-start in his car with her van. Zephyr is a free-spirited independent woman who lives in her van, and Moses is a realtor and surfer. There is a chemistry between them, and they have one night stand, but Zephyr leaves his house early in the morning. When she stops her van in an isolated area, Tucker sees her and abducts her. When Zephyr wakes up, she realizes that she is cuffed to a bed with Heather in Tucker\u2019s vessel. Further, they learn that Tucker is a deranged shark-obsessed serial killer that films his victims being eaten by sharks and selects lonely women to feed the sharks. Meanwhile, Moses notes that something happened to Zephyr and seeks her out. \n\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d (2025) is an excellent horror thriller with a gripping story. The plot is tense, and the characters are well developed throughout the story. Jai Courtney has a magnificent performance in the role of a deranged shark-obsessed serial killer. His performance is impressive from the very beginning and is worthwhile watching. Hassie Harrison is one of the most beautiful actresses and very talented, and her character Zephyr is attractive and charismatic. Josh Heuston successfully complete the trio of protagonists, never giving up of Zephyr, My vote is eight.\nTitle (Brazil): \u201cAnimais Perigosos\u201d (\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d)\nMy Blog: https://maniacosporfilme.wordpress.com/",

    "text": "O longa combina o suspense caracter\u00edstico dos filmes de terror com a assustadora tem\u00e1tica de tubar\u00f5es, apresentando cenas sangrentas, tens\u00e3o e atua\u00e7\u00f5es marcantes. Embora haja algumas reviravoltas excessivas, o filme ainda tem suas falhas, mas proporciona uma experi\u00eancia intensa e sufocante que mant\u00e9m o p\u00fablico envolvido. Como uma fus\u00e3o de um thriller de sobreviv\u00eancia e um filme sobre criaturas mortais, essa produ\u00e7\u00e3o entrega emo\u00e7\u00f5es que geram um prazer culposo e v\u00e1rios sustos eficazes. Para aqueles que buscam um filme que traga algo diferente, mas que n\u00e3o seja completamente original, h\u00e1 uma boa sequ\u00eancia de mortes criativas e sangrentas.",

Lots of solid parts on their own but all together they make a predictable & cyclical plot, even if that\u2019s the point. The score is really good & fuels all the emotions of each scene. The leads bring crowd pleasing performances from psychotic to empowering. It\u2019s fun & has easy investments but a bit too heavy handed & cheesy to fully work for me.",

Watch this movie just to admire her. I can't wait to see more of Hassie Harrison. A couple of things made me like this movie less, the introduction of a love interest really wasn't necessary. What was the point? Did we need that? Did she need that? Also, I'm a little tired of the serial killer dancing in his underwear. Do we know if they really do that or are we still romanticizing toxic men?",

    "text": "***WARNING*** this movie will cause heart palpitations, blurry vision, unsteady respirations, and will likely result in necessary therapy in some individuals, view at your own risk. Jai Courtney's performance is nothing short of Oscar worthy. His demented vision of a shark obsessed serial killer is the best work I've seen from him. His menacing madness will haunt you well after the credits have rolled. Hassie Harrison is no final girl either. You will feel all her trauma, her horror, and her desperate drive for survival in every drop of blood that spills onto the deck of this wave tossing thrill ride. This is an independent film. IF there are studio production execs that turned down this movie, fire them today!  This movie delivers!",
