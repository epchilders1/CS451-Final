    "text": "everything unfolds for a reason\n\nI first watched Look Both Ways back in 2023, and recently rewatched it 2025  and wow, it still hits deep. I watched it again mostly because of David Corenswet. He looked so different then\u2014not the bulky Superman we know now\u2014but he had that same quiet charm that draws you in. The story is simple but powerful. It beautifully shows how no matter which path life takes you, everything unfolds for a reason. It reminded me that life may not go exactly as planned, but in the end, things work out. Every version of life has meaning. Faith is faith. If you need comfort, clarity, or just a little hope\u2014this movie is exactly that. Highly recommend giving it a watch (or rewatch). \ud83c\udf3f",

    "text": "A Charming Exploration of \"What If...?\" (Spoiler-Free)\nLook Both Ways takes a simple yet delightful premise and spins it into a heartwarming journey of self-discovery. Lili Reinhart shines as Natalie, a college grad facing a life-altering choice. The film then cleverly splits into two paths, letting us see how her life unfolds depending on that single decision. Here's what makes Look Both Ways a pleasant watch:\n\u2022\tRelatable Heroine: Lili Reinhart brings a genuine charm to Natalie, making her struggles and triumphs feel real.\n\u2022\tDual-Narrative Twist: The concept of exploring two alternate realities is engaging, allowing us to ponder the possibilities within our own lives.\n\u2022\tUplifting Message: Look Both Ways ultimately celebrates the journey, emphasizing how happiness can be found regardless of the path we choose.\nHowever, Look Both Ways might not be for everyone due to these reasons:\n\u2022\tLighter on Plot: The focus is more on character growth and emotional exploration than intricate storylines.\n\u2022\tFamiliar Territory: The \"sliding doors\" concept has been explored before, so the narrative might feel predictable for some.\n\u2022\tLimited Depth: While the film is heartwarming, it doesn't delve too deeply into complex emotional territories.\nLook Both Ways is a charming and heartwarming film, perfect for a feel-good night in. It might not be a groundbreaking cinematic experience, but it offers a relatable protagonist, a clever narrative twist, and a positive message. For a light and optimistic exploration of life's choices, Look Both Ways earns a delightful 3 out of 5 stars.\nYou DO need to pay attention!  I think it\u2019s worth the time investment.  \n\n-Matthew",

    "text": "Well this was a plot that I haven\u2019t seen before or at least from what I can remember. If you\u2019re going through a hard time or maybe you\u2019re not liking the hand you\u2019ve been dealt right now then I think this may be a movie for you. It has its highs and lows throughout the movie but in the end just shows that every story can turn itself around with a little grit and perseverance. You can still achieve your goals even if it takes a little longer than others. Give it a watch, it\u2019s heart warming and sure may be corny at times but it\u2019s a great flick.",

Expect some hard questions asked but with powerful answers provides. Definitely a film meant for someone who feels deeply or has been through some tough choices in life. Others might not grasp the heart in this film.",

    "text": "\"Look Both Ways\" is an okay movie with a great message. I liked the concept of this movie and think it is a clever idea. I did feel that the story could have been more interesting and engaging, but I still liked what it was trying to say. The journey is sweet and good-natured enough for a casual one-time watch. It's the type of movie that has that made for TV quality but in a way that makes sense for something to watch on Netflix. Sometimes the dialogue and situations feel a bit far-fetched, but its heart is pure and for that, I enjoyed watching the movie. Overall it is a cute movie with a strong message that makes up for any storytelling flaws.",
