    "text": "**The Anatomy of a Good Movie**\n\nMovies, as a form of art and entertainment, have the remarkable ability to captivate audiences, evoke emotions, and leave a lasting impression. While personal tastes may vary, there are certain qualities that contribute to the greatness of a film. A good movie is more than just a sequence of moving images; it is a carefully crafted work of storytelling, cinematography, and performance that resonates with its audience on multiple levels.\n\nFirst and foremost, a good movie has a compelling narrative. Whether it's a gripping thriller, an epic adventure, or a heartfelt drama, the story serves as the foundation upon which everything else is built. A well-written screenplay keeps viewers engaged from beginning to end, with well-developed characters, intriguing plot twists, and meaningful themes that provoke thought and discussion.\n\nIn addition to a strong story, the visual elements of a movie are equally important. Cinematography plays a crucial role in creating the mood and atmosphere of a film, using lighting, framing, and camera movement to enhance the storytelling. From sweeping landscapes to intimate close-ups, every shot is carefully composed to evoke emotion and convey meaning.\n\nMoreover, a good movie is brought to life by talented actors who embody their characters with authenticity and depth. A convincing performance can elevate even the most ordinary of scenes, drawing viewers into the world of the film and making them care about the fate of its protagonists. Whether it's a seasoned veteran or a newcomer making their debut, the actors' dedication to their craft shines through, leaving a lasting impression on audiences.\n\nFurthermore, the audio aspects of a film, including the score and sound design, contribute significantly to its impact. A memorable soundtrack sets the tone for key moments, heightening tension, stirring emotions, or providing moments of levity. Meanwhile, meticulous sound design immerses viewers in the world of the film, whether it's the roar of an explosion, the whisper of wind through trees, or the subtle rustle of clothing.\n\nLastly, a good movie leaves a lasting impression, lingering in the minds of its audience long after the credits have rolled. Whether it's a thought-provoking message, a breathtaking visual spectacle, or a poignant emotional moment, the best films stay with us, shaping our perceptions and enriching our lives in ways both big and small.\n\nIn conclusion, a good movie is a multi-faceted work of art that excels in storytelling, cinematography, performance, and audio design. It engages audiences on an emotional and intellectual level, leaving a lasting impact that transcends the boundaries of time and space. From the classics of Hollywood's golden age to the latest blockbusters of today, the power of cinema to entertain, inspire, and move us remains as potent as ever.",

How can Dave's tab have Liz's data card? If she was that clever, she could destroy it. And finally what was the verdict? Kari is killed... that's it? That's why they were hugging in the court room? I am not going to believe in any of the Netflix documentary now on.",

Fico a pensar o qu\u00e3o \u00e9 doentio, uma pessoa deixar de viver sua vida para stalkear e perseguir outra, 125 emails por dia, como conseguem... Gente, e o caso tem reviravoltas dignas de suspense policial cinematogr\u00e1fico, da maneira mais tr\u00e1gica, dram\u00e1tica e triste poss\u00edvel... Tantas crian\u00e7as sofrendo nessa hist\u00f3ria... Doentio, perigoso se aventurar nos datings da vida atualmente... #Medo",

Not sure that\u2019s a good thing \ud83e\udd74 However, the suspense & detailed investigation made it worthwhile to watch. Extremely well done story telling & cinematography. Definitely glad I watched it.",

    "text": "When I watch a documentary like this about a love triangle gone way way wrong, I can't help but wonder why we can't find the mental help for people who need it. There is money for a lot of things, but we have an overabundance of mental illness in the US and guns, what could go wrong. This doc is another cautionary tale not to use Plenty of Fish as a dating site. The talking heads come off riveting at their best and boring at worst, but the story is what pushes this forward. I wanted to learn what happened and we eventually do. It is quick and satisfying and horrifying. Like a snickers bar! Final Score: 8.3/10",
