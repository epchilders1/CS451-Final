    "text": "Simple plot explanation - maybe some spoilers, nothing too major. \n\nJust a very generic time travel movie. Adam\u2019s dad invented time travel, but didn\u2019t know it. He later died in a car crash, and a past investor in his company took over the company, this person knew that he discovered time travel, and used it for bad. They went in the past and told themselves to invest in specific stocks and companies to emass a fortune. Adam\u2019s wife digs into the situation with the company, and discovers about the investor. She then time travels, and is tragically lost. Fast forward to what we actually see in the movie - adam steals a jet from the company, and time travels back, to try and find his wife. He accidently stops in the wrong period of time, and meets a younger version of himself, who he befriends and takes with him to the correct year, where they are to meet their father, and tell him to destroy the formula for time travel. \n                 Just a well rounded OKAY movie. Wasn\u2019t amazing. Did get kinda boring, and there wasn\u2019t a super engaging ending. Some good life lessons in this movie though.",

    "text": "nice script, nice story nice performance very exciting time travel movie. After movie Back to the Future 1985, The Adam Project has given scientific time traveling excitement. The most unique thing about this film was that a 12-year-old child is meeting his own youth, who has come from the year 2050. The film does not show the world of 2050, but despite this, it did not get boring. The best lesson was that tampering with nature causes a lot of damage.",

    "text": "A Time-Travel Loop with Heart\nWhat a delightful piece of cinematic engineering. While it may remind you of Back to the Future, The Adam Project is a far more clever and heartfelt journey.\nThis is a story built like a Mobius strip\u2014a single, continuous journey that twists back on itself. The humor, a sharp blend of wit and charisma, comes from this very paradox, as the older, cynical version of Adam learns from the raw emotions of his younger self.\nThe film is a perfect blend of high-octane action and a tender look at family. It's an exhilarating ride that ultimately proves that no matter the paradoxes of time, some bonds are truly unbreakable.",

    "text": "I really, really enjoyed this movie, but wasn't certain I would after reading reviews that stated it was simplistic or the same as other sci fi films, however, I beg to differ. This movie explored much more than what people have given it credit for. Familial relationships, grief, acceptance, growing up and the complexities of losing yourself to something dangerous because you have spent your life, and your money working towards it. Maya's character served as both an antagonist throughout but also a sense of self reflection. Adam was a very well crafted, flawed character that added comedy, excellently displayed by both Ryan Reynolds and Walker Scobell, but also realism. The scene of Adam (the pilot and the bullied, asthmatic sixth grader) playing catch with their father was both beautiful and daunting, acting as the key moment where you understand the sacrifices everyone had made. This was a lovely film to watch with my dad, and I simply loved the story line.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) El proyecto Adam es una de esas pel\u00edculas que no pretenden reinventar nada, pero lo que hacen, lo hacen bien. Tiene ese sabor a cine de aventuras ochentero que recuerda a Spielberg, con viajes en el tiempo, acci\u00f3n, momentos familiares que te aprietan el pecho y un toque de humor que ayuda a suavizarlo todo. La t\u00edpica pel\u00edcula que podr\u00eda haber sido un cl\u00e1sico del videoclub si hubiera salido hace 30 a\u00f1os.\n\nRyan Reynolds hace de s\u00ed mismo, como casi siempre, pero aqu\u00ed funciona. Y la sorpresa es Walker Scobell, que no solo aguanta el tipo frente a Reynolds, sino que consigue robarle planos. La din\u00e1mica entre ambos es el motor emocional de la historia. El reparto lo completa gente como Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner o Zoe Salda\u00f1a, que aportan solidez, aunque sus personajes no tengan tanto espacio para brillar.\n\nLa historia no es especialmente original: un piloto del futuro regresa al pasado para evitar una cat\u00e1strofe, y acaba reencontr\u00e1ndose con su yo infantil y con su familia. Pero no necesita m\u00e1s. El ritmo es \u00e1gil, la acci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bien medida y hay algunas escenas que consiguen emocionar de verdad. La clave est\u00e1 en c\u00f3mo combina todos esos elementos para hacerte sentir como cuando eras cr\u00edo y so\u00f1abas con salvar el mundo.\n\n\u00bfTiene fallos? Claro. A veces se pasa de sentimental, los giros cient\u00edficos no siempre tienen sentido y hay momentos en los que parece m\u00e1s una sucesi\u00f3n de clich\u00e9s que una historia nueva. Pero tambi\u00e9n es honesta, entra\u00f1able y, sobre todo, muy entretenida. De esas pelis que, sin darte cuenta, acabas viendo con una sonrisa en la cara.\n\nSin duda, una propuesta familiar que, sin ser perfecta, consigue algo mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil: hacerte olvidar el mundo durante un rato.\n\n(ENGLISH) The Adam Project is one of those films that doesn\u2019t try to reinvent anything, but what it does, it does well. It carries the spirit of '80s adventure films, reminiscent of Spielberg \u2014 time travel, action, heartfelt family moments, and just enough humor to keep things light. It\u2019s the kind of movie that could\u2019ve been a video store classic if it had come out 30 years ago.\n\nRyan Reynolds plays his usual self, as always, but it works here. And the surprise is Walker Scobell, who not only holds his own next to Reynolds but actually steals a few scenes. Their dynamic is the emotional core of the story. The cast also includes Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, who all do a solid job, even if their characters don\u2019t get much development.\n\nThe plot isn\u2019t particularly original: a pilot from the future comes back to the past to stop a catastrophe, and ends up reuniting with his younger self and his family. But it doesn\u2019t need more than that. The pacing is tight, the action is well-balanced, and there are a few genuinely moving moments. The magic lies in how it blends all these elements to make you feel like a kid again, dreaming about saving the world.\n\nAre there flaws? Of course. It leans a bit too hard into sentimentality at times, the science doesn\u2019t always hold up, and there are moments that feel more like a collection of clich\u00e9s than a fresh story. But it\u2019s also honest, endearing, and \u2014 above all \u2014 really entertaining. The kind of movie that leaves you smiling without even realizing it.\n\nDefinitely a family-friendly film that, while not perfect, pulls off something much harder: making you forget the real world for a while.",
