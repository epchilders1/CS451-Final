    "text": "\"The Sea Beast (2022)\" is one of the best kaiju movies I've seen in years! It's a mix between Godzilla, How to Train Your Dragon, and Pirates of the Caribbean. A very powerful combination that results in a very fun, if not slightly flawed, experience.\n\nThere are some pacing and story issues. The movie does drag in the middle and feels like it's a half hour longer than it needs to be. There's a few characters and plot points that are rather pointless to the main narrative and it does feel rather superfluous with its message at the end. The conflict between the humans and sea monsters feels a bit too easily resolved at the end, as well. But other than that, this is a great movie for all ages!\n\nVery colorful and beautifully animated, brimming with detail and gorgeous direction! The action scenes are riveting and the voice-acting is excellent. Our two main human characters are charming and very likable, but our titular \"Sea Beast\", aka Red, is the real showstopper. She has such a beautifully simplistic design and her animalistic behavior gives her so much charm and personality without completely humanizing her. She's become one of my new favorite kaiju in recent years!",

    "text": "This movie was a waste of time. It\u2019s basically \u201cHow to train a dragon\u201d but with the ocean and a giant red seal.\nThe story had so many plot holes and it could have been interesting, but never bothered to close them.\n\nThe climax made no sense, as there was nothing that foreshadowed it or even hinted at it.\n\nThe relationship between Jacob and the girl is so unbelievable. I am supposed to believe you feel an obligation to stop hunting beast after 3 days of riding it? But not an obligation to raise the girl that has nothing and saved you?\n\nThe vengeance was so shallow I didn\u2019t even care if the Captain lived or died (and it would have been so much more satisfying if he did!)\n\nHe put his crew at risk for vengeance of WHAT\u2026 no seriously what!\nThere was an off hand comment he made that lead to believe it was his eye? Compared to everyone else in the movie his vengeance was the most shallow and for as much as he hated the beasts it\u2019s was disproportionate.\n\nThe witch sence was cool and had great foreshadowing, but again never ment anything. It would have been so cool if the beast being alive ment that the bargain was not met and that he did own her everything. BUT NO NOTHING!\n\nAnd Red living is crazy too since she was still poisoned! It would have been so much more meaningful if the village came together to nurse her back to health. If the King and Queen had been fooled by their own ancestors and took the time to re-educate themselves.\nBut they were supposed to be making money on the death of the beast?! But HOW?! There was no hint at trading their horns or how they were valued. NOTHING! That is a speculation that I had to come up with myself because they a spoon feed me the obvious, but not the necessary context?!",

    "text": "The animation was really astonishing, particularly the water. The lore was well thought out and had an enjoyable world to explore. But this was essentially a B version of How to Train Your Dragon, except there was way less time developing Red than Toothless, so she wasn\u2019t as likeable. And the ending was really rushed. I would\u2019ve given another star if it landed the ending better but my family all thought it ended flat without getting to see how things would be after the resolution. It\u2019s an ok movie, but it had way more potential.",

    "text": "\"The Sea Beast\" is a 2022 Netflix animated film. In the film, the sea is full of sea monsters and our main character, Jacob, is a \"hunter\", a pirate that specializes in killing sea beasts. The parts of the story that focus on Jacob and the other hunters is really engaging, exciting and unlike the typical animated film. I give this film credit that it feels like it earns that \"PG\" rating, the action is rightfully intense, and the characters have a decent edge to them. I particularly like the relationship between Jacob and Captain Crow. The captain is a good fleshed out multi-dimensional character. It would have been easy to make him the obvious captain Ahab obsessed about revenge character, but the movie does give him scenes to show that he legitimately cares about Jacob. If the movie was to just focus on these characters, we would have had a real great swash buckling adventure.\n\nBut then the movie adds in a few other elements. Some work, some don't. They introduce the other main character of the story, a young orphan named Maisie. Doing this does make the film seem a bit more like your typical kids' movie, making an orphan child the P. O. V. Character. That being said, Maisie is a fun character. She has spent her life reading the tales of the hunters and is always excited to participate in the adventure.\n\nBut the movie then adds on another element that is totally unnecessary. They add in a villain. Now don't get me wrong, a villain can be a great thing in an animated film. Heck, I have been wanting Disney to give us another great villain for years. But this film didn't need one. The King and Queen decide that hunters are lame, and they don't need them anymore. A snooty captain then claims he can kill sea beasts better than Captain Crow. So, a competition is proposed for who can kill the big red sea beast first. You could cut out this whole subplot from the movie and save yourself 10 minutes of runtime.\n\nWhen the movie is a sort of Pirate/Moana story it is really good. When it becomes a discount \"How to Train your Dragon\" it becomes pretty standard stuff. The whole lesson about not judging others based on appearance or what people say about them is good. The problem is that same message has been done to death by dozens of other animated films. And what's worse, the movie tries to blame all prejudice in their world on a single person. The movie becomes very heavy handed towards the end. They had a great ending that visually showed their moral, but then the characters get up on a soapbox and tell the audience what the moral is. While at the same time passing the buck for all prejudice in the world onto one person.\n\nThere is also another storyline with Captain Crow that goes absolutely nowhere. Once again it could have been cut and nothing would have been missed. This movie is nearly 2 hours long, and it could have been trimmed down.\n\nIt may sound like I am being overly harsh on this movie. It is just that I really enjoyed the parts it did well, that is what makes the parts it falls short all the more frustrating. It is still a good movie I recommend you Sea it for yourself.",

    "text": "There\u2019s been a growing misconception, in a form of a double-edged sword, surrounding the animated medium for film. Production-wise, it\u2019s about deliverance and fun connections with continuous passions of artistic opportune expressions. A palpable, admirable gesture felt when watching the product, however particular demographics would say otherwise: there\u2019s underlying genericity in subtextual thematic messaging being rather told obviously as the story\u2019s main prompt, thus the freestyle approach is mere eye candy to divert children. Certain animated classics remain enjoyable between nostalgic and entertaining extents, with attractive style becoming another factor right next to a compelling story with potential ambition injected in writing. It doesn\u2019t apply as much as it used to, but it became a formula that led a lesser ratio of digitalized canvases to high acclaim and pleasant welcoming. Alas, more or less of those get underestimated and aren\u2019t added onto watchlist radars unless further persuaded to realize that there could be probable enjoyment. Chris Williams, who has a creative hand across many Disney animation till his exit in 2018, seems to be knowledgably equipped when he helmed Oscar nominated \u201cThe Sea Beast\u201d.\n\nCanonically taken inspiration from the \u201cMoby Dick\u201d legend, then mimic those notable live-action feats that contains such battle against a monstrous encounter of nature (i.e., \u201cDead Man\u2019s Chest\u201d comes to knowledgeable mind). Another inspiration Williams took to jumpstart the narrative is treating the mythical sea creatures\u2019 confrontations under attempted sympathetic depth as similarly witnessed in \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d. Both films show generationally nurtured hunters battling out with their predators, unexpectedly joined by one youthful soul who\u2019ll turn the historical tide upon opening a newfound perception no one yet see or even bother to acknowledge, leading up to unveiling the true antagonistic force at play. Agreeably so, viewers don\u2019t consider this endeavor anything special in the narrative nor worthwhile further engagement understandably in the medium, contrast to the critically acclaimed originality it beholds. Perhaps the similarities are unavoidable from frequently noted eyesight, but the originality stems from the significant reactive heft, building up to provoked subtexts that fits nicely.\n\nOur young heroine Maisie Brumble ran away from her orphanage to live adventurously, presumably in the stories she idolizes and frequently tell her fellow orphans\u2019 fueled excitements. The bedtime stories she gives her roommates speak of the legendary Inevitable crew roaming the seas hunting down terrifying monsters that wreak havoc against humankind. While celebrated as heroes and doing their best in following the codes with their fellow hunters, the crew, led by Captain Crow and his fearless first mate Jacob Holland, has set their eyes to take down the mightiest of all: the Red Bluster. However, stakes have been set up against them when royalty decided to deem them irrelevant over their supposedly inadequate pursuit for such, despite their previous captures filling up the trophy hall. Time couldn\u2019t be better when they find Maisie, whose late-parents were too hunters, stowed away onto their new voyage, which Crow admires though Jacob feels responsible since she encountered him earlier showing her fanatic admiration. Later, they finally encounter the Red Bluster, a confrontation that shall divide where they stand: Crow\u2019s forced to go unprecedented lengths to bring the creature down under newfound vengeance; while Maisie displays differential thought process that Jacob eventually comes around after observing a newfound insight onto uncharted territories, about to make history.\n\nWhen Williams visualized \u201cThe Sea Beast\u201d, the underlying ambition is the storytelling experience itself effectively crafted as the attractive peak. He\u2019s committed in providing outstanding animated fare amongst the ocean of many that didn\u2019t imaginatively push, with certain some easily garnered favorable momentum. Though he didn\u2019t muster enough steerage way from the formulaic structure as the narrative\u2019s rather instinctual in developmental buildup, he acknowledged the challenging landscape by showing his palpable grace in the entertaining approach, which is an additional similarity to \u201cDragon\u201d. What this film does weigh more than the other is applying certain apparatus onto its canvas to evoke exhilaration in the cinematographed framework of action sequences that actually replicate how they\u2019re usually done across genetically-shared blockbusters. That particular feat is impressive at best as it\u2019s uncommon for computer animation to flawlessly execute under certain circumstantial realism (\u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d remains the best in that intensity), thus fashioning a subtle referential testament to other well-known cinematic adventures being as dimensional as the conceptualized scope.\n\nAs you have visual storytelling being the animated significance, the soulful heart\u2019s the usual enrichment that exhibits the screenplay\u2019s strength. Jared Harris as Crow is as gritty and mindful as you\u2019d expect for a characterized conflict being the toughest to gesture towards the possibility regarding a changing realization that would initially anger him greatly, positioning him as the active antagonistic antihero besides crooked royalty. Harris voices Crow at the matching pitch of edgy sea captains performatively embraced, including vocally tuning pensive nuances. Karl Urban (\u201cStar Trek\u201d, \u201cThe Boys\u201d), at his first voice role, ranges freely as an energetic fearless explorer through Jacob, literally coded with loyalty genuinely paced, reactive amusement that would humorously sour his overall charisma burdened protectively, and fun spirited momentum. Zaris-Angel Hator truly brings Maisie out soulfully with youthfully advanced conviction when empathizing with not only the character\u2019s adventurous seeking but also the gritty passion when standing up for what she cares about, therefore becoming the generic messenger the film cleverly delivers like an obligated element that needed to be spoken.\n\n\u201cThe Sea Beast\u201d may be glanced then passed as an animated fare with its own particularly certain demographic direction, it\u2019s worth a watch. To describe the film\u2019s entertainment value is ranking it as a tier beneath \u201cHow to train Your Dragon\u201d with the difference being the latter\u2019s greatness scales the former to decent exceptionality. Engaging characterization remarking the fun-filled veins, especially how behaviorally similar the Red Bluster is to Toothless designed as a sea beast, while the animation innovatively attempted to mimic the genre\u2019s transcendences. Yes, attracted, or diverted, children will share Maisie\u2019s perspective as a seeming buildup into the genre\u2019s substantially-increased endeavors, while intrigued adults could appreciate in wonder over the art\u2019s form, layered heart and recognized humorous antics, with partial gratitude towards its messaging deliverance. Chris Williams excelled his objectives, and he ain\u2019t done with the story yet as months later after the film\u2019s release he\u2019s announced a sequel, which should be more interesting to see how it could move forward in distancing from a starter\u2019s similarities.
