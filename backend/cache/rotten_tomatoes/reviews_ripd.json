Wasn't a total waste of a couple of hours of my life, but it's not a very good movie.  \n\nStar studded....  Great actors in the movie acted well, but the story and all of the CGI just kind of kept it from being more than moderately enjoyable.\n\nA swing and a miss.",

I love Ryan Reynolds, but he wasn't even that great here. Plus the theming and tone was so inconsistent. Also, did not care for the CGI work at all. It was so bad it was kinda funny.",

I would recommend it as a light and silly choice for family night or a safe bet for your sixth graders slumber party",

Mary-Louise Parker has a fun supporting role that deserves more credit and of course Jeff Bridges shines as always.",

Then the acting at the end wasn\u2019t too good, but the comedy remained quite amazing just like the rest of the movie. Not poorly done, the comedy is odd but they don\u2019t overdo it, got some legendary actors, I suppose the music could be better, but at least in my POV, this is the best Ryan Reynolds movie I\u2019ve ever seen. And I even liked the movie Life so much that I watched it about 20 times already on Netflix. And that\u2019s how good this and that movie is. Definitely a must see if you can. Just don\u2019t watch the sequel because absolutely nothing about it is good or fits.",
