I was surprised to see Jennifer Aniston acting so raunchy and extremely funny at it. \n\nThe whole cast was assembled very well and it was good to see Luis Guzm\u00e1n in it, he also played a very funny part in the movie. We're the Millers is the type of movie you can see over and over again. My hats off to the entire cast for making me and other people with funny bones laugh.",

    "text": "(CASTELLANO) Somos los Miller no intenta revolucionar la comedia, solo quiere que te r\u00edas con su humor desvergonzado y sus situaciones absurdas. La historia es sencilla, pero cumple: un tipo que se dedica a trapichear se inventa una familia falsa para pasar droga por la frontera sin que le pillen. Para eso, se junta con una stripper, un chaval que no se entera de nada y una chica con mucho car\u00e1cter. Como te imaginas, todo se complica y el viaje se convierte en un desastre lleno de l\u00edos y situaciones absurdas. La pel\u00edcula sigue el estilo de las comedias americanas gamberras, con chistes que a veces funcionan y otros que no tanto, pero en general te hace pasar un rato divertido.\n\nEl reparto es uno de sus mayores aciertos. Jason Sudeikis domina la comedia con su humor sarc\u00e1stico y su habilidad para el timing c\u00f3mico, mientras que Jennifer Aniston aporta carisma y encaja bien en su papel. Sin embargo, el que realmente se roba la pel\u00edcula es Will Poulter, cuyo personaje de adolescente torpe y entra\u00f1able protagoniza algunos de los momentos m\u00e1s divertidos. Tambi\u00e9n destaca Ed Helms, que consigue darle un punto de locura a su papel de villano.\n\nNo es una comedia refinada ni lo pretende. Somos los Miller apuesta por un humor directo, con momentos absurdos que, aunque no siempre dan en el clavo, cumplen su funci\u00f3n. Es cierto que el desenlace es predecible y que algunas escenas podr\u00edan haber sido m\u00e1s \u00e1giles, pero si buscas una comedia ligera y sin pretensiones, es una opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s que v\u00e1lida para pasar el rato.\n\n(ENGLISH) We're the Millers doesn\u2019t try to reinvent comedy; it just wants to make you laugh with its shameless humor and absurd situations. The story is simple but effective: a small-time drug dealer comes up with a fake family to smuggle drugs across the border without getting caught. To pull it off, he teams up with a stripper, a clueless teenager, and a tough girl. As you can imagine, things quickly spiral out of control, turning the trip into a mess full of chaos and ridiculous situations. The movie follows the style of classic American raunchy comedies, with jokes that sometimes land and others that fall flat, but overall, it delivers a fun time.\n\nThe cast is one of its biggest strengths. Jason Sudeikis nails the comedic timing with his sarcastic humor, while Jennifer Aniston brings charisma and fits well into her role. However, the real scene-stealer is Will Poulter, whose awkward and endearing teenage character delivers some of the funniest moments. Ed Helms also stands out, adding a touch of craziness to his villainous role.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a refined comedy, and it doesn\u2019t try to be. We're the Millers goes for straightforward humor, with absurd moments that, while not always perfect, get the job done. The ending is predictable, and some scenes could have been tighter, but if you're looking for a lighthearted comedy without big ambitions, it\u2019s a solid choice for a good time.",

Some sexy scenes with an A-list star like Aniston don't hurt and in the end, I had a good time. Worth a watch or two over the years, but nothing to shout about. Unless you get bitten by a spider.",
