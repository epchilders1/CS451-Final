These families are incredibly brave to tell their stories. This also happened not far from where I live in Georgia. Huge blessings to these families as they navigate their new normal. Jacoba, you are awesome and so is the reporter! (I apologize for not remembering her name).",

Donald Cline is in The Quiverfull movement church primarily focuses on the marital relationship between one man and one woman and the blessing of children within that union. and there\nis no biblical or theological basis for a man to have children with multiple women!!! There's no biblical or theological basis within mainstream Christianity, or the Quiverfull movement itself, to justify a man having children with multiple women outside of marriage, and certainly not through deception or without consent.",

I'm GLAD THIS DOCUMENTARY WAS MADE, BECAUSE IT OPENS OUR MINDS AND SPREADS AWARENESS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS THAT HAPPEN. THIS DEFINITELY IS POSSIBLY STILL HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD. AND It's SICKENING. THIS IS A MUST-WATCH DOCUMENTARY. DEFINITELY, ADD IT TO YOUR LIST OF THINGS TO WATCH.",

I went into watching this without really a clue about anything it was about, and in the age of cell phones and social media it was one of those times where \"i didn't pick up my phone once.\" You immediately feel for the siblings and families featured here and leaves you dumbfounded about the way our laws work. A must see for anyone who loves a compelling documentary.",
