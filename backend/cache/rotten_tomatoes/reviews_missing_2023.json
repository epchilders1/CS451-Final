    "text": "The film is actually good: details from the beggining that we just dont get too much attention develops the story and makes the film more exciting, and the tension part is the best, which define a good thriller drama. The only trash was the final, which I expected to be more surprising and have a good reflection but it was the opposite, so if there was a good final, maybe it would be 5 stars, but because of this, im giving four stars",

The story effectively builds tension through a unique computer screen perspective, keeping viewers engaged despite some pacing issues and plot inconsistencies. With strong performances and an unpredictable plot twist, the film offers a modern thriller that highlights the dark and bright sides of technology.\n\nRead the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)",

    "text": "It's a fine thriller, but Searching 2: Missing ultimately feels like a rehash of its predecessor. While it maintains a gripping mystery, it lacks the raw emotional intensity of John Cho's performance in the first film, making it feel more like a formulaic retread than a true evolution of the concept.",

    "text": "With the omnipresence of technology in the world today, it seems like movies such as Missing could become a regular occurrence. There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be irritated by the gimmick, chief among which being that it doesn\u2019t feel very cinematic. Fortunately, Missing maintains a brisk pace and throws in enough twists and turns to keep you invested and guessing. Some of the reveals later on throw up more questions than answers, and it starts to feel like the film just wants to confuse and baffle you as much as possible. Also, the villains plan is ridiculously convoluted and it unfolds in the middle of a film that takes great pains to demonstrate how pretty much anything and anyone is trackable on the internet if you\u2019re determined enough, which means it makes even less sense. That being said, it\u2019s a movie that zips by, never dragging or wasting too much time, and the characters are well acted enough to make you care about them. If you can get past the fact that you\u2019re literally watching screens on a screen, then it\u2019s very enjoyable time.",

Only being able to see what's going on through the use of cameras and phone screens, and the growing tension as our lead slowly unearthed this mystery, made for an incredibly immersive thriller that'll surely keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended watch!!!",

Almost perfect but just one thing... all the visual effect and tricks are only possible in this internet-age, so it might be look aged badly in some years in future.",
