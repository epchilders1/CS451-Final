    "text": "I really liked this movie for its style, colors, and messaging, but it didn\u2019t feel as impactful to me as some other movies. Maybe it's not supposed to be incredible or impactful; maybe it's just a children's movie, a beautiful Wes Anderson targeted towards children. But I wanted a little more from it. The medium of stop motion feels very impactful and communicates the oddities and beauty, and colors of the world in a way that another medium could not. A 2d animation would lack depth, a 3d animation would be too smooth and devoid of personality. over all a great movie, but not a must-see. Maybe a must-see for a child\u2019s introduction to Wes Anderson and the themes he creates.",

    "text": "I think Fantastic Mr. Fox is an amazing film. I really like how the film explored the tension between who we are and who we're expected to be. I also appreciate the moral of the story for Mr. Fox being to not let personal pride/ego get in the way of loved ones. Moreover, Wes Anderson\u2019s distinct directional style is very clearly visible in Fantastic Mr. Fox; his use of symmetrical and meticulously designed sets, retro/vintage color scheme, and quirky characters are apparent throughout. Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and believe it is Wes Anderson\u2019s best film.",

    "text": "Wes Anderson\u2019s Fantastic Mr. Fox is a whimsical yet emotionally resonant stop-motion film that blends idiosyncratic style, warm humor, and textured visual craft to follow the charming but impulsive Mr. Fox as his uncontrollable thrill for raiding farms transforms an adventure into a fight for his family\u2019s and community\u2019s survival. Beneath its autumnal aesthetic, naturalistic voice performances, and the inviting score lies a thoughtful exploration of identity, centered on the tension between one\u2019s individual nature and the responsibilities owed to others. Mr. Fox\u2019s wildness\u2014authentic and appealing though it is\u2014endangers those around him, but the film resists the idea that individuality must be suppressed; instead, it suggests that personal nature can evolve within a communal context. As Mr. Fox learns to redirect his cleverness from self-serving heists to protecting and leading his community, and as characters like Ash navigate their own balance between standing out and belonging, the film reveals how unique traits can strengthen collective survival. Ultimately, Fantastic Mr. Fox succeeds as both a lively caper and a meditation on interdependence, celebrating the imperfect but meaningful balance between who we are and what we owe to the communities we\u2019re part of.",

    "text": "The Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really fun and creative movie. The stop-motion animation makes the film look unique, almost like a moving storybook, and it gives the characters a lot of charm. The animation also adds to the humor and style, making the world feel handmade and warm. I liked the movie overall, but the ending felt a little weird to me, the dancing scene was okay, but it could\u2019ve been more exciting or meaningful. The characters were still interesting and fun to watch. Overall, the movie had great visuals and a cool style, and I enjoyed most of it.",

So visually stunning, you can almost feel the autumn hues and felts through the screen. Simply put, Wes Anderson\u2019s uniqueness in style will never get old.",

    "text": "I think this film of Fantastic Mr. Fox has a very unique style that fits in with Wes Anderson and his creative technique in film marking. For example the color scheme, throughout the entire film the color depicted are warm shades of yellow, orange and red which is an element in many of Wes Anderson films. Anderson established the importance of colors and their symbolism within the storyline. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, specifically, the tan, bright colors depict the foxes' usual environment, home and place of work. Then once the foxes' home is flooded, they move into the sewer which has dark black and grey tones which symbolizes the darkness and the conflict they are facing in trying to hide from the farmers. The dark colors bring upon a shift in tone of the movie as the animals face their final climax and challenge.",

In this film we see Fantastic Mr. Fox\u2019s need to be a wild animal get him in trouble with not only his wife but with his whole community. Due to him breaking into the different farms he lost his home and the communities home. He only realizes that what he did was wrong when they get washed out of the sewer. He then changes to better him self for the community and takes responsibility for his actions. With this change we can see everyone is happy and he is finally content with his life, which is shown by Mrs. Fox announcing her pregnancy to her.",

    "text": "I overall really enjoyed this movie, and although I have seen it before I saw some pieces in a different way this time. I think stop motion effect is very significant in this movie, one way is through the size of the the foxes world, since the production uses actually mini items in these shots you can tell metaphorical size of their world. I think the stop motion was apparent when doing certain actions which was cool but also slightly disruptive to the story. I also felt there was a slight lack of character development for Mr. Fox.",

The setting change that Fantastic Fox and his family are now put in show the conflict they\u2019ve experienced that helps determine their struggles of survival, again, throughout the story. The stop motion animation technique creates a unique aesthetic and storytelling of the film in ways to recognized the hard work of the creator of the movie and how well put emotions were added to emphasize the characters. It is definitely worth watching especially is dry humor is for you.",

    "text": "Fantastic Mr Fox is really good in what it does. It has a distinct feel to it that elevates it above most animated stop-motion films. The color and sets are incredible, and left me wondering how they even animated some of these scenes. I also enjoyed the reoccurring theme that would play about the three farmers. One scene that really stood out to me was the waterfall scene in the sewers. It was just a spectacle to watch. I do feel that the story had odd pacing. It was very strong in the beginning, but it really slowed down too much near the end in my opinion. It also felt that the conflict was resolved too quickly end off time, and there was never any true danger for the characters, so it lacked tension. But overall, the great film style and directional chooses made up for the alright storytelling.",

Using the animals VS humans really helps develop the fox's ability to think of others instead of himself. The color choices in the movie were very different from your regular movie, too. Instead of using regular colors, the movie stands out with the orange and yellows that come with fall.",

    "text": "Fantastic, the Film.\n\nWe all needed that not so youthful but handsome actor to portray Mr Fox. He is George Clooney with that more handsome voice than those like Sam Rockwell or Denis Leary. In addition, you got Meryl Streep portraying his wife, which makes you feel, judging by the cast, a warm classic. And Owen Wilson is in it (I fall for him ever since he started in Pixar' \"Cars\").\n\nIt is loveable the way they chaptered scenes.\n\nA good part is whenever somebody swears, they say \"cuss\". Just because it is a family movie, does not mean it is a kids movie (I.e: \"Flushed Away\").\n\nOh, & it is so silly. Like when Mr Fox said Ash was wearing a bandit hat (made from an old long sock) to keep his ears warm (there were holes for ears). The animals even count in Fox years.\n\nLoved the animation & style to it. It was charming amateur puppetry stop-motion where characters cannot smile or frown (like in \"Bob the Builder\"). You even know the 3 human men - fat, short & lean - were the antagonists with their realistic appearance & intimidating faces. Can you get a chuckle when the 3 Bs named was the name of the supermarket?\n\nAnd about the supermarket, did you know it was set in modern times? Like that office Mr Fox entered had itself an iMac in the room.\n\nFANTASTIC FACTS: The voice acting was done in various outside locations & we all met it when we were little.\n\nMay look into more Wes Anderson movies.",
