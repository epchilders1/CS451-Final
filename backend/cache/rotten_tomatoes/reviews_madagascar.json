    "text": "One of the worst DreamWorks movies ever made!\nThe animation is terrible, even for 2005 standards because Shrek 2 and Shark Tale came out one year prior and their animation looked better than this, for some reason Madagascar has the same budget shark Tale and they couldn\u2019t even make it that good. It makes me wonder where did the budget go?\nThe reason why I bring up the terrible animation is because most of the time you get characters close-up onto the screen either screaming, smiling or crying, makes me wonder if this film was intended as a torture device because it makes the film so creepy. I feel like DreamWorks must\u2019ve rushed through this and spent all their work on Wallace and Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.\nAlso, I hated Alex the lion in this one because he so unlikeable and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was originally going to be the villain of the film, if that\u2019s true, the change might have happened at the last minute.",

    "text": "\u00a1Qu\u00e9 divertida pel\u00edcula es \"Madagascar\"! Algo que amo de las pel\u00edculas de Dreamworks de inicios de los 2000 es su versatilidad para tener un humor m\u00e1s infantil, con chistes de doble sentido planteados de gran forma dentro de la trama; pero sin olvidar una historia que vaya m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de centrarse \u00fanicamente en la aventura. S\u00ed, puede tener escenas tan perfectas en cuanto a comedia que, a 20 a\u00f1os de su estreno, siguen plasmadas en la cultura pop, pero tambi\u00e9n esta historia puede tener como eje central la amistad, y c\u00f3mo un verdadero amigo siempre podr\u00e1 compartir su felicidad contigo.\n\nMe encant\u00f3 c\u00f3mo la pel\u00edcula desarroll\u00f3 el deseo tan diametralmente opuesto entre Marty y \u00c1lex. Mientras Marty deseaba salir del zool\u00f3gico y experimentar qu\u00e9 hay m\u00e1s all\u00e1, \u00c1lex disfrutaba la monoton\u00eda del zool\u00f3gico, donde a pesar de tenerlo todo, le faltaba lo que Marty m\u00e1s deseaba. Y la pel\u00edcula desarrolla estas dos posturas de gran forma, donde en la resoluci\u00f3n del mismo, ambas ideas colisionan al mostrar la imperfecci\u00f3n de las mismas. Y esa resoluci\u00f3n me pareci\u00f3 brillante, porque mientras otras pel\u00edculas tratan su idea central desde el utilitarismo, donde solo una postura es la correcta, esta abre la discusi\u00f3n y nos demuestra c\u00f3mo no hay una resoluci\u00f3n enteramente positiva, sino una a la que desde nuestra individualidad nos acomodamos, pero no por ello tenemos que condicionar a los dem\u00e1s a aceptar esa idea como \u00fanica opci\u00f3n; siendo justamente el cl\u00edmax c\u00f3mo ambos dejan de anteponerse a su felicidad para compartirla con los que los rodean, ya que no tendr\u00eda sentido tener todo lo que queremos si no tenemos con quien disfrutarlo.\n\nPero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso, esta pel\u00edcula es divertid\u00edsima. Todos los dise\u00f1os de los animales son en serio adorables, y casi cada chiste de cada uno funciona. Es triste que ya no se hagan pel\u00edculas animadas tan honestas, donde a trav\u00e9s de una trama sencilla se puedan abordar temas m\u00e1s complejos, pero sin perder la chispa para que el mensaje no se vuelva tedioso. Por algo el p\u00fablico de todas las edades dictamin\u00f3 a esta cinta como una de las m\u00e1s ic\u00f3nicas de la animaci\u00f3n de tiempos recientes.",

    "text": "A 00's Animated Classic. The voice acting is really good. It's quite an accomplishment in that this has like 7+ animals in it and manages to make all of them stand out and memorable. Outside of Alex & Marty there really isn't any character depth though. It's pretty solid all around besides that. The animation is dated and can be a little cheap looking also but it does a good job being comedic. That's one of the biggest strengths here. It's pretty funny actually and a lot of it is just good old fashioned slap stick and it's really well done and goes on for long periods. This is very much a comedy first and an adventure second. That means the plot can be very razor thin. There isn't any deep message here either. Are the jokes laugh out loud or iconic? Not really this isn't Airplane! and the references ones can be out of place. But it's fun, the characters are memorable, and it does a good job keeping everyone together and not jumping around constantly. Save for the opening. If your a fan of any voice actors here, animated comedies, or 00's animated movies check this out.",

    "text": "Madagascar bursts off the screen like a party for your funny bone. The film\u2019s irresistible charm lies in its rapid-fire dialogue and clever character interactions, transforming a zoo break-out into a hilarious odyssey. From the moment four pampered New York animals tumble into the wild, the screenplay\u2019s sharp wit keeps the laughs rolling.\nThe real magic happens whenever Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria trade barbs.\n\nAlex\u2019s star-struck bewilderment plays perfectly against Marty\u2019s sardonic quips.\n\nMelman\u2019s hypochondriac woes elicit sympathetic chuckles, especially when hijacked by King Julien\u2019s madness.\n\nGloria\u2019s sassy comebacks ground the group\u2019s chaos with heartfelt levity.\n\nBen Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith deliver pitch-perfect comedic timing. Their distinct rhythms and improv-flavored energy elevate mundane zoo routines into laugh-out-loud set pieces. Together, they turn an animated adventure into an improv showcase.\nMadagascar\u2019s humor never feels dated because it balances clever wordplay with universal fish-out-of-water scenarios. Its quotable one-liners and vibrant pace appeal to both kids and adults, ensuring family movie nights remain filled with giggles and groans alike.",

    "text": "For being back in 2005, I took for granted this freaking animation style, it still looks freaking good 25 years later!!. Marty and Alex are the best friends dynamic duo. im glad it was created, and he is the bestie that is self-conceited lol. Spy penguins, ugh, my goodness, greatness right there. I am so glad they got their own spinoff TV show. Well deserved, so funny, can't stop laughing with all the animals. High-class freaking zoo, only if that was a real thing, I would be at that thing almost every day, even if I don't have any kids. Great concept for a starter and a first movie to start a series on exploring the outside world of the zoo, I would be extremely curious too!!.  Haha, good joke lol when he picked up the phone and talked all the humans hear is the roaring, that's what I've been thinking my whole life, how animals talk, and that's a language humans will never be able to learn, unless you are a special type of person. For being in 2005, that trippy effect after being shot in the butt was great. I enjoyed that very random, but I enjoyed it. So many great adult jokes in this movie, im so glad none of that clicked for me until now, once I finally rewatched this movie, too funny. Man, you all really made a dark turn for the animals to realize reality sucks like a mf and what a savior for penguins, time to go home, Greta movie!!",
