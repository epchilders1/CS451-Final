    "text": "The entire cast and script is to set up Cruise as an unstoppable, genius, superhuman killer, yet the plot devices and moments don't quite work. The dialogue is cheesy. The plot is convuluted and forgettable. The scenes and Pittsburgh looks great. The sound design and overall the first scene of the sniping is really good. It has some interesting things going on, but overall not a good movie.",

Cruise shines as both actor and producer, always delivering quality movies. The first film was great, but the second was even better\u2014like his Top Gun films, they\u2019re thrilling and well-made. Don\u2019t listen to the bad reviews; these movies are definitely worth watching!",

Gritty, intense, analytical, twists and turns, great action and enough suspense. Cinematography is upper class. Whole cast excels in character. The best Reacher imo, highly recommended",

    "text": "In the film \"Jack Reacher\" Tom Cruise essentially plays the same Ethan Hunt. But here he is absolutely free.\n\nHe does not depend on his superiors, colleagues or missions. He is a kind of tramp from old westerns mixed with detectives from the 40s.\n\nThe plot of the film is a pure detective story, then it is a thriller and only then Tom Cruise's genre - an action movie.\n\nThe film has excellently staged fights, the main character misses one blow after another, uses techniques that a military man or a special forces person could use. Despite the fact that there are many action scenes in the film, the film itself is rather slow compared to other works of Cruise.\n\nI really liked the motley crew of antagonists. Imagine that the producers and screenwriters discussed who to take for these roles.\n\nOur team of villains is:\n- German director (Werner Herzog)\n- Not a very good Australian actor (Jai Courtney)\n- Bodybuilder of Russian origin (Vladimir Sizov)\n\nWho came up with this cast? I don't know, but it was perfect.\n\n\"Jack Reacher\" is a thriller-detective in which all the necessary ingredients for this genre come together at once.",

I know some folks say he\u2019s not right for it because he\u2019s not 6'4\", but if you haven\u2019t read the book, he totally owns it. The pacing\u2019s tight with no wasted scenes, and the chemistry between Tom and Rosamund is legit. If you\u2019re into crime-solving movies, definitely check it out.",

The film is a thoroughly entertaining crime thriller, featuring a standout scene\u2014a creative beatdown in an upstairs hallway. Werner Herzog, as the head of a criminal organization, portrays a mysterious and haunting individual. His chilling accent perfectly complements the character's enigmatic persona.",
