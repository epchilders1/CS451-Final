I thought this was going to be a disaster movie, not a speed run through boring exposition and smug, formless dialogue. I can't recommend it to anyone in good conscience, but if you absolutely have to watch it for some reason, do yourself a huge favor and skip the first hour and thirty minutes. Even then, temper your expectations.",

The CGI in this film is so bad that I can't even watch it through to the end. The only good thing about this immense mess is the well-stacked cast.",

I gave it 2 stars because the special effects were decent, and the acting was not that bad.  It was the story writing that was just full of holes.   You could get away with that kind of incoherent fiction back in the 1950's, 60's, 70's and 80's but not today.",

    "text": "Geostorm is the kind of movie that makes you wish for a real apocalypse just to escape its runtime. Directed by Dean Devlin, this sci-fi disaster flick tries to sell us on a world-saving weather satellite system but delivers a storm of stupidity so fierce it could sink Atlantis.\n\nPicture this: Earth\u2019s climate is controlled by a space gizmo that\u2019s basically a glorified sprinkler system with a \u201ccause tsunami\u201d button. Gerard Butler, growling like he\u2019s auditioning for a gravel-voiced GPS, plays Jake Lawson, a scientist-astronaut tasked with stopping the machine from turning cities into CGI slushies. Spoiler: he doesn\u2019t stop the film from freezing your brain cells.\n\nThe script is a Category 5 disaster, with dialogue so clunky it could anchor a cruise ship. Gems like \u201cThe storm\u2019s not the problem\u2014it\u2019s the conspiracy!\u201d sound like they were scribbled on a napkin during a power outage. The cast, including a sleepwalking Ed Harris and a \u201cwho\u2019s that?\u201d Jim Sturgess, wade through this mess like they\u2019re contractually obligated to drown. Subplots about family drama and a tacked-on romance have all the spark of a damp matchstick.\n\nVisually, Geostorm is a budget-bin Michael Bay knockoff. The effects look like they were rendered by a toaster, with storms so fake you\u2019ll swear they\u2019re stock footage from a weather app. The science? Let\u2019s just say it makes flat-Earth YouTube videos seem peer-reviewed. Satellites zapping instant blizzards and heatwaves? Sure, and my toaster can probably time-travel.\n\nPacing is slower than a sloth in a snowstorm, lurching between explosions and yawn-inducing \u201cplot twists\u201d you\u2019ll see coming from orbit. By the time the villain\u2019s revealed, you\u2019ll be too busy checking your watch to care.\n\nGeostorm wants to be Armageddon but ends up a cinematic fart in a windstorm\u2014loud, embarrassing, and gone in a whiff. Watch it for laughs with friends and a strong drink, or better yet, let this one blow away. Your Netflix queue deserves better.",

Zero chemistry between the actors, especially the second and third level characters who seem to just be there to show some sort of clout.   Typical evil white, male villain tops off this crap show that unfortunately has just continued that trope more than ever.",

I did see that Ed Harris, Richard Schiff, and Andy Garcia were in it and like Charlie Brown, queued up to kick the football and landed on my foolish, gullible butt. Augh.\n\nI volunteer teaching creative writing to kids. If these children had workshopped this script they would have thrown it out for the ridiculous dialogue, inane plot, and transparent characters. \n\nI continued hoping the geostorm would strike while I was watching the movie to give me the sweet release of death.",
