The perfect casting and wonderful acting made it easy to watch till the end. The supporting actors never over played their rolls. The only problem I had was the standing out in the cold and all the candles in the room. Could I watch again someday, yes and so it receives 5 stars.",

    "text": "If you like to be manipulated, then by all means - enjoy this ham-fisted romantic, holiday, personal tragedy movie. But if you have a hard time swallowing lots of coincidences and manipulative plot devices, then walk away.\nPlus, as if the contrived plot weren't enough, the two leads had very little chemistry with Barrett Doss basically sleep-walking through the movie. \nThe script was an amalgamation of every Hallmark movie slapped together by some AI algorithm.\nThe plot is this: A rich, best-selling author learns that his mom died and has to return to his small-town home that brings back pain from his brother's death and his dad abandoning the family... during Christmas. But wait, that's only part of the story because at his family home he encounters an adopted girl, who's about to get married to a boring man, seeking information about her mom who happened to live in this house and secretly left behind a diary... oh yeah, and her birthday is coming up soon.\nIt's as if this writer tried to cram in as many emotional holidays, special days and childhood trauma into one story as possible. I'm surprised the girl wasn't about to give birth before graduating from college while learning that she's got cancer!\nThere were other subplots in this film, but they're all terribly trite. \nThe problem with jamming in too many ideas into one story is that none of them felt real: the house gets cleaned up in minutes, a book is read in minutes and forgiveness is granted in minutes. Compressed time prevents the audience from feeling the real weight of an emotion.\nJustin was good- if that's enough, then go for it. But on a story-level, this was good direction trying to mask the poor writing of a story that should have been a mini-series. Can't recommend.",

The Noel Diary is a compelling movie centred around two people whose lives are missing an emotional and loving attachment to their families. \n\nThe two main characters are special together and the development of their relationship is easy and believable\n\nNot a romcom Christmas movie at all.  Happens to take place around Christmas and truly is a satisfying watch.  Directing, Acting, Plot in this world of wars and you know what  is a great break from the realities of life.",

    "text": "It\u2019s hard to get past the fact that the entire premise of this feel good Christmas movie is an engaged woman cheating on her fianc\u00e9. The two main characters have no chemistry, yet they open up about their deepest secrets minutes into meeting each other. The backstory about the main male character\u2019s family troubles and estranged mother makes no sense and is never fully explained. The movie was entertaining because of how ridiculous it is.",

The well-intentioned betrothed woman offers to help the stranger deal with lingering family issues. At her insistence, The woman goes on a road trip with the man she just met so he can reconcile with his father.\n\nThe betrothed woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9 stays home to plan their future together and supports his fianc\u00e9\u2019s decision to help this man he\u2019s never met. The engaged couple remains in contact during the road trip while the woman spends numerous nights in hotels with the attractive man. The betrothed man is depicted as everything women claim they want in a relationship. Her fianc\u00e9 is communicative, attentive, caring, trusting, supportive and loving. He displays no hint of insecurity or jealousy. Their relationship is presented as otherwise ideal. No underlying issues or problems between the couple are revealed. For all intents and purposes, they are happily engaged.\n\nLittle does the woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9 know she is cheating on him, sleeping with the handsome man she has known only a week. The woman comes home in time for Christmas Eve and unceremoniously dumps her fianc\u00e9 for the handsome stranger. Merry Christmas.\n\nIn a cruel twist, the story is told from the betrothed woman\u2019s point of view and presented as an uplifting holiday movie. Who approved this script? How did this movie get green-lit? Bah. Humbug!",

Some of the continuity was lacking -- wouldn't a Range Rover in a snow storm have defrosters and not a lot of snow on the windshield?  Does it make sense that he was having through with the fire in the fireplace, then just leaves it?  If Justin Hartley does not play the piano, it was a good hand double.  I liked this movie and might watch it again.  Or maybe not, only because of the ending.",

Their relationship built in such a realistic manner, that it beg for a continuation. I watched this movie a few years ago, and just came across it again. I cried at the same spots and wanted the movie to go on at the end. Critics bias clearly seen in some of the other comments.  This was a very entertaining movie.",
